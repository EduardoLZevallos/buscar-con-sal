<p><strong>NICARAGUA'S SPEECH<br />
14th September, 2021<br />
Human Rights Council<br />
Geneva, Switzerland</strong><br />
 <br />
We send greetings on behalf of our Heroic, Brave and Noble People, on the eve of the Great Battle of San Jacinto, which marked us forever with the Duty to fight against any form of Colonialism, Imperialism, Interventionism, Interference or Intrusion in our internal affairs.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, 14th September, we celebrate in our Nicaragua, Blessed, Proud and Always Free Motherland, the 165th Anniversary of that Heroic and Sublime Battle, in which Nicaraguan Patriots defended National Honor and Decorum, against the expansionist filibusterism of Yankee Imperialism, in a brilliant Epic that makes all Nicaraguans children of that Great Battle, and ardent Defenders of our Strong and Courageous Nation, Always traveling upon Paths of National Sovereignty.</p>

<p>Once again we appear before this Council with the pride of being descendants of Darío, Nicarao, Diriangén, Andrés Castro, Zeledón, Sandino, Carlos, in a History of Struggle for Sovereignty and Independence, arriving at our Bicentennial Year with our heads held up high and with the Conscience to Fight, Fight, Fight, in order to Win, Win, Win; with Reason and Heart, with Truth, Light and Life as Triumphant Banners.</p>

<p>We know our Present as well as what is on our Horizon.</p>

<p>We Move Always Forward, denouncing, fighting with Love, full of Hope, in the Inspiration of a Sun that illuminates us, and that never declines, a Sun that already announces so many New Victories of Faith and Good Will.</p>

<p>Below a copy of the Position expressed by Nicaragua in this very same Council on 22nd June of this year. We consider it necessary to repeat these Words that are of Glory and Victories, because they represent with Courage and True Vocation of Independence, the infinite Strength of a People that Overcome, on a daily basis, all forms of disrespect, aggression, and dominance claims of a sinful Imperialist, Colonialist and Capitalist Model, that the Free Peoples of the Earth are already changing.</p>

<p>So we say:</p>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity represents within this Council, the Noble, Brave and Hardworking People of Nicaragua, with their heads held high and the Pride of being Protagonists of a History of Struggle for our National Sovereignty, our Independence, and even more so, in the Year of the Bicentennial.<br />
 <br />
We have the right to live in peace. We have the right to respect. We have the right to Peace, which we have been building so hard after centuries of aggression, meddling and intervention by the United States of America and the complicit European Powers, which have sought to maintain imperialist and colonial domination over our Free, Sovereign and Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>We stand before this Council to ratify the Vigor, Glory and Historical Truths of the Nicaraguan People, who are emancipated and have risen with a Soul of Victories, in the face of the same aggressors. We have the Honor of defending our Motherland, defending the Interests and the Rights of a People that advance, in its own Values and Cultures, a People that have been recognized throughout the years, as an inspiration and an example of Peoples in Struggle.</p>

<p>In recent days we have courageously lived and confronted the same interventionist practices that we have come to know and defeat. From William Walker, American filibuster, white supremacist and enslaver, self-proclaimed President of Nicaragua, and before and after that, even in the midst of wars, interventions and military occupations by the United States that murdered our Patriot Generals, Fathers of our National Dignity, Benjamin Zeledón and Augusto Sandino; or when the successive and warmongering American presidents that declared themselves "contras", with great hypocrisy and in the crudest of shamelessness...</p>

<p>Nicaragua has faced the indecent greed of the United States and Europe, which has used all the vices of its own decadence to try to dismantle and dissuade National Honor and the Spirit of Sandinismo. The fact is that the immoral and obvious imperial American and European, colonial and neocolonial greed, with their alleged pretensions of manifest destinies, have always sought and continue to seek, our strategic and privileged geographical position.</p>

<p>We have confronted them with Bravery, Dignity, Humility, Good Faith and with the Valuable Experience of Dialogue and Peaceful Coexistence, with a Culture of Reconciliation and Concord, which despite so many warlike perversions, is maintained, and increased, between the Nicaraguan People and the State.</p>

<p>Madam President,</p>

<p>Sister and Brother Delegates:</p>

<p>We stand before this Council to defend Justice and Peace. The Right of Nicaragua to Live in Justice and Peace. The Right to Live Without Foreign Interference. The Right to Live our Destiny of Heroic People, that will never submit to the impositions of the Imperial Powers.</p>

<p>We come to this Council to say Enough. Enough with the reproducing of the interventionist discourse of those who intend to dictate our Laws and Decisions, our Ways and Models of Life - in Organizations that supposedly should serve for the defense of Human Rights, nullifying our Sovereignty, pretending to impose attitudes that are foreign to our Culture and Idiosyncrasy, in that arrogant, self-righteous and inappropriate desire to dominate a Country and a People, which owe their suffering and pain to Imperialism and Colonialisms, in all of its forms.</p>

<p>Madam President,</p>

<p>Sisters and Brother Delegates:</p>

<p>We come to this Council to denounce the United States, as well as the European Powers that are its accomplices, and to denounce its immoral and indecent Policy of aggressive, arbitrary, illegal, coercive and unilateral measures that violate all the Instruments of International Law.</p>

<p>We come to denounce, and will continue to denounce, Colonial Europe, and the United States, "Invader of Our America"... as the Immortal and Universal Nicaraguan, Rubén Darío referred to them... and so we denounce them here today, as invaders, conquerors and assailants of the Law, of the Heritages and of the Sovereignty of our Peoples.</p>

<p>We come to this Council to demand justice for Nicaragua. Justice for Nicaraguan Families. Justice for a People of Faith, of Values, of Ideals that never surrender, of Communities that, as our General Sandino said, we neither sell, nor surrender, never.</p>

<p>In Nicaragua, Blessed, Sovereign and Always Free, there are Laws. And those Laws are respected. They are laws similar or equal to that of any country in the world. But they, the Imperialists, they have them and apply them, while they do not recognize our Right to apply our similar Laws of Defense and Loyalty to the Motherland.</p>

<p>They attack us, because the people who are facing Nicaraguan Justice, are their sad and failed employees, unfortunately the Traitors of always, who have committed crimes against sovereignty, independence, security and peace in our Nicaragua.<br />
 <br />
Anything else that is said in this Council is part of that same strategy of defamation, of denigrating messaging, and of pretensions to humiliate and subjugate a country and a people that owes nothing, and fears nothing.</p>

<p>We have come to denounce, repeatedly, that American and European imperialists and their interfering policies and actions, violate International Law and the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>Know, Brothers and Sisters of the World, that in Nicaragua there is a Hardworking, Dignified, Loving, Supportive, Fraternal People, that identifies with the best Causes, the Causes of Justice, True Life, Freedom and the Right to Work, Security and Peace, Health, Education, Prosperity... Those are our Purposes, and those are the realizations of our Nicaragua.</p>

<p>We advance in spite of the Imperialists of the Earth, in all their criminal complicities, because we are worthy and hardworking, and because we are nobody's Colony! And we are moving forward with Joy, towards the fulfillment of the Goals set by the United Nations, for a Good, Just, Harmonious, Sustainable Life, and with the Right to Development for All!!</p>
