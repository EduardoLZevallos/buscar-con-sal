            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : Dr. Rosales, can you give us a brief
            account of ALBA's importance for Nicaragua's economy?<br>
            <br>
            Dr. Antenor Rosales Bola&ntilde;os : There's no question
            that any analysis of the Nicaraguan economy has to take the
            Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas into account in the
            sense that it's fundamental for a country like Nicaragua in
            the development of social and economic programmes. We have
            to remember that prior to the current government of
            reconciliation and national unity, in Nicaragua we were
            unable to generate the energy the country needed for
            production. Nor, of course, did we have the capacity to
            generate the energy needed by the population in general.<br>
            <br>
            In 2007 one can clearly see that as a result of ALBA,
            Nicaragua began a process that would ensure the production
            of energy so as to make the notorious power cuts that were a
            feature in Nicaragua a thing of the past under the
            government of reconciliation and national unity. No economy
            can sustain itself let alone grow without the capacity to
            generate and distribute energy developed throughout the
            country and especially in the regions, areas and sectors of
            the economy that need it most. That's the first point to
            make , the transcendent role of ALBA in Nicaragua in the
            generation of the energy needed for production. It is an
            element we cannot avoid stressing from the outset of any
            analysis.<br>
            <br>
            Next we have to point out that ALBA has been decisive in
            enabling us to meet one of the central&nbsp; formulations of
            Nicaragua's trade policy. Nicaragua's trade policy is based
            on the need to increase our exports given that we have an
            agro-export model subject to and influenced by the
            limitations characteristic of a country like Nicaragua. A
            small economy. A vulnerable economy. An economy without
            natural energy resources.<br>
            <br>
            We depend on oil. To date we do not produce oil. So for the
            export development model which has been the path taken by
            Nicaragua to achieve its current levels, the impact of trade
            is decisive. Self-evidently, ALBA and especially Venezuela
            in this context have played a fundamental role, because it
            has now established itself as Nicaragua's second export
            market.<br>
            <br>
            Historically, up until 2006, Nicaragua's principal market
            used to be Central America, but with the Free Trade
            Agreement with the United States and with the arrival of the
            Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas, our reality is
            different. The United States is the first market for
            Nicaraguan products but the second market, growing
            substantially, is Venezuela.<br>
            <br>
            In this way, we are meeting one of the central elements of
            Nicaragua's trade policy, market diversification. And,
            before, we depended a great deal on the Central American
            market and the United States market. Now, we are talking
            about the United States market, the Venezuelan market, the
            Central American market, the Russian market to which we are
            exporting meat and where we are interested in developing
            agricultural investment projects , in cacao for example. And
            there is the Agreement of Association with the European
            Union.<br>
            <br>
            Thus, it's clear that with ALBA this expression of the
            national interest, the opening up of new markets, has been
            realised and of course the opening up of the supply of new
            products to overseas markets. If you recall, we have
            typically exported cattle and coffee. With ALBA now, a new
            market has opened, but also new products, for example black
            beans, which were not part of Nicaragua's export production.
            Given the demand in Venezuela, the demand in that ALBA
            member country, Nicaragua funds the production of black
            beans for export to the Venezuelan market.<br>
            <br>
            Both from the point of view of energy generation and from
            the point of view of trade and of the supply of oil
            guaranteed under Petrocaribe, the vision of ALBA has been
            decisive in driving economic planning without forgetting or
            understating the importance of ALBA's development
            cooperation on social programs in Nicaragua promoted by our
            government of reconciliation and national unity.<br>
            <br>
            TcS :&nbsp; Would it be true to say that ALBA has managed to
            solve definitively some of the Nicaraguan economy's basic
            structural problems?<br>
            <br>
            Antenor Rosales : The supply of oil from Venezuela, a member
            of ALBA, within the Petrocaribe framework, has been vital to
            develop the social and economic program of this government.
            We ought to remember that via Petrocaribe Venezuela supplies
            us with 10,000 barrels of oil a day. Obviously that has a
            direct impact on the national economy because Nicaragua is
            still not able to generate energy with other kinds of
            resources that would allow us to develop Nicaragua's
            complete productive capacity. We have the potential to
            produce wind power, hydroelectric power taking advantage of
            our water resources, geothermal power from the range of
            volcanoes in Nicaragua and obviously oil based power.<br>
            <br>
            As we change Nicaragua's energy generating base, oil supply
            from Venezuela will continue being decisive for any
            government in Nicaragua. It is impossible to imagine a
            government in Nicaragua that would not have a relationship
            with Venezuela, self-evidently within the ALBA
            framework,&nbsp; that would allow that supply of oil which
            supersedes the agreement of earlier decades known as the San
            Jos&eacute; Pact under which Mexico and Venezuela supplied
            Central American coutnries with oil under certain
            conditions.<br>
            <br>
            So that supply of oil guaranteed by Venezuela, a member
            country of ALBA along with Nicaragua, along with the
            Nicaragua's exports and the fact that Venezuela has become
            our second export market have been crucial in achieving the
            national economy's levels of growth. Remember we have had
            growth of around 4% and last year of 4.5% in our gross
            domestic product, basically thanks to the policies of the
            Nicaraguan government together with the full participation
            of the private sector&nbsp; which has led to growth in
            Nicaraguan exports and especially agriculture related
            exports without forgetting manufacturing exports.<br>
            <br>
            But it is obvious that the sale of cattle, of meat, of milk,
            of sea foods, of gold have all turned Nicaragua's
            agro-export model into a vital factor that has lessened the
            effects of the international economic crisis felt in all the
            countries of the world and especially in our region. We can
            see that in 2009 which was the most complicated point of the
            international economic crisis, the drop in Nicaragua's
            economy was only 1.5%, much less than occurred in other
            Central American countries. There's no doubt that would have
            been much harder to contain in Nicaragua if the power cuts
            that affected Nicaragua before this government of
            reconciliation and national unity had continued.<br>
            <br>
            TcS: What effect has ALBA had on employment and other
            factors important in the country's economic development?<br>
            <br>
            Antenor Rosales: Employment is of great importance in
            analysing the economic situation of a society, particularly
            in a country like Nicaragua. Here, in Nicaragua's case, we
            have to make some important observations. The data clearly
            reflect that we have had growth in the formal employment
            register. I'm referring to the register of people insured by
            Nicaragua's Social Security Institute.<br>
            <br>
            That growth definitely shows a rise towards having 574,000
            people registered in our Social Security Institute and when
            we look at particular sectors like the Free Trade Zones in
            &#8220;007 we had 90,000 people employed that diminished through
            2008 and recovered slowly through 2009 up to the current
            levels that we have in 2010 and 2011. That gives us an idea,
            a panorama of how the political economy of the government
            has developed the formal employment sector of the economy
            which has meant an increase in the number of registered
            employed.<br>
            <br>
            But that isn't the complete reality of employment in
            Nicaragua. Because if we look at the figures, we can see
            that the agricultural sector in Nicaragua ha had export
            growth of 30% a year. But, when productivity levels have not
            changed greatly, for that export growth to be credible in
            terms of production volumes without increased employment is
            difficult to explain.<br>
            <br>
            What's happening is that the employment generated by that
            agro-export model which has empowered the productive
            capacity of the agricultural sector&nbsp; is employment that
            will not necessarily show up in the Social Security data and
            it is a challenge that we Nicaraguans have in that
            agricultural sector where it is obvious that there has been
            an increase in employment but which is not reflected in the
            formal employment numbers registered in the Social Security
            Institute<br>
            <br>
            But without any doubt, the finance for raising meat
            production in Nicaragua, milk production, production of
            black beans, peanuts and all Nicaragua's export drive have a
            direct impact on employment which as I have explained and as
            I insist is clear from the formal employment figures but is
            not reflected in other figures, those of people not
            registered and it is obvious that there has also been an
            increase in the number of people in Nicaragua's labour
            force.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : Can you comment on opposition attacks against ALBA in
            Nicaragua&nbsp; in terms of regulation on the use of
            resources and of welfare-ism?<br>
            <br>
            Here the important thing for the Central Bank&nbsp; has been
            the concrete pressure for accountability by any government
            to its citizens and I think it is not particularly difficult
            for people to access our Central Bank web site where they
            can find all the information relating to ALBA's development
            cooperation. Here we have to remember that Nicaragua has an
            agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the
            policeman of the world's economy and that in agreement with
            the IMF we here in Nicaragua have said there is no
            difficulty at all in making public the use of ALBA's
            development cooperation and that didn't happen before. In
            the last two years we have been giving twice-yearly reports
            on the ALBA resources and how they are used.<br>
            <br>
            Nor can we in Nicaragua's government of reconciliation and
            national unity forget that control mechanisms exist in
            Venezuela as well. ALBA and its presence in Nicaragua are
            not&nbsp; a matter of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discretionality for
            Nicaraguan officials. They are subject to the relevant
            Venezuelan law. In the case of Nicaraguan bodies
            participating in economically productive programmes or
            social-productive programmes and social programmes funded by
            ALBA in Nicaragua, they are obliged to make reports of their
            financial situation and balance sheets. Furthermore, the
            latest commitment&nbsp; with the IMF is for Nicaraguan
            cooperatives, and people know which organization that points
            to, to publish in the best form possible, periodic and
            thorough current financial information on those bodies.<br>
            <br>
            We are going to implement a rule via the relevant body, in
            this case the Institute that regulates Nicaragua's
            cooperatives, whereby the financial results, the income and
            expenditure accounts and the balance sheet of the
            cooperatives have to be made public for citizens to review.
            And that has to be done because we are working with a
            project that is neither a donation nor a private foundation
            doling out resources to the most needy sectors in Nicaragua.
            A policy of assistance does exist, but that is different.<br>
            <br>
            One is talking there about looking after those who require
            help immediately, either from the government or from those
            ALBA projects. I'm talking about programmes for children,
            about mother and infant programmes, which are clearly
            assistencial to the extent that they address realities in
            this country, in our society. So the State via its main
            instrument, the National Budget, or with programmes of this
            kind, promotes them to help the most needy.<br>
            <br>
            But the general concept as to the use or the objective of
            the resources made available by ALBA or by Nicaraguan social
            and productive programmes and projects is to turn those who
            receive that funding into economic agents. It's not a
            question of giving people a chicken or a cow or a pig to eat
            so that rural people have food.<br>
            <br>
            It is a programme fundamentally aimed at women in Nicaragua,
            many single mothers and at the rural family sector who
            thanks to their particular experience and the
            characteristics of rural families in Nicaragua can develop
            production sufficient to meet their own consumption by means
            of a Productive Bonus promoted by the government. They can
            turn into economic agents developing pork and egg production
            and the sale of milk from the cows they receive.<br>
            <br>
            The concept is not, &#8220;take this so you have something to eat&#8221;
            but rather &#8220; take this so you can produce and eat in a way
            that's self-sufficient&#8221;. But in no way can it be said that
            this government of reconciliation and national unity has an
            assistencialist policy in general. There is a policy of
            support for the most needy. That's obvious and clear. But
            generally, the policy is to integrate broad sectors of
            Nicaraguan society, above all in rural areas, as economic
            agents. And the experience we have had tells us that this is
            yielding results.<br>
            <br>
            In some ways it has been successful and in other ways
            obviously there have been failures because we cannot say
            that every project promoted by a government, whether or not
            it's a revolutionary government, is going to be successful.
            Any government is going to have successful policies and also
            policies that fail. And within those same successful
            projects, some sectors will work successfully and others
            won't. They are policies that through the life of their
            implementation are overcome difficulties and correct
            mistakes. These projects are formulated and reformulated
            along the way so as to achieve the most strategic objectives
            which in this case is the incorporation into productive life
            of Nicaraguan women and rural families.<br>
            <br>
            I think it is vital to reduce poverty levels. This
            government of reconciliation and national unity does not
            believe just doling things out is going to end poverty in
            Nicaragua. It is handing over the tools that will allow the
            most vulnerable sectors and I should use the term excluded,
            because they were not born into that position of
            vulnerability of their own free will. The system excluded
            them. A model was developed that did not allow them to
            integrate as economc agents which is what we are interested
            in along with a vision of sustainability.<br>
            <br>
            TcS&nbsp; How basic is it for ALBA's development to achieve
            a redistribution of wealth and resources?<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Antenor Rosales : I understand the ALBA projects as projects
            that generate wealth, that generate production so as to
            allow the integration of people who were not always given
            the chance to be productive for lack of technical
            assistance, for lack of land, or through not having secure
            title to their property or for lack of credit. Because we
            have to say that a high percentage of coffee production in
            Nicaragua for example, one of the most sensitive export
            products is in the hands of small and medium sized
            producers. And from where do the big cattle wholesalers get
            their bullocks to fatten? Is it not from the small and
            medium sized cattle farmers?<br>
            <br>
            So here we are faced with projects that are aimed at
            generating wealth, but not a concentrated wealth but rather
            a wealth spread out among the greatest possible number of
            actors in a given sector, agriculture for example, helping
            them realize their productive capacity with the precise
            aim&nbsp; of achieving a redistribution of the national
            wealth but not by stripping it away from someone to give to
            someone else. Rather by from the outset ensuring that
            everyone, or as many people as possible are productive and
            in that way via paying our taxes, by good use of contracts,
            by creating employment we can develop a Nicaragua in which
            the levels of poverty and extreme poverty are reduced as far
            as possible.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : What vision do you and your colleagues have for ALBA's
            development in the region, for example the role of the Bank
            of ALBA?<br>
            <br>
            Antenor Rosales: The first thing to say on that is that the
            ALBA Bank is one example of ALBA's move towards creating a
            financial architecture responsive to the needs of the Latin
            American peoples. The Bank of ALBA is one component but
            other components exist like the Single System for Regional
            Compensation Payments and also the well known but little
            explained supranational companies which are all parts of
            ALBA alongside, of course, the Bank of ALBA.<br>
            <br>
            Because we have a supranational company called
            ALBA-Medicines which will buy medicines at the better
            prices&nbsp; that could the individual countries that make
            up ALBA. We have a supranational company&nbsp; linked to
            transport, air transport as well as sea transport. These are
            ideas that ALBA has steadily been turning into reality.<br>
            <br>
            The Bank of ALBA was one of the first expressions of this
            new financial architecture that LABA has tried to develop,
            but let's focus if you will on some of the projects. We fund
            two types of projects via the Bank of ALBA. Projects with
            loans and projects with grants. Among the projects funded by
            loans you have ALBA-Medicines and another supranational
            company, ALBA-Education. Here the Bank of ALBA funds
            projects with grants. But other supranational companies we
            fund with loans, for example, ALBA-Telecommunications,
            ALBA-Environment, ALBA-Transport, ALBA-Energy.<br>
            <br>
            What level will these projects and this financial
            architecture that ALBA seeks to develop reach? It's going to
            develop to the extent that ALBA itself develops and
            consolidates. If ALBA's development remains weak then that
            architecture is not going to reach the specifications
            required. If ALBA grows stronger you can rest assured that
            ALBA's financial expression will make qualitative leaps
            because while it's true ALBA has its bank, but is there an
            ALBA-Insurer?<br>
            <br>
            We need an insurance company because with the creation of
            supranational companies you're going to have trade, you're
            going to have a merchant marine, you're going to have
            markets moving goods from one country to another. But who is
            going to insure that merchandise on the move? The existing
            insurance companies? <br>
            <br>
            In that case one would be working with a mixed financial
            architecture and obviously ALBA does not want that. So we
            have some way to go still. For example, the ratings
            agencies. ALBA needs ratings agencies, insurance companies,
            the Bank, which exists. ALBA needs logistical capacity for
            transport.<br>
            <br>
            I should highlight here that without the ALBA Bank,
            developing these projects would be impossible. And that Bank
            is working and is making progress. It is present in all the
            ALBA countries. Cuba already has a branch open. In Nicaragua
            we do not, yet. We have to wait for a decision by the
            Ministerial Council of the ALBA Bank. <br>
            <br>
            Three months ago the Ministerial Council met and I was able
            to take part to evaluate the balance sheet for 2010 and the
            budget for 2011. In any case, the Bank of ALBA is the way
            ALBA is going to develop a new international financial
            architecture and right now is working to finance projects
            with loans and with grants and to develop the supranational
            companies<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            TcS : Certain sectors of Nicaragua's left wing political
            opposition have criticised the government for depending too
            much on the IMF. Can you comment?<br>
            <br>
            Antenor Rosales : Firstly, you should not forget that we are
            members of the International Monetary Fund. In our case we
            have a programme with the Fund. The United States is also a
            member of the Fund, but does not have a programme with the
            FUND. We are part of the International Monetary Fund and we
            are in the Board of the Fund with a shared place along with
            Mexico, Spain, Venezuela and Central America. <br>
            <br>
            We are part of the Fund. We demand more participation in the
            Fund. That is why we backed the candidacy of the President
            of Mexico's Central Bank, Agust&iacute;n Carstens to be
            Director General of the Fund. Because within the Fund we
            demand greater weight for the economies that were not
            founders of the Fund when it began.<br>
            <br>
            We have a programme with the Fund because we are convinced
            that it is important for the world in general to know that
            Nicaragua has truly responsible policies at a macroeconomic
            and monetary level, and in terms of our exchange rate and
            taxation. We should not forget that when we undertook a
            programme with the Fund it was because we had worked out a
            financial and economic programme for Nicaragua. And we put
            it to them, &#8220;This is what we have come up with now let's
            discuss a programme...&#8221; and at the time it was called a
            programme to Service Growth and Poverty Reduction and now is
            called a Programme to Service Broader Credit.<br>
            <br>
            And what this programme with the International Monetary
            Funds means is that investors do not have to engage in
            extensive research to discover how Nicaragua behaves in
            terms of financial adn monetary stability and it summarizes
            what the international financial and economic community are
            saying about Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            And what do they say about Nicaragua? They say Nicaragua has
            a prudent tax policy, that we are a society, a State, a
            government which while clearly favouring disadvantaged
            sectors of its society is well aware that investment, and
            national productive capacity is all that will permit
            employment growth, income redistribution and poverty
            reduction.<br>
            <br>
            So it is not that we are pet pupils of the International
            Monetary Fund. What we are is a government committed to the
            economic growth necessary as a basic and indispensable
            requirement necessary for Nicaragua to make progress not
            just in terms of democracy, freedom and respect for human
            rights. But also to make progress in terms of material
            prosperity which is impossibnle to achieve with high levels
            of poverty.<br>
