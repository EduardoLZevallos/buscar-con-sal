https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:134467-una-pandemia-historica-mas-virulenta-que-un-tumor-cancerigeno-</em></p>

<p>There are multiple ways of seeing, understanding, analyzing and interpreting the anti-Sandinista Opposition that today has become a mercenary opposition (paid by a foreign power), parasitic, treacherous, political pimp, provincial, parochial (eaters of idolatrous Roman priests), ignorant, fanatical and totally dependent on the United States of America.</p>

<p><br />
Historically, they have defined themselves as "Historical Parallels" since the time of Frutos Chamorro in 1854, the original patriarch of the Chamorro dynasty, which accounted for 7 Presidents of the same oligarch lineage and who at the present time tried to launch 3 blood cousins of the same bloody lineage, only surpassed by the other brutal parallel, the Somoza dynasty.</p>

<p>These "Historical Parallels", Liberals-Conservatives, also known as "Timbucos and Calandracas", took turns at bat for more than 150 years to engorge themselves with the resources of the state of the Nicaraguan nation.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Pellas, and a couple of banking families, the 2 richest families in Nicaragua have been the Somoza and the Chamorro, who have held a monopoly on political power in Nicaragua, for almost 8 generations.</p>

<p>Sociologically, the Nicaraguan opposition developed into 2 groups: the white Oligarchy, gravitating mainly around the dynastic lineage of the Chamorro family; and the Chapiolla Bourgeoisie, which had its maximum historical expression with the emergence and consolidation of the Somocista tyranny.</p>

<p>The founder of the Somocista tyranny, Anastasio Somoza García, (grandson of Bernabé Somoza, the famous rustler of Rivas), was despised by the blue blood Oligarchy of Granada's cross street, and reluctantly accepted by the other blue blood side of León, because of his marriage to Salvadora Debayle, sister of the Dario muse, Margarita; the one in the poem, "Margarita the sea is beautiful", immortalized by the prince of Castilian letters, the great Rubén, author of the monumental "Ode to Roosevelt", an awesome prophetical projection.</p>

<p>The triumph of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, erupted with telluric power, like a giant contact bomb; the greatest historical expression of united workers and producers, structured and advanced by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, FSLN. “Those who were not invited, arrived” as Lazlo Pataki, the Somocista deer of Israeli origin, would say.</p>

<p>With the irruption of the historical force of the poor, the "eat-when-you-can", the dirty-necks, the barefooted, "the wretched of the earth", of Franz Fanón, the "reeking", of whom Sandino had prophesied that "only their organized strength will achieve victory”, both U.S. imperialism and its local puppets, oligarchs and bourgeois, shouted to heaven and said “save us Lord, we are perishing” to quote the first theologian of the Liberation of Nicaragua, Uriel Molina Oliu.</p>

<p>Terror and panic seized the upper echelons of power in Washington, the capital of the empire. The final offensive of the Sandinista guerrillas, those “golden egg boys” who came down from the hills, as a peasant from Tisma said; became the most observed, studied and analyzed guerrilla of national liberation of modern times, by the strategists of the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA and other experts and ideologues of the "think tanks" of Yankee imperialism.</p>

<p>The ruling plutocracy concluded that the nascent Sandinista Popular Revolution had to be stopped and crushed from its infancy. No, ladies and gentlemen, it was not Ronald Reagan who started the covert operations against Nicaragua. It was none other than James Earl Carter, who ordered the CIA to initiate destabilization operations against the Infant (girl) Revolution.<br />
North American imperialism then unleashed all its fury, all its cruelty, all its hatred against the second government, after Cuba, of workers and peasants that were victorious in Latin America, practically under the very nose of "the blond beast from the north" as it was characterized by the most illustrious of all Nicaraguans, Augusto C. Sandino.</p>

<p>The most powerful government on planet earth, in all of human history, sentenced us to death and declared war on us. The CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, then organized the largest wage-earning peasant guerrilla in the world, known as “La Contra.”</p>

<p>The Nicaraguan people and government resisted the cruel onslaught of the Contra war. 38,000 Nicaraguans lost their lives, the United States dynamited bridges in agricultural production areas, murdered hundreds of literacy teachers, placed water mines in our ports to prevent commercial ships from docking, imposed a financial, economic and commercial embargo against exports and banking operations of multilateral organizations.</p>

<p>As Somoza “economists” tend to boast, the Nicaraguan economy regressed to 1943 levels, though not to the Stone Age, as they promised to do with Salvador Allende's Chile.</p>

<p>The Nicaraguan people, spearheaded by the FSLN and its government, led by the historical Comandante, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, that 32-year-old man who triumphantly entered the plaza on 20TH July, 1979, defeated foreign aggression; first in the legal field, with the historic judicial victory when the International Court of Justice in The Hague tried and sentenced the United States for its illegal aggression against Nicaragua, and then, we defeated the Contras in the mountains.</p>

<p>Later, although we lost an election, but not the war, the Contras were forced to disarm after the victory of Violeta Chamorro in 1990. Here is the greatest betrayal to the Nicaraguan people, carried out by the Sandinista caucus in the National Assembly, controlled by forces of the now defunct National Opposition Union.<br />
<br />
The entire Sandinista bench, equivalent to all the red and black MP´s, headed by Sergio Ramírez Mercado, the man who has done more damage to Nicaragua than Somocista Colonel Enrique Bermúdez Varela, commander of the Contra, went over to the Somocista-Chamorrista side, with suitcase and all.</p>

<p>Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra was left alone, or rather they left him alone, by his former comrades in youthful adventures and heroic revolutionary deeds. But he wasn't really alone.</p>

<p>All the poor people of Nicaragua, the farmhands, farm laborers, coffee and cotton cutters, domestic workers, street vendors, market tenants, honoring Sandino's lapidary phrase, "only the workers and peasants will go to the end; only their organized force will achieve victory”, they did not abandon the Sandinista Comandante.</p>

<p>Nor did Daniel leave the people. During that journey in the desert, where the people together with the FSLN crossed the Niagara on a stool, during the ferocious neoliberal offensive of the 3 puppet governments Lacayo-Arnoldo-Churruco-Somocistas, Daniel travelled the entire country.</p>

<p>There was no region, there was no hamlet, there was no neighborhood where the Comandante did not make an appearance to accompany the people to resist the gale.</p>

<p>“Governing without wars, without blockades, without sabotaging production, without mining ports, without blowing up bridges, without supersonic flights of the 'black bird', the SR-71 spy plane, without attacks with CIA piranha boats, with all the generosity of the world community and international banking; after they promised heaven and earth, the self-proclaimed democratic sectors rode the bull for 17 years and failed,” said an editorial commentary from Los Angeles, California, newspaper La Opinión, on 5TH July, 2008.</p>

<p>The people of Nicaragua, the people who if they don't work they don't eat, accompanied by Daniel, faced and suffered electoral defeat, after electoral defeat, with horrendous frauds, without the OAS consenting to convene any session of the Permanent Council, to send an investigative commission.</p>

<p>The frauds were as open as they were brazen. During the election that Arnoldo Alemán “won,” at about 9:00 PM at night, electricity suddenly went out at the liberal-controlled National Computer Center, which was revealingly located in the BANIC Center.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, electricity came back on and strangely, who was in the building was none other than the Ambassador of the United States, the Cuban-American Lino Gutiérrez. No one knows what whistle that Ambassador blew in there, since it was not his place to be in there at all.</p>

<p>The already marked electoral ballots appeared thrown in the storm drains of the capital. For the elections that Alemán “won”, the head of the Carter Center observer delegation, Oscar Arias himself, told Comandante Ortega that the fraud against him was so obvious that in Costa Rica, it would have been enough to annul and repeat the election, but that he (Arias) recommended Daniel, not to complain because they simply were not going to believe him.</p>

<p>In 2001, for the elections that Enrique Bolaños Geyer won, President Arnoldo Alemán ordered the Army to take out the tanks to patrol the streets on election day, when there was not a single indication of military aggression that warranted such an obviously unnecessary display of force.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the worldwide news scandal that would have been created if Comandante Ortega ever took out the tanks to patrol Managua on election day?</p>

<p>First, the news would appear on the front page of all the major newspapers in the entire world. Second, all the big television networks would broadcast the news; and third, the OAS would immediately call an emergency meeting to consider this brutal, unnecessary and bizarre militarization of the elections.<br />
<br />
But when Alemán did that, militarizing the country with tanks, no one was alarmed by this brutal intimidation of voters.</p>

<p>All this has been forgotten by the oblivious anti-Sandinista opposition. They forgot that the FSLN swallowed 3 monstrous electoral frauds and accepted their "defeat" because peace and stability for Nicaraguans came first.</p>

<p>First there was the tranquility of the motherland and because Daniel knew very well, that he would not be listened to, not by the OAS, not by the UN, not by anyone.<br />
<br />
During all those 3 elections (Chamorro, Alemán, Bolaños), the 3 governments at the service of a foreign power, not only dismantled all the main social victories of the impoverished majorities that had benefited from the Agrarian Reform and with housing, but also accelerated unemployment, poverty and hunger, among more than 200,000 Nicaraguan families.<br />
<br />
The government of Mrs. Violeta gave back to their “legitimate” owners, the former Somocista national guards, the thousands of homes that were confiscated, carrying out genocidal, cruel and inhumane evictions of elderly mothers of heroes and martyrs, as well as widows and orphans of Sandinista combatants.</p>

<p>She carried out massive layoffs to make way for the “democratic” hurricane of the liberal-conservative historical parallels, that were recovering their privileges, throwing more than 200,000 Nicaraguans into unemployment and hunger, dismissed from the government and the army, under the euphemism of “compacting.”</p>

<p>In all state institutions, ministries and municipalities that they won, they made a total and absolute sweep of all the Sandinista employees. They invented an administrative axiom according to which all government positions were "trusted" positions.</p>

<p>In that trusted sweep they fired drivers, gardeners and cleaning ladies without contemplation. Only beautiful young receptionists or secretaries who were willing to “lend it” escaped in order to keep their jobs.</p>

<p>The hatred, the viciousness, the pathological obsession and the sick fury against everything that even smelled of Sandinismo, extended beyond the limits of the government, the police and the army. As an example I learned of an anecdote that was told to me by a teacher at the Rigoberto López Pérez Secondary School, known before as the 1ST of February School.</p>

<p>The new director of the Rigoberto López Pérez institute, appointed after Doña Violeta took office, was a furious Somocista and outright anti-Sandinista. One morning, when a Coca Cola truck arrived to drop off soft drinks and remove the empty bottles, the director of the Rigoberto institute saw a worker carrying the boxes of soft drinks, who was wearing a cap that said "Long live Daniel."<br />
<br />
He made a frenzy and filled with fury, she went to her office, called the manager of Coca Cola and loudly demanded that she did not want to see that worker with the "Long live Daniel" cap, arrive again in the trucks of Coca Cola. My friend who told me about this incident says that the humble worker in the cap never returned in the Coca Cola trucks. This is how the Somocista guards hate and this is how all the anti-Sandinistas hate, and that is what they call “democracy”.</p>

<p>There is a popular saying: "the one who blinks loses". For 3 consecutive periods, the self-named "democratic sectors" had won. All the anti-Sandinista tendencies had been united during these 3 presidential elections.</p>

<p>But in the year 2006, they blinked. For the first time and due to internal jealousy and protagonism, the "democratic sectors" divided and ran with two candidates, José Rizo Castellón for the Alemán tendency and Eduardo Montealegre Rivas, for his own tendency "Let’s go with Eduardo."</p>

<p>It was not necessary to have graduated from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government to be able to predict that the candidates would lose to the FSLN candidate, Daniel Ortega Saavedra. In fact, they lost and the FSLN won the Sandinista victory, which they could not question, since it took them by surprise.</p>

<p>The return to power of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in 2007 meant a return of hope for the historically marginalized. It meant a second 19TH OF July, a new "festival for the liberation of the oppressed" that the Bible speaks about.</p>

<p>Joy spread like wildfire between the poverty of the humble neighborhoods of Managua and the valleys and ravines of Nicaraguan agriculture.</p>

<p>The same day Comandante Ortega took office, his first act of government was to sign the Oil Agreement with Venezuela, which, due to the political clumsiness of the anti-Sandinistas, ended up in a Private Emporium that widely benefited those most in need.</p>

<p>Those close to President Ortega distributed thousands, if not millions of sheets of zinc throughout the national territory and all granted by a private organization, because the anti-Sandinista harassment decided it be so.</p>

<p>Although the oil protocol with Venezuela was exactly the same as the one President Hugo Chávez offered to President Bolaños, and that he rejected on Colin Powell's orders, the opposition believed that it was a gift from the Venezuelan government to the government of Daniel Ortega and that it was steeped in corruption from beginning to end.</p>

<p>In reality, it was a commercial agreement between Petróleos de Venezuela, SA and ALBANISA, with enormous credit advantages for Nicaragua and a wide margin of discretion for the partner receiving the oil. This allowed a space for commercialization, which, without violating absolutely any Nicaraguan law, could be carried out without violating any of the terms of the oil protocol.</p>

<p>What the "Sir I oppose" of the always clueless anti-Sandinista opposition never say, is that the enormous credit advantages and wide margin of discretion were only possible within certain parameters and conditions. The first was that the extensive credit facilities would only be effective if the price of oil was above $60 a barrel.</p>

<p>If the price of oil fell below 60 dollars a barrel, then what the opposition has called "Venezuelan cooperation" was simply automatically eliminated and other conditions came into operation, the main one being that everything would be negotiated strictly in accordance with the free market laws.</p>

<p>Although complete information on these operations is quite limited, due to the culture of secrecy managed by some intermediate-level party cadres, some public calculations are used, that place the amount of the oil bill between 500 and 700 million dollars a year.</p>

<p>Of that annual oil invoice, the agreement required 50% of the invoice to be paid in cash for shipment received within a period of 90 days. The remaining 50% of the oil debt was converted, according to the terms of the oil agreement, misnamed "Venezuelan cooperation" by the anti-Sandinista opposition, into an automatic loan, payable over 25 years, with 2% interest and a grace period of 2 years.<br />
<br />
The Gordian knot for the anti-Sandinista opposition is in that other 50%, since ALBANISA sold 100% of the gasoline to national private distributors for cash. ALBANISA received in full, the cash of that other 50% in addition to the initial 50% that was liquidated to Venezuela.</p>

<p>ALBANISA had a 2 year grace period to start paying the 50% owed to Venezuela, in a 25 year term. The protocol, as was done with all countries with similar agreements, gave wide discretion to beneficiary countries.</p>

<p>All this floating mass of circulating money allowed ALBANISA, not only to obtain profits from its sale to local private distributors, but also to carry out commercial operations at its total discretion.</p>

<p>On 3rd November, 2009, at the height of the ALBANISA oil boom, the National Assembly, still controlled by the opposition, decided, according to them, to give the fatal "thrust" to the pathologically hated "Venezuelan cooperation" and approved to totally separate the Nicaraguan state of any dirty game between Ortega and PDVSA of Venezuela (Assembly ignores debt with Venezuela, LA PRENSA, 3RD November, 2009).</p>

<p>Of course, a whole parliamentary resolution, totally separating the Nicaraguan state from the businesses of what would later be known as ALBANISA and PDVSA, did not prevent them from continuing to hold a private company accountable, one which because of the above, they had absolutely no right to hold accountable, precisely because it is private and because out of pure whim and cheap politicking, the very clumsy opposition, so themselves decided it to be.</p>

<p>ALBANISA's coffers were overflowing not only with gasoline, but also with millions of dollars. In difficult situations, the Nicaraguan state requested and obtained financial loans from ALBANISA, which only served to further infuriate the frustrated anti-Sandinista “angoras”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ortega handed out gas stoves, food, toys, and sheets of zinc to all the neighborhoods of Managua and other cities, with the profits from the sale of gasoline that allowed him not only to pay the monthly installments to PDVSA on time, but to comfortably enjoy an impressive surplus from the cash sales of the gasoline acquired by ALBANISA.</p>

<p>A so-called left-wing economist, who discredits his university diploma as an economist by not "factoring" US aggression into his economic calculations, Enrique Sáenz, continues to rack his brains, trying to prove the improbable, that Ortega "stole" the misnamed Venezuelan cooperation.</p>

<p>In his calculations, Sáenz tries to untie the "Gordian knot" of Ortega's companies, making use of, and interpreting in his own way, certified reports from international accounting firms that rather, endorse with their signature, the handling of funds of the discretionary profits from Venezuelan cooperation, which could have been property of the state since the time of Bolaños, but it was not like that, thanks to the "political imbecility" of the clumsy and fanatical anti-Sandinista opposition.</p>

<p>The political opposition continues fanatically, ridiculously and bitterly repeating that Daniel Ortega is a thief and that he stole "Venezuelan cooperation", but the "dean" of neo-Somocista economists, Enrique Sáenz, has not yet presented any single, clear, credible and convincing proof that supports such a bizarre statement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that 2 year grace window, totally legal, plus the profits produced by the sale of gasoline to private gasoline distributors, at market price, generated such a degree of profit that now there are several television channels that are administered by the sons of President Ortega.</p>

<p>The profits from the sale of gasoline to private distributors constitute a private transaction between individuals, whose capital gains do not violate any law of the Republic, nor are they theft of the people's taxes, which is another totally independent thing, nor do they violate the terms of the oil protocol, nor do they violate Venezuelan laws.</p>

<p>Although the "economist" of yore never tires of inventing and "interpreting" in his own way, the Central Bank's own numbers, aiming to slander the government and President Ortega. This so called economist has not yet been able to reliably prove any of his statements, resorting only to "insinuations" and "suspicions" for which it is not necessary to go to the university to produce them, it is enough to start washing other people's clothes in a Managua laundry, to end the dignity of anyone. That's right Mr. Sáenz, that's how low you have fallen.</p>

<p>I worked for the American judicial system for 25 years in the state of California and although I am not an economist, I have carefully studied all the nonsense of Mr. Enrique Sáenz and I am fully and completely certain that if Mr. Sáenz had to prove those same accusations before a North American Civil Court, using exactly the same data and “innuendo” strategies, not only would he fail, but he would totally ridicule himself.</p>

<p>The same year that President Ortega began his first presidential term, after the neoliberal storm of 3 apocalyptic horsemen, the world experienced a global recession, which began in the United States, logically affecting Nicaragua. As the popular saying goes “when the United States sneezes, Latin America gets a fever.”</p>

<p>Obviously, that world recession affected Nicaragua, although Comandante Téllez said that this was just an excuse of Ortega´s, "what recession or anything." However, the world came out of the recession and the world economy recovered and Nicaragua began to grow.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of President Ortega and with the support of the ALBA countries, the Nicaraguan economy experienced growth rarely seen in the last 50 years. By 2017, the Nicaraguan economy grew more than that of Costa Rica, according to the portal "CentralAmericaData.com", specialized in business information.</p>

<p>While Nicaragua's GDP grew 5.2% in 2017, Costa Rica's GDP, although much larger than ours, only grew 3.2%. We ranked as the fastest growing country in Central America, except for Panama, which receives billions of dollars in tolls for the use of the interoceanic canal.</p>

<p>By 2017, the economy was growing faster than foam, Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) began to grow, small businesses expanded, unemployment began to subside; The Nicaraguan economy was undergoing a strong expansion that had no rival in Central America.<br />
<br />
And to the tears of the enemies of the motherland, all of the above was accompanied by abundant benefits for the poorest.</p>

<p>Anger, panic and despair seized the Nicaraguan opposition. Ortega had to be stopped at all costs. If the “incipient dictator's” economy was allowed to continue to flourish like a Garden of Eden, they, the wage earners of a foreign power, would have absolutely no chance of winning the next presidential election.</p>

<p>Even the International Monetary Fund closed its offices in Managua and withdrew its mission as financial advisers, because it was no longer necessary to be a "nanny" monitoring the management of the economy by the Sandinista government, given the excellent qualifications of the "best student of the IMF "the bachelor" Daniel Ortega Saavedra, as the abovementioned Sáenz repeated verbatim with cheap sarcasm.</p>

<p>Making a decision, inspired more by the liver than by the brain, pathologically hating the enormous economic, financial and commercial advances of the Ortega government, the mercenaries and political parasites of the same power that assassinated Sandino and imposed the Somocista tyranny on us; the anti-Sandinistas mounted a swine rage and unleashed all their neo-Somocista hatred with the mercenary coup uprising of April 2018.</p>

<p>The economy had to be destroyed, the people had to be starved to death, it had to be shown that “democracy” (a form of government dictated by the Yankees) was more important than the economy.</p>

<p>An employee of a Colombian consortium, mockingly shouted with more hate than intelligence, “the economy, the economy; that is the price that Nicaraguans have to pay to achieve democracy,” when the Sandinista delegates denounced that they were harming the economy and therefore the people.</p>

<p>Like barbaric hordes, more enraged than Attila's Huns, the Somocista coup mercenaries, nicknamed the “self-convened”, set out to destroy everything in their path.</p>

<p>They captured thousands of unsuspecting boys from the Sandinista Youth, stripped them naked and tied them to posts in the middle of a public thoroughfare. Making fun of the flag, they daubed the nudes with blue and white paint, while they yelled at them like guard torturers, "This is the color of your flag, son of a bitch."</p>

<p>It wasn't the government or the FSLN militants that burned buses, it was them; It wasn't the Sandinista Youth, nor members of the Sandinista party who burned down town halls, it was them, the leaders of the coup; It wasn't the revolutionaries or the police who looted supermarkets, it was the employees of the United States embassy in Managua; It was not the Sandinistas who raised roadblocks in the streets, main arteries and highways and paralyzed the entire country, it was the leaders of the coup at the service of a foreign power.</p>

<p>Under threat, they forced the big businessmen of the COSEP to close their businesses and tamed them “by force.” But they could not subdue the tenants of the Oriental Market and other markets whom they also threatened, but far from being intimidated, they organized, armed themselves and expelled them from the markets. If commercial activity decreased in the markets, it was because the roadblocks made it almost impossible to reach them.<br />
<br />
According to the economist from the prestigious American Yale University, Néstor Avendaño, the failed coup resulted in the destruction of 200,000 formal jobs (INSS enrolled) and 300,000 informal jobs (self-employed-workers), for a total of 500 thousand jobs that disappeared in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>The leaders of the coup continue to boast that the economy went back 5 years. That unemployment increased, that poverty grew, and finally that migration to the northern power has lately skyrocketed.</p>

<p>But they cynically and shamelessly say that they did nothing and that everything was the sole and exclusive fault of the government for its "brutal repression," so brutal that they forget to factor in the 22 police officers killed by the coup leaders with rubber bands and the more than 200 deaths, most of whom were Sandinistas.</p>

<p>To the savage blow to the economy inflicted by the unpopular uprising, financed entirely by USAID through its embassy in Managua and channeled through the “Chamorro Inc.” “Laundry””, we must add the combined effect of 3 brutal hurricanes that hit the Caribbean Coast, and the Pandemic of global proportions, followed by the resulting inflation, also of a global nature, completely out of the control of the Nicaraguan government.</p>

<p>Even fully knowing all of the above, the petty outlaws, mercenaries paid by the US government, did not give up. Seeing that the Nicaraguan people and government, with great effort and sacrifice, was moving ahead, they went on their knees to implore the whip of the Yankee executioner and requested sanctions against the Nicaraguan government and its main officials.</p>

<p>Currently world inflation is a scourge that plagues the entire world. Its damage is such that it has already caused the fall of several governments in Europe and the loss of Democratic control of the House of Representatives in the United States.</p>

<p>With the combined and cumulative effect of the coup, the pandemic, hurricanes, inflation, and imperialist sanctions, migration to the United States has skyrocketed, making the enemies of the Nicaraguan popular classes, jump for joy.</p>

<p>Confirming that it is not a loyal or patriotic opposition, or that they simply have another way of governing or that they simply have another point of view, the anti-Sandinista opposition showed signs of infinite viciousness and cruelty that go beyond political differences, to become pathological aberrations of a psychiatric nature.</p>

<p>What has been said above is confirmed just by listening to the bitterness with which they complain when the workers expelled from Nicaragua due to the economic crisis caused by the Somoza mercenaries, are sending remittances to their families which will exceed 3,000 million dollars this year.</p>

<p>Somocista mercenary coup leaders are up in flames that those 3,000 million dollars, upon entering the economy of the markets and the popular basket, are going to sustain the rice and beans economy (basic grains, markets and remittances) of the popular classes, but also they help to expand the “tax floor” (increase the tax base for the commercial activity generated by remittances) of the Nicaraguan government.<br />
<br />
Simultaneously they lament that government taxes will rise with the growth of remittances, thus facilitating greater social investments in Health and Education; the mentally ill opposition rejoices that the sanctions on foreign mining companies will reduce their exports of gold and pay less taxes to the Nicaraguan treasury.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Nicaraguan economy continues to grow despite the undignified and criminal efforts of the opposition to prevent it. The World Bank forecasts the Nicaraguan economy will experience a decrease of 5 to 4% by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Guided by that same 32-year-old boy who triumphantly entered the Revolution Plaza in 1979, we will defeat whatever sanction they think of imposing on us.</p>

<p>In fact, due to the combined and cumulative effect of the coup, the pandemic, hurricanes, inflation and sanctions, unemployment and migration are rising, at which the mercenaries laugh, showing their bloody fangs, which are dripping with blood, the holy blood of the long-suffering, but heroic, Nicaraguan people.<br />
<br />
The Holy Scriptures, when describing the eternal struggle of good and evil, enlighten us with a lapidary sentence by declaring that "the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation" (Exodus 17:16).</p>

<p>And our contemporary history also teaches us that "we will go towards the sun of freedom or towards death and if we die, it doesn't matter, others will follow us", according to Sandino. Which coincides with the words of Tomas: "Even if they die of rage, there will be a Revolution until the end of the centuries."</p>

<p>The Nicaraguan popular classes have absolutely no other alternative than to close ranks with the government of the workers and peasants, with the government of the wretched of the earth, although others have been falling by the wayside, as pointed out by the most illustrious of all Nicaraguans, the general of free men Augusto C. Sandino:</p>

<p>“Because of the character that the fight takes, the weak, the cowards and the pusillanimous, will abandon us; only the workers and peasants will go to the end, only their organized force will achieve victory”.</p>
