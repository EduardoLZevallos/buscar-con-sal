<h3><em><strong>When lies turn into bombs and international silence becomes an accomplice to crime</strong></em></h3>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120927074234-benjamin-netanyahu-bomb-un-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg" width="400" /></p>

<p>Cardboard bombs and deadly powders: lies every decade...... and destruction of every nation. targeted... Their weapons are lies… and their victims are people. This is what we learned from the enemies of humanity, Colin Powell and Netanyahu, because they are masters of lies and forgery, that's why they are stars of the International Nuclear Circus, and if an Oscar should be awarded, it should be shared by Colin Powell and Netanyahu, because they are an example of disgrace and historic shame.<br />
<br />
Netanyahu's phony bomb... and US deadly lies: When the lie becomes politics and the occupation shapes reality. For more than two decades, the Prime Minister of the Israeli occupation, Benjamin Netanyahu, has never stopped shouting at every international forum that Iran is “weeks” away from getting the nuclear bomb. Years of scaremongering, cartoonish drawings and hand-drawn red lines in front of the UN General Assembly, as if humanity had no memory. But here we are, in 2025, and the bomb still doesn't exist because the simple truth is: it never existed. It was invented to justify colonial expansionism.</p>

<p>Netanyahu and his infantile sketches: When the UN becomes a stage for slapstick. No one can forget Netanyahu's appearance before the UN General Assembly in 2012, holding a cartoon bomb and drawing a red line with his hand, as if he were in a third-grade elementary school science class. He said then that Iran was "a few weeks away" from developing a nuclear bomb. Today, more than 10 Israeli years later, the bomb is still lost in Netanyahu's imagination, or perhaps trapped in one of his absurd drawings.</p>

<p>In 2018, Netanyahu re-submitted what he called a "secret nuclear file," purportedly originating from Tehran. The presentation was a cheap propaganda film, full of images and grandiloquence, with no substantive value. Half a ton of documents... and a real catch! When the Israeli intelligence service (Mossad) claimed to have stolen "half a ton" of very top secret documents related to the Iranian nuclear program (2018) in an operation that looked like a cheap spy movie from an unguarded warehouse, it claimed that Mossad agents entered an "abandoned nuclear facility without cameras or sensors" near the Kahrizak high-security prison, as if Iran kept its nuclear secrets in a vegetable stall! In 2020, Netanyahu again claimed that Iran was about to possess the nuclear bomb, as his political era follows a special calendar, where a decade equals a year, and perhaps each minute equals a day.</p>

<p>In 2020 he repeated the same scratched record again: "Iran is close to the bomb.” But more than twenty years later, there is no bomb. There is only a gigantic propaganda arsenal, systematic lies and a Western media apparatus that applauds without question.</p>

<p>2025: The real bombshell is the disinformation campaign... not in Tehran, but in Tel Aviv. Despite the Israeli bombings of Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon, and that the level of uranium enrichment (60%) does not imply the ability to make a bomb. On the other hand, Israel possesses between 75 and more than 200 secret nuclear warheads, and refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or allow international inspections. This contradiction reveals everything: the fear is not of a bomb, but of an independent state capable of deterring hegemony. That is why the ”Iranian bomb" is just an excuse to destroy Iran’s projects of sovereignty and liberation.</p>

<p>With lethal powders and cardboard bombs - That's how the UN is run. The lie about the "weapons of mass destruction” which served as a pretext for invading Iraq has not been forgotten. A nation was occupied, a people was destroyed and more than a million people were killed in the name of a great farce manufactured by the United States, Israel and their Western allies. The United States turned lying into a strategic tool to destroy entire peoples, using the United Nations as a propaganda platform instead of an impartial institution.</p>

<p>In 2003, the then US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, appeared before the UN Security Council in an embarrassing theatrical performance, holding a small tube containing a white powder, claiming that it was irrefutable proof that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The scene was cartoonish; the tube seemed rather to contain like sugar or flour, but it was used to justify a bloody invasion.</p>

<p>Some time later it seems the effect of the forbidden white powder disappeared, and with his mind restored, Powell offered an embarrassing apology saying “I was deceived, and Iraq does not possess a weapon of mass destruction,” and admitting that what he presented was based on false information, calling his speech to the UN a “stain” on his political career. But the damage was already done, a country had been destroyed, more than a million people had been murdered, and all based on an official lie.</p>

<p>The tragedy lies not only in the deception, but in the total absence of accountability. As if the life of peoples were a simple game in which death and existence have no value. The United Nations, instead of being a space for international justice, has become a stage for political action, where lies are presented with primitive stage props and crimes are committed under the guise of “international legitimacy”.</p>

<p>Netanyahu's cartoons legalize crime with lies. From the lie about the Iranian bomb to the false "right to self-defense” bombing children in Gaza, Israel has mastered the art of deception to legitimize its crimes. The Dimona reactor in the Negev Desert, for example, is a real source of radioactive contamination. Studies have shown that the soils in Halhul, Palestine, have radiation levels three times higher than international standards.</p>

<p>In every aggression, lies serve as an excuse to attack hospitals and schools and to assassinate scientists — even those specialized in desalination and energy technology — in an attempt to destroy peoples' capacities for independence.</p>

<p>The West: complicit in the Hollywood crime series of international politics. The United States and Europe, with their security policies and their media, were not victims of Netanyahu's lies, but accomplices in their production and dissemination. Billions spent on espionage have not produced a single real proof of an Iranian military nuclear program. Even the "leaked" documents did not convince the International Atomic Energy Agency itself, which assured that Iran had abandoned any military nuclear activity since 2003.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, any sovereign project in the region is suffocated, while Israel and the West continue to manufacture "nuclear scarecrows” to attack the political, economic and military independence of countries like Iran, Iraq, and who knows what's next.</p>

<p>The real bomb is Israel... and the lie is its own nuclear weapon. What Netanyahu and the West are looking for is not to prevent Iran from building a bomb, but to prevent it from building a truly sovereign capability. Because in the end, the ”bomb" is not uranium, but the lies used as a weapon of political and cultural extermination. Just as the ”Iraqi weapons of mass destruction“ were a lie that destroyed an entire people, the ”Iranian bomb" is another scarecrow to justify a new aggression, and perhaps a future catastrophe.</p>

<p>Today, the world is not facing a threat called Iran, but a system of lies represented by Israel, led by the United States and produced by the West, the cost of which is paid by the peoples of the world.</p>

<p>The only bomb that needs to be defused is not in Tehran, but in Tel Aviv... where lies and fears are fabricated just like bombs, and where security is built on the skulls of the innocent.</p>
