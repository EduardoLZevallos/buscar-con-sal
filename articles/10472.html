<h3><br />
<strong>MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY OF NICARAGUA</strong></h3>

<p><strong>OPENING REMARKS, FAO REGIONAL CONFERENCE FOR LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, 36TH SESSION</strong></p>

<p><strong>Managua, October 19, 2020</strong></p>

<p>Chancellor Denis Moncada Colindres</p>

<p>Excellency Qu Dongyu, Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;</p>

<p>Excellency Khalid Mehboob, Independent Chairman of the FAO Council;</p>

<p>Dear Ministers of Latin America and the Caribbean;</p>

<p>Comrade Edward Centeno, Minister of Agriculture of Nicaragua and President of the 36th FAO Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean;</p>

<p>Excellency Dr. Julio Berdegué, Deputy Director General of FAO and Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean;</p>

<p>Dear and Esteemed Fellow Members of the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity;</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen Representatives of the Member States before the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen Delegates;</p>

<p>Dear Members of the Diplomatic Corps Accredited in Nicaragua and Special Guests;</p>

<p>Dear Comrades of the Press;</p>

<p>1. Receive a cordial welcome from Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of the Republic, and from Comrade Rosario Murillo Zambrana, Vice President. They send their best wishes for the success of this meeting and a speedy recovery of the agricultural sector, the regional economies and from the challenges of 2020.</p>

<p>2. For our part, we have had, since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, a policy of applying health protocols with massive social communication, but without closing the economy or confining the population.</p>

<p>3. 40% of the Nicaraguan population is in the rural areas, the majority in subsistence economy, where daily tasks and the agricultural cycle cannot be deferred. 80% of urban workers are from the informal sector, and most have to work daily to put food on the family table.</p>

<p>4. Most of the private schools opted for virtual classes, but the public schools have remained open for the majority of the student body, who do not have either the computer means or the adequate housing conditions for virtual education.</p>

<p>5. Some creative measures improved the situation. In April and May, 1.2 million vaccinations were given against seasonal influenza and bacterial pneumonia. This has made it possible to reduce the incidence of respiratory illnesses in the country, creating better conditions to face COVID-19. This was made possible by the presence of the Russian company MECHNIKOV and its laboratory in Managua, which has a plant that manufactures influenza vaccines for the entire hemisphere.</p>

<p>6. Now, it turns out that all the countries of the world, even those that had strong confinements, have to learn how to reactivate socially, restoring their economies and simultaneously fighting COVID-19.</p>

<p>7. In the context of the Pandemia, the results for Nicaragua, according to the latest indicators, are as follows:</p>

<p>•    Last week, Nicaragua had 72 new cases of COVID-19 and one death.</p>

<p>•    Nicaragua's exports from January to May, 2020 increased by +14.1%, the highest increase in Latin America and the Caribbean, while the region as a whole experienced a reduction of -26.1% in its exports.</p>

<p>8. Since 2007, progress has been made in the economic and social transformation of Nicaragua, with measures that have favored the poor majorities in both the rural areas and the city. After thirteen years of protagonism of the people, along with the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, we have had significant achievements, some of which have attracted international attention, among them:</p>

<p><strong>THE GENDER GAP</strong></p>

<p>9. In 2007, Nicaragua ranked 90th in the Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while in 2018 and 2020 it ranked 5th, only behind Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland, the Nordic countries famed for their egalitarian levels. This means that Nicaragua ranks first in the matter among developing countries, as well as among the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>10. The Nicaraguan rise is even more meritorious when considering that economically, the relative closing of the gap is concentrated among poor women comrades. This is largely due to two programs that have helped reduce poverty in the rural areas and the city: the Food and Productivity Bonus and Zero Usury Programs.</p>

<p>•    With the Food and Productivity Bonus (Zero Hunger), with which the capacities of around 200 thousand women in the rural sector have been capitalized and strengthened, through the delivery of farm animals, agricultural inputs and tools, as well as training and technical advice for the breeding and development of their animals. As part of the program, they were assisted in the organization of savings and loan groups, but many of them went further and decided, by themselves, to form more than 295 cooperatives, through which they transform and market their products.</p>

<p>•    Through the Zero Usury Program, more than 800,000 urban women, organized into more than 41,000 solidarity groups, have received around 545,000 microcredits at an interest rate of 5% per year, to start or improve their businesses.</p>

<p>11. A third program targeting poor families has also impacted the production, productivity and income of poor families.</p>

<p>12. CRISSOL, is a special program that has provided some 145,000 small family producers with access to seeds and inputs for establishing more than 216,000 manzanas (152,280 hectares) of rice, red beans, corn, sorghum and black beans.</p>

<p><strong>FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY</strong><br />
<br />
13. In addition to the Food and Productivity Bonus and the Zero Usury Programs, we also have social programs related to food and nutrition security.</p>

<p>•    With the “Solidarity beans” program, beans are sold in neighborhoods and communities at prices well below the market price.</p>

<p>•    The “School Lunch” program, by which a nutritious snack is guaranteed to 1.2 million school-age girls and boys throughout the country. In the case of the municipalities of the Dry Corridor, children suffering from stunted growth are offered a Reinforced School Lunch and the necessary support to the family to access improved nutrition.</p>

<p>•    The “Food Packages” program, initiated in 2008, by delivering a package with basic food to families, in which at least one of its members suffers from a severe disability or require permanent care, which prevents them from studying or working.</p>

<p>The “School gardens” program, in addition to having the educational component for school-age girls and boys, allows them to grow food for themselves that will reinforce their school meals.</p>

<p>14. The results of these and other redistributive policies, focused on the most vulnerable sectors, have been very clear and we can see them in:</p>

<p>46% reduction in chronic child malnutrition among children under 5 years of age (from 21.7% in 2006 to 11.1% in 2019) and by 66% among schoolchildren between 6 to 14 years of age (from 27.2% in 2004 to 9.2% in 2018).</p>

<p>Reduction of maternal mortality by 67.8% (from 92.8 in 2006 to 29.9 per 100 thousand live births in 2019) and infant mortality by 60.7% (from 29.0 in 2006 to 11.4 per thousand live births in 2019).</p>

<p><strong>REDUCTION OF POVERTY AND EXTREME POVERTY</strong></p>

<p>15. Other factors that have contributed to reducing poverty and extreme poverty, is the increase of the economy by an average of almost 5% in the 2011-2017 period, with increases in minimum wages above inflation, free and universal health and education, social programs such as school meals, subsidies for public transport, electricity and water, among others.</p>

<p>16. Another important element in reducing poverty and inequality is the delimitation and titling of 23 indigenous and Afro-descendant territories of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua for a total of 37,859 square kilometers.</p>

<p>17. The results verified by household surveys tell us that:</p>

<p>Poverty was reduced from 48.3% in 2005 to 24.9% in 2016.</p>

<p>Extreme poverty was reduced from 17.2% in 2005 to 6.9% in 2016.</p>

<p><strong>ELECTRIFICATION, ROADS, DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION</strong></p>

<p>18. Three fundamental things in the quality of rural life that affect productive capacity are electricity, roads, and potable water and sanitation. Nicaragua has achieved the following results:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Electricity</strong></em><br />
In 2006, only 54% of Nicaraguan families had electricity in their homes, while in 2020, more than 97% of families have electricity in their homes and the goal is to exceed 98% this year.</p>

<p>Nicaragua electrified half the country in 13 years, in the most remote and difficult to access areas.</p>

<p><em><strong>Roads</strong></em><br />
Nicaragua has gone from 2,050 km of paved roads in 2006 to 4,500 km today.</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of Nicaragua, the main city of the Caribbean Coast has a highway that unites her with the rest of the country. There is also better connectivity with Kukra Hill / Pearl Lagoon, Bilwi and Waspam in the Autonomous Regions.</p>

<p>Nicaragua has the best roads in Central America and is one of the 5 countries with the best road infrastructure in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum.</p>

<p><em><strong>Drinking Water and Sanitation</strong></em><br />
The restitution of the right to drinking water and sanitation has been achieved through the addition of 222,446 households to the potable water service and 168,264 households to the sewerage and sanitation service with an investment of US $620.92 million. The results of which have been the following:</p>

<p>Drinking water coverage increased from 65% in 2006 to 91.8% in 2018, with a projection of 95% by 2023.</p>

<p>Coverage of 33% in sanitary sewerage in 2006 to 51% in 2019, with a projection of 70% by 2023.</p>

<p><strong>HEALTH AND EDUCATION</strong><br />
<br />
19. President Daniel Ortega Saavedra announced the restitution of the constitutional right to free and universal health and education on the first day of the current government, on January 10, 2007.</p>

<p><em><strong>Health</strong></em><br />
20. Over the last 13 years, the health system has been strengthened in a comprehensive manner: 18 new hospitals have been built, there is a greater number of trained personnel, 36,649 health workers in 2020, compared to 22,083 in 2006. There are also 6,045 physicians in 2020 compared to 2,715 in 2006. We now have 66 mobile clinics that provide Health services closer to the population.</p>

<p>21. The Family and Community Health Model (MOSAFC) was organized, working in conjunction with a community network that includes nearly 100,000 volunteers and with a total budgetary investment in health greater than US$468.6 million in 2020 compared to US$111.9 million in 2006, a more than fourfold increase, which unknowingly, turned out to be an investment that helped us to face COVID-19.</p>

<p>We have gone from 50 maternity homes in 2006 to 178 in 2020. Now 88% of deliveries are institutional. The results of this coverage are:</p>

<p>Reduction in maternal mortality by 67.8% (from 92.8 in 2006 to 29.9 per 100 thousand live births in 2019) and infant mortality by 60.7% (from 29.0 in 2006 to 11.4 per thousand live births in 2019).</p>

<p><em><strong>Education</strong></em><br />
22. Our Government has extended secondary education to the rural area and primary rescue classes have been held for students lagging behind in their education. Technical, technological and language education has also been prioritized, with an emphasis on coffee, cocoa, animal husbandry, among others. In the Autonomous Regions there is primary education in the mother tongues of the peoples. The overall results have been:</p>

<p>11.4% increase in enrollment</p>

<p>An increase from 90.8% to 95.4% in the approval rate.</p>

<p><strong>CLIMATE CHANGE</strong></p>

<p>23. The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity has also shown that it has a National Policy on Climate Change in favor of nature and mother earth, with principles that focus on economic development, complementarity with disaster risk management, innovation and efficient use of resources, an eco-systemic approach, participation and gender equality, viability and financing of climate measures. Developing the two axes: renewable energy and reforestation. Achieving the following so far:</p>

<p>We went from 26% renewable energy in 2007 to 77% in 2020 and with plans to achieve 90% in 2023.</p>

<p>We currently have US$150 million in forestry plantations.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is committed to reforest 2.8 million hectares of degraded land.</p>

<p>In the Forest Carbon Society, Nicaragua will capture 11 million tons of Greenhouse Gases, which will allow us to access US$55 million dollars in forest incentives.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>24. Nicaragua is a country with the capacity to organize and mobilize to achieve the objectives set out in its public policies. It is also a food producing country. We must continue to encourage this primary sector of the economy, maintaining the aforementioned programs and improving day by day with the help of international organizations such as FAO.</p>

<p>25. Nicaragua is open to technical and financial cooperation, within the framework of our priorities and programs, in order to continue developing our country economically and socially, based on current achievements, advancing towards more victories for the Nicaraguan people.</p>

<p>26. Nicaragua this year has ratified the Agreement on Measures of the Port State in order to prevent, discourage and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; as a sign of the willingness to work together in all the instruments that allow us to grow as a Region.</p>

<p>27. This 36th FAO Regional Conference is held in a global scenario with situations exacerbated by the drastic effects of climate change and the global pandemic, which continue to affect our planet and affect the most vulnerable populations and productive sectors, particularly in our region, where millions of families depend on family farming.</p>

<p>28. These global phenomena affect millions of people, families, and communities that run the risk of being displaced towards the urban peripheries or towards the northern countries of our continent, putting in jeopardy our economic systems, food security, nutrition, peace and social equity.</p>

<p>29. At each FAO Regional Conference, the priority and highly important issues related to food and agriculture, have been debated with the efforts of all the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. We have great challenges to improve productivity, the generation and adoption of accessible technologies, efficiency and quality in production, food safety, financing and access to credit, access to markets, adding value, agribusiness, among others.</p>

<p>30. Dear FAO Executives, friends Ministers, Delegates and members of the Diplomatic Corps:</p>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of Nicaragua appreciates and values the extraordinary mission and humanitarian work of FAO, as well its solidarity toward the most vulnerable peoples of the planet, implementing and strengthening policies and programs for the reduction of poverty, reduction of the food and nutritional insecurity, and the sustainable management of natural resources in the productive, agricultural, fishery and forestry sectors.</p>

<p>31. We recognize its important contributions to Sustainable Development, particularly in reducing Poverty and ensuring Food Security, and its neutrality in favor of global well-being, which has earned it international recognition and respect as a specialized organization that promotes peace, solidarity and equality among countries.</p>

<p>32. These values and qualities put into practice by FAO, in favor of Humanity, motivated Nicaragua to propose to FAO at this Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean, as a candidate to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, inviting each and every participant to support this much deserved and just proposal, in recognition of FAO.</p>

<p>Dear Friends:</p>

<p>33. The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of Nicaragua reaffirms its commitment to continue working together to combat poverty, hunger and malnutrition, in order to transform agriculture and make it sustainable and resilient to climate change. All together and united, we will make a better world possible.</p>

<p>Thank you very much Mr. President!</p>
