<td style="width: 650px; vertical-align: top; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Nicaragua, ALBA and the imperial protection racket</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><br style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">by toni solo</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">For
years it has been more than clear the course US and European Union
policy would take towards the progressive governments of Latin America.
Even in December 2006 it was possible to write "One can only hope Latin
America's Spring endures longer than the one in then Czechoslovakia and
is not frozen stiff by the United States and its European and Pacific
allies manipulating global "free markets" so as to manage economic
downturn as a variation on Clausewitz's "politics by other means"." A
vain hope, it turns out, as recent events in Nicaragua and other Latin
American countries have demonstrated.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
impressive success of the FSLN governments policies in Nicaragua since
January 2007 has been based on two main policies. Firstly, the
government has acted decisively to promote regional integration
processes, especially the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas
(ALBA) led by Cuba and Venezuela. Secondly, it has done this in
parallel with&nbsp; a policy of continuing traditional conventional
cooperation and investment ties with the Western Bloc countries of
North America, Europe and their Pacific allies.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">One
can say much the same about the governments of countries like Bolivia
and Ecuador. In the measure that this mutually complementary policy
model has been consolidated, the influence of the Western Bloc
countries has diminished. So it has been a question of when, not if,
those countries were going to react to slow the decline of their
influence in Latin America.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Those
rich countries have two key objectives in the Central American and
Caribbean region for 2009. First they will seek to stop El Salvador
joining ALBA. El Salvador has presidential elections in March 2009.
Secondly, they will&nbsp; try and ensure the next Honduran government
is less enthusiastic about its membership of ALBA than current
President, Manuel Zelaya. Honduras has presidential elections in
November 2009.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">One
cannot make sense of events in the region without tracing these
elements of the geopolitical context. At stake is the well being and
the right to self-determination of tens of millions of impoverished
people in the Central American countries and in much of the Caribbean.
One has only to look at Haiti to see how deeply down into chaos and
misery the Western Bloc countries will drive a country that fails to do
what they say.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
recent decision of the Bush regime to cut Bolivia out of the Andean
Trade Preference and Drug Eradication Act is just one sign of what is
now taking place. At the other extreme is the criminal blockade against
Cuba. In the middle of that reactionary policy spectrum are the threats
against Ecuador over its review of what it regards as illegitimate
external debt. On another part of the spectrum of the imperialist
country offensive in Latin America is the constant low intensity war
against the government of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
Nicaragua, the imperialist offensive has taken the form of opportunist
destabilization following the humiliating debacle of the US backed
opposition in the country's municipal elections held on November
9th.&nbsp; The US and its European allies have blatantly sided with the
opposition parties in Nicaragua, arguing the recent elections were
fraudulent, a claim they are unable to back up with any plausible
evidence. Even so, the US has used that pretext to suspend one of its
aid programmes. European governments may do likewise despite the
Sandinista's much superior use of aid resources compared to the
previous corrupt government of President Enrique Bolaños, which
European governments propped up without question.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
fact that behaviour by the US and European governments replicates their
behaviour toward the Hamas government of Palestine, When Hamas won
internationally approved Palestinian Authority elections under the
Israeli occupation, the US and Europe moved quickly to strip away
support because they refused to accept the Palestinian people's
democratic will. Those same governments have been frustrated by
similarly recalcitrant peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean, for
example in the cases of Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
an impoverished, vulnerable country like Nicaragua presents many more
opportunities for destabilization. The US government had already
destroyed Nicaragua's economy and society through its terrorist war of
the 1980s. Subsequently, the Western Bloc countries kept the Nicaraguan
people under economic siege by means of corrupt, neoliberal
governments, supinely submissive to the Washington Consensus. Now, the
Sandinista government, under Daniel Ortega's second presidency, seeks
to free Nicaragua from that dead-end dependency.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is an impressive example for other countries in Central America and the
Caribbean, just as it was back in the 1980s. The US, Canada and their
European allies cannot permit that example to prosper without kissing
goodbye to their traditional dominance in the region, their access to
its natural resources, the political compliance of regional
governments, and a free rein economically for foreign capital. In that
respect, the recent visits to the region by Chinese and Russian
leaders, representing global rivals to the US and Europe are very
relevant.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Chinese
President Hu Jintao signed agreements with the governments of Costa
Rica and Peru. Russian President Dmitri Medvedev signed agreements with
Cuba and Venezuela. Those agreements increase Chinese and Russian
competition in Latin America to the traditional colonial and
neo-colonial powers that have previously dominated there. The
progressive governments of the ALBA countries and Ecuador are natural
allies for the new giants of the world economy, because such an
alliance multiplies options and opens up room for manoeuvre, both for
the region's countries and for Russia and China.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">To
close down that room to manoeuvre and to squash those options, the
United States clearly feels it needs to act now, while it still has a
good chance of forcing vulnerable countries like Nicaragua back into
penal dependency. The Nicaraguan political opposition also know they
are up against the clock. If they fail to act now it will then be
difficult in 2011 to defeat the FSLN in that year's presidential
elections. Their political project is now to sabotage the country's
progress before the FSLN can consolidate wider support.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">For
both sides, for the imperialist powers and for the ALBA countries, it
is a race against time in the run up to the next round of regional
elections starting next year and running through to 2011. The
imperialist countries need to increase the pressure and weaken the
Sandinista government as much as possible so as to force it once more
to seek alms from the International Monetary Fund and accept again the
old onerous conditionalities of economic serfdom under which the
Nicaraguan people lived from 1990 to 2007. For the Sandinista
government and its ALBA allies and sympathetic governments like that of
Rafael Correa in Ecuador or Christina Kirchner in Argentina and perhaps
to a lesser degree, that of President Ignacio da Silva in Brazil, for
all of them too, the challenge of the imperialist menace is very real.
Either they resist the imperialist gangster countries ("do what we
want, or else...") coherently and successfully or they will find
themselves the special invited guests to their own political demise.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
Nicaragua what all this means in terms of the mediocre tomfoolery of
the political opposition is a spike in their war on the country's
impoverished majority and an even more shameless anti-patriotic sellout
to the rich gangster countries they shill for. That sell out may lead
to increased capital flight, encouraging investors to head for the
safety of US Treasury bonds. That possibility shows the importance for
the FSLN government of sustaining policies that offer a better return
on investments in Nicaragua than the attractions of US Treasury paper.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">That
should not be difficult. Short and medium-term US government bonds pay
next to nothing right now, a detail which shows how times have changed
since the 1980s. A well coordinated response from the ALBA coutnries,
in line with their recent decision to harmonise currencies and trade
transactions may well show up the relative decline of the Western Bloc
powers.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">That
is without taking into account the probability that China and, or,
Russia are well able, and politically disposed, to unload a small
fraction of their massive dollar reserves in support of the ALBA
countries. Russia has even talked about becoming an associate member of
the ALBA trade and cooperation agreement. Perhaps a relevant question
is "Where is global investment going to go in a recession?"</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Will
it go to the most highly indebted country in the world, currently
trying to money-print its way out of recession, about to start buying
its own Treasury bonds, which, by the way, pay less than the rate of
inflation? Or will some global investment decide to go to a highly
profitable, still growing region, like the ALBA group of countries and
their strategic allies like Ecuador and Argentina? That may well be
another part of the explanation for the imperialist powers'
intervention in Latin America, provoking chaos in Bolivia, Argentina,
Ecuador, Venezuela and now in Nicaragua too.</span><br><br><br><br></td>
