<strong>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the 42nd Anniversary Ceremony of the Nicaraguan Air Force</strong></p>

<p><strong>July 30, 2021</strong></p>

<p><br />
A very good evening, Compañer@s, Beloved Families of our Nicaragua which belongs to us All . Our Nicaragua, where we plant, cultivate and harvest the Common Good for us All. That is the meaning of our Lives, the meaning of our National Identity, the meaning of Life, in a Free Nation.</p>

<p>Compañer@s, every time we talk about what we had to live through, when confronted, challenged by a Hatred that was not only abhorrent in the sense that it reverted against those proclaiming it and who  acted out of Hatred, but one that also left traces in our hearts, I believe it affected all of us.... leaving Wounds ! Wounds that still hurt !</p>

<p>How it hurt us to see the destruction of what had cost us Nicaraguans so much. Above all, the destruction of Peace. How it hurt us to see the destruction of Educational Centers, of Health Centers...</p>

<p>I remember one day, talking with Doctor Sonia Castro, when we were trying to fumigate against Dengue in the terrible conditions prevailing then in Masaya, and how they attacked the Health Center where the fumigation equipment was. And I remember it as if it were today, because I can never forget the moment they wanted to destroy the entire National Medicine Storage Center.  That was so irrational, so senseless, a result of truly criminal indifference, that it is difficult to believe, but even more difficult to forget, because we know it is true. And back then we were there guarding that National Medicine Storage Center, because we could not leave the Hospitals without medicines.</p>

<p>So much for the criminals, the terrorists, and those who actually showed such Hatred for the People. Not just indifference, or selfishness.... Hatred ! Hate born out of a slave-like ambition, because, on the one hand, they regard us as slaves, that is what their Yankee owners teach them, and on the other hand, they behave, themselves, with the consciousness of slaves. They surrender, like slaves. They are imperial slaves!</p>

<p>And I was saying how it hurts to reminisce on those days, when we remember the son of Compañera Amada Pineda, set on fire in the streets of Managua; when we remember Lieutenant Gabriel Vado, set on fire in Monimbó. And when we remember, how can we forget that so-called "priest", who via the social media networks and other communications media called to throw the comrade policeman who the only thing he did was to serve his country, to throw him, he said, into the latrine; he said they should have thrown him into a latrine. How can we forget that?</p>

<p>For us Christians, the most difficult thing has been to preserve our Faith in the midst of all those circumstances of human complexity, dealing with people who falsely claim to promote the Values of Jesus Christ. It has been difficult, but the Strength of our Values, of our Education, of our Christian Families and Homes, our Tradition has prevailed, and the Strength that God gives us, to believe in Him, to have Faith in Jesus Christ, and to know that it is God the Father, that it is Jesus Christ, who blesses us every day with Inspirational Strength. We inspire each other to Work, to make progress, to fulfill that Excellent Commandment, Loving our Neighbor as ourselves.</p>

<p>Those reminiscences produce restlessness, unease, those journeys of the Memory and the Heart, broken and wounded Heart and Memory of all that we lived through. But we transcend and we move forward. Without forgetting. We cannot forget. Because forgetting exposes us to live such misfortune once more. No ! We will never forget !</p>

<p>We can work for a meeting of hearts and minds, because we must do so, for Reconciliation, because we must do so, to move forward Together, consolidating Peace, which for years has been our search, the object of our longing, and our Ideal, in the Mighty Name of Jesus. But without forgetting that there were devils here, that there were satanic attitudes, behavior and deeds. And really, I do indeed believe that realizing that and confirming that there were satanic behaviors and actions here, has in fact helped us to consolidate our Faith in the Prince of Love, Peace and Goodness, our Faith in Jesus Christ, to confront and defeat the satanism that was imposed on us.</p>

<p>We are a few months away from the Elections and we know that our People have a clear Conscience, a clear, very clear vision, and also a clear perspective of the Future. Because it is by working hard, taking care of our Health, also taking care of the achievements that are the result of the work of all us, in Production, in Education, in all the Works and all the Undertakings of a Holy People, a Good People. What we are doing is taking care of these Paths ahead...</p>

<p>And we know that the Nicaraguan People, with very clear vision and a clear Heart, will demonstrate in November that they support their own Future. Not the Future of a few, not some Neoliberal Future, not a dark Future, not a Future of selfishness, of greed, of ambition, of servility to Empires. No ! The Future of the Families that know how to be act as protagonists, but also to complement each other and to live in Solidarity.</p>

<p>We are a very Solidarity oriented People...! One learns it from childhood, to accompany those who are suffering, to help those who are sick, those in the neighborhood who suffer from disease, to be together in difficult moments, and to be together to celebrate times of Happiness.</p>

<p>That is Nicaragua: A Culture of Meeting of Minds, a Culture of Family, a Culture with Community Values. We are a People of Jesus Christ, Consecrated to Jesus Christ, and this Culture of Christianity, of Fraternity, of Dignity, because Christianity is Dignity, it is to promote the reality that all of us have Rights and live with Rights... Human Rights like the ones practiced in our Nicaragua, in every field of Life.</p>

<p>We know that the Future is there, among us, that with Faith every day we wake illuminated, strengthened, inspired, encouraged, and filled with the Love that is Victorious here. Nicaragua is Victorious, in Peace, in Love, and in Unity. We know it, we declare it, and we bless Our Lord God, because He allows us to live like this, as His People. A Heroic, Noble, Dignified, Brave, Sovereign People, and a People that neither Sells Out, Nor Surrenders, Ever!</p>

<p>A warm Embrace to all Nicaragua's Families. We are creating the Future together, and full of Hope, full of Confidence in ourselves, in Our Lord God, we are creating it and we are bringing it closer, because, that Blessing that God gives us every day, Health, the Blessing that God gives us every day to be able to work hard, and see the fruits of our labor, that is a Blessing, a Privilege, and truly, a unique Gift that this People, our People, indeed has.</p>

<p>We are proud Nicaraguans, and Nicaraguans, as we have always said, by the Grace of God! A great Truth, a Genuine Truth. We live with His Light, God gives us Life, and Life to live in this Great Family, in this Sense of Family, of Community and of Advancement, with Love.</p>

<p>Hatred, Never Again ! Satanic practices, Never Again! It is with Love, with Faith, and according to our Beliefs, which are those of a Culture of Family, of the Home, that we Move Forward, in accordance with what we are,  in accordance with our Identity, with our Values and with that Faith that every day nourishes our Hearts.</p>

<p>Thank you, Comrades, Let's Move Forward! Thank you.</p>
