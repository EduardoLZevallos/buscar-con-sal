<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE PEOPLE<br />
AND GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA<br />
TO THE 80TH UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY</strong></p>

<p>Madam President:</p>

<p>Once again we are on this platform which claims to represent the Peoples and Governments of the whole world.</p>

<p>Here we bring, as always, the affectionate and combative greeting of our Heroic Nicaraguan People, who, as we know and say, understand Battles, Honor, and the Glory of defending our Principles and Values, our Sovereign Dignity, our Rights and, particularly, the Sacred Right to Be Free and thus to choose our Cultural, Social, Economic and Political Model, to advance against Poverty, in the face of all the challenges of these inclement moments in the History of Humanity.</p>

<p>We present ourselves here once again, proud of our Brother and Sisterhood with other Combative, Integral, Decent Peoples, as are all the Peoples of the World, Peoples and Families whom we defend, protect and sustain in all our Prerogatives and Beliefs, in all the Cultures and Practices that the Colonialists and Imperialists of the World have wanted to attack and which they have tried to steal from us, without being able to do so, and we know that they will not be able to do so.</p>

<p>In these crucial circumstances of Human history, the dilemma is repeated, the eternal duality, the never-resolved conflict between Peace and War, between Life and Death, between the supremacist claim to annihilate, subjugate and appropriate our Cultures, and our obligation to defend our Spiritual, Social and Material Heritages.</p>

<p>These are moments that define us... Either we are for Peace and Life, or we are cowardly promoters of War, Misery and Death.</p>

<p>For Nicaragua, Blessed and Always Dignified, Sovereign, Forever Free, there is no choice: We Are Life, Health, Steadfastness and Strength... Life in proud and undefeated Hope... We are Light and Truth, as our Immortal General Sandino said, and we are also inspired Conscience and Courage, willing to serve the Sublime and Superior Causes of Humanity; the Supreme Good of All, Concord, Understanding, Sensitivity, Fraternity, Coexistence and Cooperation among all, to share the Goods that belong to Everyone.</p>

<p>The Future is made of the Vigor and Glory of our Peoples, who know that Fighting and Overcoming are synonymous, that Struggle is the Highest of all Songs, and that to Fight is to create the Victories necessary for the Common Good.</p>

<p>The Human Family demands Respect and Peace. The Human Family demands Solidarity inspired Encounter between Beings who are equal in every way, and complementary also, in every way.</p>

<p>The Human Family demands respect for all the Agreements made 80 years ago, when the United Nations was created, to stop Wars and build firm, lasting Peace and Justice, the Treasure and a Patrimony of Everyone.</p>

<p>The Human Family hopes, trusts, proposes and at the same time insists on, demands and requires, Union to reach the Fullness of Intelligence, Serenity, Wisdom, Calm, and Humility, indispensable to build and no longer to destroy.</p>

<p>We are referring to all the issues that are priorities in our Times: Climate Justice, Compensation or Reparations to those who have endured and suffered the misfortunes and evils generated by the selfishness and greed of Colonialism, Imperialism, Racism and all the abominable and opprobrious forms of oppression, discrimination, slavery, and denial of our condition and quality as Human Beings.</p>

<p>We denounce and condemn, as Peoples aggrieved by xenophobic discrimination and barbarism, by the brutality and complete lack of compassion with which we have been and are still treated by countries whose wealth is built on the plundering and looting of our own.</p>

<p>We denounce and condemn, together with all the Peoples of the World, the horrible, hateful and execrable Policies of criminal Economic Blockade, aggression by means of Coercive, Arbitrary, Unilateral Measures, as well as the terrible Migration Policies, which ignore Human Rights, violate Human Rights and are a reflection and mirror of the selfishness and contempt of those who believe they own the World.</p>

<p>Here we denounce and condemn, once again, all the savage, atrocious, incomprehensible outrages at this stage of Life, that the Imperialist Powers deploy via their economic, cultural and commercial policies, seeking to continue dominating us, and grossly trying to intimidate us with their stupid armaments and ostentatious military designs, directed against Peace, in Asia, Africa and our Latin American-Caribbean.</p>

<p>We denounce the inhumane policies against each of us, in all fields... Migration and Exclusion; we denounce and condemn the unforgivable and unjustifiable insults and threats, the unacceptable State Terrorism, all the Crimes Against Humanity shamelessly on display, as if they were the Superior Prerogative of the Imperialists of the Earth.</p>

<p>We denounce and condemn all the insulting and vulgar aggression, verbal, political, economic and commercial along with the bellicose outrages, which also constitute Crimes against Humanity, Crimes against Security, Tranquility, Justice and Peace, the Supreme Assets of our Peoples, which they cannot, and should not abuse or snatch away.</p>

<p>As Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters in the Greater Patriotic Nation, Sons and Daughters of the Great Heroes and Heroines of Our America, Protagonists of Victorious Revolutions, we ratify here our full, unequivocal Solidarity and Brother and Sisterhood with Cuba and Venezuela. Nicaragua and the Sandinista Popular Revolution fully identify with the Battles and indispensable Victories that we are building in these Lands of Freedom, Dignity and Sovereignty, knowing that We Neither Sell Out Nor Surrender, Ever!</p>

<p>Here we also denounce and condemn the citizen and human insecurity caused by the illicit use of implausible pretexts and fallacious, false, outlandish accusations, which are merely yet more interference, along with the threats of more invasions and occupations.</p>

<p>We denounce and condemn the absurd manipulations with demented, far-fetched accusations, using the pretext of drug trafficking, which is a plague and trade of Rich Countries, where millions of consumers live, those Powerful Countries that encourage impoverished people to engage in more production and trade of such substances, trafficking wretchedness.</p>

<p>We denounce hunger as a weapon of domination, abandonment, malnutrition and disease, the unseemly, insulting and immoral treatment of Families, Women, Young People, Children, the Elderly, who are increasingly seen as a hindrance and banished from Life, promoting new kinds of extermination.</p>

<p>We reiterate our historical and permanent condemnation of the Genocide, the barbaric policy of denial of the Palestinian People... We condemn all the savage, brutal, massacres that are perpetuated and spreading, in clear view with the complacency of the whole world.</p>

<p>We condemn the State of Israel, just as we have condemned and do condemn the policies and practices of the other Colonial, Imperial, Neo-colonial and Fascist Powers.</p>

<p>We condemn, therefore, the exile of Goodness, and all the attacks on Life, on Freedom, on Coexistence and Civilization that we thought we had built.</p>

<p>We demand more Policies and Programs for Security, Health, Education, for a Dignified Life... Water, Housing, Technologies, Tranquil Community Life, Employment and Progress within reach of Everyone, for the Good of Everyone.</p>

<p>On the 80th Anniversary of the Founding of the United Nations, let us promote more and more coherence of Human Consciousness. We must continue to raise our Voices, joining Hands and Hearts, crying out and fighting, demanding and striving, so that this stage of Life on this Planet that we share, ceases to be marked by Death in all its forms, by the kidnapping of Intelligence and Soul, so as to become instead Inspiration, Encouragement, and the Strength of Hope.</p>

<p>We call on all of us to work in sensitive and sustainable, capable, ingenious and creative union; we call on all of us to keep making our way, committed and steadfast, building Unity, building Brother and Sisterhood, Affinity and Unity, which is true Strength, fulfilling the Always Further On which as a Deep Spiritual Currency, should be a Daily Anthem and Action for each person, for everyone.</p>

<p>On the 80th Anniversary of the United Nations, we urge us all to change the logic, change attitudes, change behavior, to be truly human, to stop reiterating and repeating the past, without results. Unity along with Brother and Sisterhood should be the Path that we take together, with Courage and Pride, so that we continue to create this other World which is already taking shape to become a new Dawn.</p>

<p>Poverty, Violence and Arrogance, are Ignorance!<br />
To Love is to Fight!<br />
To Strive, to Fight and to Fight on!<br />
To Overcome, Overcome and Overcome!<br />
A Patriotic Nation and Dignity!<br />
A Patriotic Nation and Humanity!</p>

Nicaragua Forever Free</p>
