<br />
September 28th 2022</span></strong></h3>

<p><br />
<b>Address by Daniel</b><br />
<br />
Beloved Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters; beloved Families of these Blessed Lands, Blessed by God, lands full of the Heroism, Courage, and Dignity of the Nicaraguan People, who have fought countless battles in the defense of the Nation, Freedom, Sovereignty, and the Right to be Free.<br />
<br />
Compañera Rosario has read the Presidential Agreement, where our Brothers and Sisters who gave their Lives during the terrorist, coup, that imperialist aggression launched against our People, the Brother and Sister police officers who gave their Lives,  of different ranks, who were fighting there, for Peace, for Freedom, for the Safety of Families, so that Students could be transported to Schools, so that ambulances could reach the Hospitals, when the country was blockaded by terrorists, with the blessing of some bad Christians, or rather, for some who feign religion, but have nothing Christian about them.<br />
<br />
That is the point of that popular saying familiar from childhood: "Habit does not make a monk”. So many religious have committed thousands of crimes in the world, thousands of crimes that are denounced, since the time of the Inquisition, where they burned and murdered those who did not think like them and did not repeat their dogmas.<br />
<br />
Yes, the Holy Catholic Church, burning, killing, incinerating, persecuting, organizing crusades to murder those who did not share their Creed; blessing and giving a Holy Ordinance to the conquerors who invaded our Lands, and with that Holy Ordinance, they said, that the conquerors had the right to own these Lands, simply because they came to impose a Religion with blood and fire, and they brought the Cross.<br />
<br />
When did Christ go around imposing Christianity with blood and fire? When? When did Christ threaten those who didn't think like Him? And he knew how to distinguish when those, confused, criticized Christ, he knew how to distinguish when he said: Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and give to God what is God's!”. Rather the Church became corrupt, prostituted itself, denigrating and staining Christ.<br />
<br />
Not all, not all, indisputably not all the authorities of the Church have fallen into such crimes, into such wrongdoing, horrific crimes! Horrific crimes that continue to come to light, those thousands of children murdered in Canada in Catholic orphanages. There they received the Indigenous Children, children of the owners of those lands the Europeans had occupied, and they put them in orphanages and then they committed all kinds of abuse with the children, and in the end they murdered them... Thousands!<br />
<br />
And the Pope had to go, I think this year the Pope had to go there to Canada, to ask forgiveness for those crimes, committed by those who in the Name of Christ, in the Name of God have committed crimes that truly deserve, now there is so much talk of the International Criminal Court, deserve to go to the International Criminal Court. And these kinds of crimes proliferate in the world.<br />
<br />
Here, in 2018, some Bishops and some Priests taking advantage of their Investiture, instead of assuming a Christian attitude, assumed a terrorist attitude, to the extent that there is a recording of that Priest, when they were burning a compañero there in Masaya, he filmed himself, there is the video, there is the recording where he tells those who have tortured and burned the compañero, he tells them: “Go throw him in the toilet”, or rather a latrine; “go throw him in the latrine”, that is , he gave them that advice on how dispose of the people they murdered.<br />
<br />
Others accompanying the roadblocks, committing a terrible sin by using religious symbols to support those roadblocks when what they were doing was taking away from Nicaraguans the Right to Work, the Right to Life, the Right to Education, the Right to Health.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the police, in an act of supreme discipline, obeyed the order we had given them, not to shoot at the terrorists. And the terrorists were attacking with weapons, because of course they had weapons financed by the Empire, they had weapons and attacked police barracks every day.<br />
<br />
I remember how difficult it was to communicate with the Police Chiefs in the Barracks, and tell them: Hang in there, compañeros! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! While they were being shot at. I remember Masaya, how it was like that every day, talking to Comisionado Avellán every day, and so also with other police stations.<br />
<br />
They attacked out of the Churches, not all of them, but from some Churches, they set out to launch armed attacks on the Police Barracks. And their objective was clear, they wanted to take the Barracks, taking the Barracks so as to then take the City; they thought that the Revolution of '79 could be repeated. And they said so gleefully.<br />
<br />
And some priests, some Bishops, called on people to kill me, to shoot me, what were they waiting for them to kill me. Look at what kind of bishops, what kind of priests. They said so in all serenity! That is, a gang of assassins, under cover of the Catholic Church, under cover, because not all, I repeat, not all Priests, not all Bishops acted in the same way.<br />
<br />
And since when has there ever been such a scene...? I recall the Meeting here at the Casa de los Pueblos, the Meeting with the Bishops, all the Bishops were there, and there they were reading their Ultimatum. For what? For us to leave the Government, for the Police and the Army to be dissolved, for the National Assembly to be dissolved, the Powers of the State, everything had to be dissolved, and then we would have to look for a way to put together a Government and Security structure to the taste of the terrorists, the coup plotters.<br />
<br />
I remember when, with all the tranquility in the world, they read out their Points, well, I was listening to them and really I found their attitude talking in that way somewhat ridiculous. I didn't want to get into any kind of debate there, we just received their little piece of paper and told them that we were going to study it. And I remember that I was there with Chancellor Denis Moncada and Rosario, and I observed to them... "Coup mongers", and they said... "Indeed, coup plotters! They are coup plotters! A coup d'etat!"<br />
<br />
An Institution like the Catholic Church using its Bishops here in Nicaragua to stage a coup d'etat. Since when are the priests for carrying out coups d'etat? Since when do they have the authority to talk about democracy? Who chooses the priests? Who elects the bishops? Who chooses the Pope, the Cardinals? How many votes, who gives them their vote?<br />
<br />
Ah! If they are going to be democratic, let them start by electing with the vote of the Catholics, the Pope, the Cardinals, the Bishops, with the vote of the population to elect the Priests of each Community, let it be the population that chooses them, and not that everything is imposed as in a dictatorship, the perfect dictatorship, which is tyranny, the perfect tyranny. It was for a reason that Dario told them, for a moment: "Where are you going, Holy Tyrant”, Holy Tyrant, Dario said it very clearly, Holy Tyrant!<br />
<br />
With what authority do they talk to me about democracy? How many votes did the Bishop have on behalf of the population to be appointed Bishop? He was appointed by selection, from the Vatican, from someone who has not been elected by the People, he was elected by a group of Cardinals, that's how they elect the Pope, a group of Cardinals, and from there they are make appointments everywhere.<br />
<br />
That is, I would say to His Holiness the Pope, with all due respect, to the Authorities of the Catholic Church, I am Catholic and as a Christian and as a Catholic, I do not feel represented. And I don't feel represented not just given everything we know about that terrible story of 2018, but also by the fact that we hear them talking about Democracy, when they don't practice Democracy.<br />
<br />
It would be a Revolution, a Revolution if the Pope were elected by the Catholic People of the World. Because there are several candidates among them, when only the Cardinals participate in those elections, do not think everyone goes there tamely, I vote... No! Among them are the rivalries, some want the Pope to be this, others want him to be the other; they already have things stitched up, as they say.<br />
<br />
Well, the cleanest, the healthiest thing would be for them to present the Cardinals who aspire to the Papacy, and for the Catholic population of the World with their vote to decide who becomes the Pope; and for the Population also to choose who the Cardinals are, and to choose who the Bishops should be, and for the population to choose in each Neighborhood, in each Community who the Priests of the Neighborhood should be. That's democracy! That would be democracy! So, on the one hand they talk about democracy and do not practice Democracy.<br />
<br />
How terrible it was at that time to see them there in a confrontational attitude, serving the interests of the Empire, defaming and slandering. They didn't care! And with them big business, yes, the same big business with which we had made an Alliance and that the Country had been making its way very well, as never before, Workers, Business people, Government.<br />
<br />
But of course, that was not a good example for the Imperialists of the Earth, who are used to imposing governments that are submissive to them, that are their “sons of bitches”. Yes, as Roosevelt told them when they asked him about Somoza, that how could he be a friend of Somoza? Ah, "I'm Somoza's friend. True, he may be a son of a bitch, but he is my son of a bitch." You can see there, the essence of Western Democracy, what they call "Democracy" when it is nothing more than a form of dictatorship, of tyranny that has been imposed on the Planet.<br />
<br />
And how much the loss of the lives of all these compañeros hurts us. Rosario has read the Resolution where all of them, from the one who had the position of Sub Officer, or Inspector, there are several Inspectors, 7 Inspectors, a Compañera, Juana Francisca Dávila Cano; that is, most Inspectors, it is a rank where they showed that morality, loyalty to the Nation to the People of our police goes far beyond mere rank, because, equally, they fought and gave their lives, Inspectors, as well as Captains, Lieutenants, including a Lieutenant, Zaira Julissa López, there are several Lieutenants, Inspectors, 22 Brothers who resisted and resisted and even while they were murdering them.<br />
<br />
I remember there in the Department of Matagalpa how from the Church of Ciudad Darío and Sébaco they came out every day armed, already looking for the night, to attack the Police Barracks, there firing, shooting, and the Police without responding.<br />
<br />
Today we have given all of them the Rank of Commissioners General, and the Presidency will be in charge of guaranteeing all the benefits that correspond to a Commissioner General so that Families can help each other, their children, their widows can help each other, beyond the help that the Police had already been giving them. We are going to give them their due as a General.<br />

Well, greetings to all the Ambassadors who are with us.<br />
<br />
We already know what destructive campaigns are like and what they are like against Peoples who are fighting for Freedom, for Justice, for Sovereignty.<br />
<br />
Now it has become fashionable to be telling the Nicaraguan people that the “political prisoners”, who are the ones responsible for these crimes, must be released. Well, for them there is a process and in the end the results will come out in the process, just as the Law mandates anywhere in the world.<br />
<br />
But the government that wants to receive applause from the Yankee Empire and some governments of the European Union, go out there, like lap dogs, to say that the “political prisoners” in Nicaragua must be released, and they forget about the political prisoners they have in their country.<br />
<br />
In Chile, yes, in Chile, in Salvador Allende's Chile, a country still deprived under the Constitution left by the tyrant, the traitor, the criminal, Augusto Pinochet, the one who brought “Democracy”, they say, to Chile, murdering the Chilean people, disappearing Chilean Youth, and there they suddenly come out talking...<br />
<br />
And they have a lot of prisoners from the previous government, of young people who protested in the streets, looking for profound change, to wipe out that Constitution, those Laws and those Powers that Imperialism left there with Pinochet. And how did they respond to them? They answered them, and they continue to respond them when they go out to protest, right now they continue responding to them, repressing them with the Carabineros, sending armored cars at them with powerful jets of water.<br />
<br />
And leaving hundreds of Young People blind, because they were being shot with some pellets that left hundreds of Young People blind there in Chile.<br />
<br />
There are also the repressed indigenous people. There is a State of Siege in the areas where the Indigenous Communities of the Mapuche are located... A State of Siege, mind you! And so there are prisoners.<br />
<br />
So I say: With what authority does this individual start talking about us releasing “political prisoners” in Nicaragua? He came to the Presidency but has not done much because he could not, or did not want to, because he is dominated there by the Pinochet tyranny. There is no democracy there! There the Pinochet tyranny is maintained, ruling in economic power, in military power, repressing the Workers, repressing the Indigenous Inhabitants, repressing the Students.<br />
<br />
And so we hear, suddenly, other voices here in Latin America repeating that discourse, and of course, the ones who are leading the chorus for that discourse to be repeated are the Yankees. It is the Yankee Empire that has committed the greatest crimes in the history of mankind... Yes, the biggest crimes! And they talk as if...  they are cynical, because they talk as if they would never hurt a fly, when, nothing more and nothing less, they launched the two atomic bombs.<br />
<br />
The only atomic bombs that have exploded in the world and that caused the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Japan, launched by American imperialism, by American "Democracy"... Just imagine! There are atomic bombs everywhere, there are quite a few atomic bombs in the world, but the only country that has dropped atomic bombs has been the United States.<br />
<br />
There is so much talk about the issue in the world and in the United Nations, a United Nations that is nothing more than a point of reference that ceased to be what it should be and has become an instrument of the Yankee Empire and the European Empire, which is what the United Nations has become. We have a General Secretary who is a pawn of the Yankees, the poor old General Secretary, they have him go here and have him go there. And he doesn't condemn what he should condemn.<br />
<br />
Oh, if Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with Compañero, Brother Kim Jong-un, launches a test rocket, they make a scandal. Ah, but they have millions of tons of atomic weapons. The United States, the British, a number of countries have atomic weapons, so does Russia, it is true.<br />
<br />
But as a result of the appearance of the atomic weapon in the hands of the Yankees, what option remains for other countries which the Yankees have their eye on because they want to destroy them? They wanted to destroy the Soviet Union and after the fall of the Soviet Union they wanted to destroy Russia. So what option is left for other countries? Only to find out how to also develop the atomic weapon.<br />
<br />
The ideal, the logical thing the reasonable thing, if we want Peace and Security in the World, is that all the atomic weapons that exist on the Planet be destroyed, with a total ban imposed on building atomic weapons again, because thse are weapons that if they start to be used again as the Yankees did and there is an riposte, then it would mean the extinction of Humanity.<br />
<br />
Ah, but those who have atomic weapons are upset because Korea wants an atomic weapon, and because even Iran has been developing in the field of atomic energy, not for atomic weapons, but they are accused of wanting to make atomic weapons, because here in this World the only thing that gives Security is to have the atomic weapon.<br />
<br />
Ah, imagine if we had an atomic weapon here, they might say a lot of things, but they would certainly think twice. Of course, we are not about to develop atomic weapons, but we cannot deny the right or criticize Korea, which is constantly threatened, where there was a terrible war, Korea was invaded by the Yankees, threatened by atomic weapons from the area. We cannot tell the Koreans to give up the atomic weapon, they have the right, because it is the practice imposed by imperialism to dominate the world.<br />
<br />
If we really want peace for humanity, we would have to start by destroying all the atomic weapons stores and using all those resources for Life, for Health, for Education, for Development, and we are talking about billions and billions, trillions, which are so much needed for the Peoples. Peoples who in some Regions, such as in Africa, are going through terrible situations, Peoples who right here in Latin America are going through terrible situations. Haiti is an example of how a nation, a people, has been destroyed. And what are they doing for Haiti? They care little about Haiti! They care little that Haitian people are dying, perhaps they want that, for the Haitian people to die.<br />
<br />
This is the message that we want to leave on this day, on the 43rd Anniversary of the Founding of the National Police: Firstly, let's make democracy a reality in all fields, that is, it means that votes are held in all fields, especially in the religious field that is so sensitive. Well, with all the more reason the People should be taken into account to choose who they want to be their Pastor there in the Neighborhood, in the Community, in the Department, in the Country.<br />
<br />
Then, remembering and honoring these Heroes who gave their Lives, defending the Lives of Nicaraguans, defending the Peace of Nicaraguans, and that obliges us to continue strengthening the Police. Strengthening it to be attentive to terrorist activities, because terrorists do not stop plotting, they are continuously plotting, they are looking for ways to do harm, to destroy, as they destroyed Schools, Health Posts, as they destroyed homes of entire Families.<br />
<br />
They would like to repeat that history, but that will not happen again! And for that the police have to be reinforced. Strengthening them to protect Women, in their Rights, their Rights are clearly established there, but we know that Women are victims of totally brutal attitudes... All those murdered women!</p>

<p>Hence the importance of strengthening Police Units for Women, multiplying them, and managing to act in such a way that the Police Unit for Women, when it detects some conflict in a Family, between Men and Women, immediately the Police Station is activated, not to put them in prison, but to look for how to make peace, how to reconcile. And if it's not possible, then they go to the Family Ministry and they go to the Judge, and if matters harden, then they go to jail, but we have to contain what has become an epidemic in the world, the way women are murdered.<br />
<br />
And then taking care of children, we have to take care of children, take care of the girls and boys in schools. We have already talked, General Díaz, about making Special Programs, not just to prevent children from leaving school when it is raining heavily... No! At that moment we have to have a presence, for what? No one should leave there, until the rains abate, and even accompany the children if we are talking about in the dark, as happened with the 2 children who perished recently, a boy and a girl, leaving school they were washed away by the river.<br />
<br />
So, taking care of children in schools... And taking care of the children in the schools so that the crimes that are taking place are not going to be reproduced, especially in the United States of America, where many young people, as they can carry weapons there, go and start killing the students at school, and they kill teachers. And finally they kill themselves.<br />
<br />
So we say, we are talking about a situation of a criminality that leads to those extremes in the United States. And where is the power of the United States which controls so much Wealth, so much Science, so much Technology, which they reproduce every day? And then some fellow goes out on the street and fires at people walking down the street and kills them, and if they are black, more bullets are fired at them, or if they are Mexicans, Nicaraguans, or Guatemalans, they fire more bullets at them, because there is racism there in the United States as well.<br />
<br />
So then, to reinforce the Police, just as the Army has been strengthened, because here the People have two instruments to guarantee the Right to Life of Nicaraguans, the Right to Peace of Nicaraguans, which are the Army and the Police, two arms of the People accompanied by the People, fighting the battles against crime, waging the struggle against organized crime.<br />
<br />
In other words, we cannot neglect all those waves of crime that are multiplying in the Developed World and that then come, as I say, also to reproduce in these countries. And logically in all this the Police share with the parents; that is, they are programs that have to be carried out with the accompaniment of the parents of each school, to give security to schools, to the teachers, to the Director of the Institute, of the school and to the parents, so as in that way they will be given security.<br />
<br />
Then, talking again about the issue of “political prisoners”, as if there were only prisoners in Nicaragua; in other words, they have a glass ceiling, they have prisoners in their own country, they have a coup-derived, terrorist constitutional regime, and they talk that way. Here I would say that they can hardly be talking that way, they have no authority to do it and even less the Yankee government, with what authority? Just imagine! There they murder and persecute migrants...</p>

<p>That's a crime! Yes, they put them in prisons, they have them there for long periods of time, children too, it is a frightening thing, looking for how to prevent citizens from Africa, Asia, Latin America from coming to the United States; those who want to go to the United States to work. They have the right to make their journey.</p>

<p>Have the Yankees forgotten how they got to North American territory? Have the Canadians already forgotten how they got to North American territory? In those times, when they arrived, armed to the teeth, and landed on those lands, they began to murder the Original Peoples, the Indigenous Peoples, who were the true owners of those lands, they began to murder them.<br />
<br />
These are genocides committed by the great powers, genocides that have no hope of redemption. They should be held accountable for these genocides before the International Criminal Court. But what's the matter? The International Criminal Court only judges those whom the Imperialists want to punish, for being Nations, Peoples, Men and Women, who want to be free. When it is crimes against humanity that have been committed there, and continue to be committed.<br />
<br />
And speaking of political prisoners, there is a man there who goes out continuously giving statements, a man with a rather pugnacious face, he looks like one of those brave bulldogs. What's this guy's name? His name is Brian Nichols. He is there barking all the time, they have set him to bark, he barks against Cuba, he barks against Venezuela, he barks against Nicaragua, that is what they have put that unfortunate black man to do. And well, as if he was well chosen, because he really has a bulldog face, yes, he is a bulldog barking there, and asking for the “political prisoners” of Nicaragua, asking, demanding “Democracy” in Nicaragua. But how readily they forget the prisoners the United States has at home.<br />
<br />
In the month of January of the year 2021, that is, we are already heading for 2 years, approaching... In January of the year 2021, we all remember that we saw a gigantic march in the United States, in Washington, a gigantic march there, men and women, with their positions, who did not accept the electoral result, who denounced that fraud had been done to them, that the elections had been stolen from them.<br />
<br />
Then they went to protest in front of the Congress, and one looked at the images, well, I didn't get to see any armed, those who looked armed were the policemen who were guarding the Congress, but there were a few thousand of them. And what happened? They entered the Congress, they occupied the Congress; then the police came to take them out and put the handcuffs on them, they immediately put the handcuffs on the one they are grabbing, and they detained more than 1,000 American citizens there, because they are American citizens, more than 1,000 who were protesting, and since they say that there must be freedom to protest, well, they were protesting there.<br />
<br />
In that confrontation, 4 policemen who were taking care of the Congress were killed. 22 policemen died here, 4 policemen died there, and hundreds were imprisoned there, more than 1,000, and of those now 700 are accused, and of of those who are accused 71 are convicted. Just imagine! So many prisoners, so many detainees in the prison conditions of the United States that are terrible, they are harsh, they are violent.<br />
<br />
And those who demand that we release the "political prisoners", when do they expect to release those US prisoners who are political prisoners? It was a political cause that moved them to protest, they were not armed with cannons, rifles, or machine guns. It was a very strong crowd, of course, there were thousands and they managed to get into the Congress. So, what are you waiting for to release them, what are you waiting for, when there were only 4 dead?<br />
<br />
Here, apart from the police, we have hundreds of dead, hundreds of murdered, here about 200 Nicaraguan Brothers murdered under those conditions, in those circumstances.<br />
<br />
So, I would say to the American government, lead by example, for goodness sake, set them free! And I would also tell the other one over there, who is in Chile, to stop telling <i>chiles</i>, or jokes, when he is supported on the base of a dictatorship, of a tyranny, the Pinochet tyranny, and is exercising repression against students. And Chile has students imprisoned since the time of the previous President, and it also has prisoners from the Mapuche Communities. What are you waiting for to release them? Let him set them free! Since they are victims.<br />
<br />
They are victims, really, because they were not armed as those who attacked the police barracks here were armed. The policemen and the citizens who died, did not die because the protesters were unarned... Of course they had guns! They were armed protests, they were organized, well financed terrorist activities and that is why so much tragedy, so many dead brothers and sisters, so many wounded brothers and sisters, if we count the wounded.<br />
<br />
So, I close with the first point I mentioned, God willing that it be understood that the time has come, since the World is... the World is in total crisis, the time has come for atomic weapons to disappear from the Planet, and that all those resources be directed to combat poverty, hunger, in the Developing Countries and in the same United States where there is poverty and hunger.<br />
<br />
I want to conclude, I am going to ask you to stand up as I mention your names.<br />

Beloved sisters and brothers, beloved Families, beloved Police Officers, on this 43rd Anniversary we can swear before God, before the People, before the Relatives of our fallen brothers and sisters in all times, in the line of Duty, we swear our commitment to all Nicaraguan Families, our commitment to Security for Peace, Security for Work, Security for Study, Security for Health, Security for Life.<br />
<br />
Long live the National Police<br />
on their 43rd Anniversary!</p>

<p><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Remarks by Compañera Rosario, Vice-President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the Central Event of the 43rd Anniversary of the National Police<br />
<br />
September 28th 2022</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Good night, Compañeras and Compañeros. Feeling hurt really. I cannot say we have Joy in our soul at this moment, although this has indeed been an Act of Commitment to Life, from the Commitment to defend Life, of all the Compañeros and Compañeras who gave up their Precious Life, their Holy Blood, so that we continue to live in Affection, Security, Peace and Prosperity.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the criminals who generated all these murders, all this blood, all this destruction, all this pain, will ever feel ashamed of having damaged their own country and their own people like this, following the whistle of the greatest circus performer, the Imperialists of the Earth, following the whistle, wagging their tails, like mice, like servants of evil?<br />
<br />
I wonder, because I see the pain of so many mothers. I wonder when I feel the pain of the children who mourn their lost fathers, mothers. I wonder, is there any possible Forgiveness for those despicable Beings who bloodied our Blessed nation, who violated, who violated Peace? Is forgiveness possible? Will they forgive themselves?<br />
<br />
We, as a People, as Families and as People of Faith, know that the Bible is harsh, very harsh, to condemn crimes, and above all hatred, atrocity. The Bible is very hard !<br />
<br />
When we were devastated, harassed and fighting against that hatred and that genocide that they wanted to impose on Nicaragua, they could not prevail, nor will they! But when we were under that fire of Hell, because it was not Sacred Fire, it was fire from Hell, we read the Holy Scriptures, and we said: This is not the People of God! These are sent from the devil, satanic, every one of them.<br />
<br />
The Commandante reviewed that history and it moves us, because it was painful to live the tragedy of those who calling themselves "Bearers of Faith”, the worst thing is that we now know who they are, some fell silent, ashamed, and I have to say even sorrowful, but we now know who the worst ones are and where they are.<br />
<br />
We live those moments with a feeling of betrayal of the Faith and the Heavenly Father, who did not send anyone on this Earth to murder their Sister and Brothers. How many Cains we knew and have known, and how many Cains now try to give the appearance that they never did anything... The innocents! Which innocents? After they slaughtered truly innocent people, if they stripped Women and Men naked, if they raped, if they tortured Compañeros and Compañeras.<br />
<br />
And the worst thing, I commented to General Avilés there, when the videos, photographs and stories of Brothers and Sisters who were being tortured and painted came to us, some even ran the risk of losing eyes, while the terrorist hooligans were sustained and organized by Priests. There they were, there were videos, photos.<br />
<br />
That's why we say it was a diabolical explosion that will never happen again, because the pain of blood is not forgotten. That Holy Blood redeems all of us and commits all of us to care for ourselves more and more, to be more and more loyal, to each other and to our Land that is Sacred. To be more and more faithful, more consistent with that Legacy, that Heroic Heritage that we have, of so many Heroes. This is a country that is watered, fertilized, blessed by Heroic Blood, Sacred Blood, Holy Blood.<br />
<br />
We are committed to those Families, who need an uncle, a brother, a father, a husband, a boyfriend, a grandfather, a son. We are committed to those thousands of Nicaraguan Families who over such a long time and in different circumstances have suffered that pain that does not pass, does not cease, and they remain committed to Love.<br />
<br />
That is what it is to be a Christian: To believe in Love, to believe in the Passion of Christ, and to say: We walk in Love, we walk in Faith, we walk in Hope, we do not lose Faith, even if some aberrations appear. Because those who negate their Faith from within that Faith are aberrant... they murder, torture, rape, rape and also film it, they destroy, set people on fire, and demand the death of the Authorities. And they gave weeks for a legitimately elected government to leave, and they read their coup Proclamation with an odious taste, a terrible taste, which aspires to be proud but cannot be, because it is a disfigured grimace, a disfigured face, a diabolical face.<br />
<br />
From all that we come, and from beyond, and we feel blessed when we know that we are capable of transcending them, of Fighting to Overcome, of Fighting with all the Spirit we have, which is Great, which God gives us, to continue consolidating this Project that is Truly Christian, that is Socialist, that embodies Fraternity, Solidarity, Complementarity, and that promotes the Common Good and Life with Joy for All.<br />
<br />
So today we are commemorating 43 Years, it is not the exact date, but we are commemorating it today, paying tribute to the Heroes and through these 22 Heroes and their Heroic Families to so many other Heroes, who, as we have said, fertilize our Land, making it more fertile, for the Struggle for Love, for the Struggle for Loyalty, for the harmonious relationship between us Nicaraguans, and to demand Sovereignty... Sovereignty in my Land, which has not been written with any letter, nor with ink, but with blood, and we are here to defend it with Justice, with a Sense of Justice.<br />
<br />
We're not talking about war, the song says. No, we are not talking about war, we are talking about Peace, and we are talking about respecting that Peace that costs us so much, and making it respected by those who believe that because they come from countries that consider themselves great powers, but they are only powers thanks to the crimes against humanity sustaining their development.<br />
<br />
Because they come from those Lands they think they can rule us or dominate us. We govern ourselves here! Here we know what democracy is, we exercise it and we defend it. And here there is no William Walker, neither from the United States, nor from Europe, who is going to come again to offend, to hurt, to overcast our Souls filling us with mourning and pain.<br />
<br />
No...! Here we live with Joy, here we live with Affection, here no one surrenders, and here we say and we say it in the name of the Sacred Commandments: There is no Forgiveness here! Because God cannot forgive those who believe they deserve impunity after they murdered, killed, raped, tortured, publicized, destroyed and burned down this Country where Good People, all our Families of Good Will live with simplicity day to day, working, studying, and, with Hope, creating the Better Society we all want.<br />
<br />
So yes, we blessed, many times over... We have a Soul, we have a Patriotic Nation, and because there is a Patriotic Nation, there is Peace, and because there is Peace, there is a Future, Victorious Hopes, Victorious People, Brothers and Sisters, Families that triumph, that We Move Onward. God is Love, God is not Hate, God is Love and that Love is reflected, illuminates our entire Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
With Great Hopes, then, We Go Forward, and the Future is ours! Onward, Compañeras and Compañeros ! A warm embrace. Thank you.</span></p>
