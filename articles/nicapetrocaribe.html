with Ing. Francisco López, President of&nbsp; Petróleos de
Nicaragua (Petronic)</span> <br>
<br><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">
Early in July , Tortilla con Sal interviewed&nbsp; Ing. Francisco
López, President de Nicaragua's State oil company Petróleos de
Nicaragua (Petronic). Ing. López is a key figure for Nicaragua in the
development of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) &#8211; the
regional economic cooperation programme led by Venezuela and Cuba. Ing.
López talks about&nbsp; the achievements and challenges of ALBA in
Nicaragua, how Petronic has been revived to benefit the Nicaraguan
economy and also comments on the Nicaraguan opposition's disinformation
campaign . This month Guatemala formally joined ALBA's flagship oil
cooperation programme Petrocaribe. Costa Rica also applied to join
Petrocaribe this month. The significance for United States policy in
the region is hard to overstate.</span><br></div>
<br>
<br><div style="text-align: justify;">
TcS: Perhaps you could begin by talking about how ALBA began and how it
has developed so far?<br>
<br>
FL: In effect, we are going to be talking about and getting to know the
most important&nbsp; project in humanitarian and solidarity terms
that Nicaragua has with the friendly, sister Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, within the ALBA framework. This came about before Comandante
Daniel Ortega's victory in this second phase of the Sandinista Popular
Revolution whose only objective continues to be special attention for
people in poverty.<br>
<br>
In 2006, Daniel Ortega, now President Ortega, sent a delegation to
explore the possibilities of oil supply. Contact was made with
President Chavez and various ideas came up within the ALBA treaty and
what is known as Petrocaribe and these ideas came from the
unconditional solidarity-based support of President Chavez and the
Venezuelan people for Nicaragua, to begin with by facilitating
electricity generating plant of which the first 60 megawatts arrived
before President Daniel took office. So those diesel fueled 60
megawatts are working now and are known as the Hugo Chavez plants in
Las Brisas and Ciudad Sandino.<br>
<br>
Then, around the same time, in November or December 2006 the first
80,000 gallons of fuel arrived via the River Rama. At that time, this
was necessary because the generating plant needed that fuel too. The
legal framework in those days was provided by Nicaragua's Association
of Mayors together with Venezuela's PDVSA company and it was geared
mainly to the supply of gasoline and diesel. That was the start, before
the latest victory of the Revolution and the presidency of Comandante
Daniel and the government of Unity and Reconciliation.<br>
<br>
Logically, Nicaragua's oil company Petronic was taken over again. It
had no activity . There existed only a warehouse with the general
manager and four staff. Under neoliberal policies, Petronic was
privatized; all its structures, service stations and the storage
capacity in Corinto and Puerto Sandino&nbsp; That was the&nbsp;
Petronic we found with four staff. These four staff had a management
board of seven and these had seven assistants. So there were 14 people
and four staff. The only functions and tasks they had were to receive
royalties because the agreement of the transfer of all the public
service stations that were handed over to Glencore meant they received
a royalty per gallon that monthly added up to no more than US$40,000
plus an annual rent of about US$800,000. For practical purposes they
handed over a highly profitable service infrastructure for a totally
ridiculous, irrational, absurd price. That was the behaviour of the
previous governments.<br>
<br>
I began that year (2007) in February being nominated and entrusted by
President Daniel Ortega, for which I thank him and of course the
Nicaraguan people, and now we are developing our work so that Petronic
is being reborn with the Revolution. In the present case, we began that
very January 11th when President Daniel took office and took over
Petrocaribe and that is what allowed us to sign a first contract with a
Venezuelan company called PDVSA, a sale and supply contract. It is not
a contract between governments. It is a contract between two companies.
It is a simple business contract falling under the commercial law of
Venezuela and the commercial regulations of Nicaragua.<br>
<br>
There is no debt of any kind. The contract itself implies no obligation
of&nbsp; legal commitments. No guarantee is required of the
Ministry of Finances or any other body of the revolutionary government
of Unity and Reconciliation. It is a bilateral exchange between two
businesses under whose terms and conditions the whole debt has to be
paid within 90 days. That is the work plan. To date or until April,
since last year we have received more than three million barrels and
that represents in money terms about US$290 million which has been duly
paid on time to our business partner and supplier PDVSA. Everything is
in order.<br>
<br>
TcS : One of the things that has come up in the national media is that
there is some confusion over what is the mechanism managing the supply.
Some say it is Petronic. Some say it is Albanisa. Some people confuse
the work of Albanisa with ALBA-CARUNA. Could you explain the
administrative mechanism?<br>
<br>
FL : It's straightforward. The supply relationship Petronic has with
PDVSA is a simple commercial contract which I can give you so you can
see it is a simple contract of sale from one business to another. But
we don't just deal with PDVSA. We also buy fuel from ESSO. We sell fuel
to ESSO. That's normal. Perhaps the issue is not the mechanism but why
a business called Petronic should receive such concessionary terms from
a Bolivarian Venezuelan company called PDVSA. And this is the model of
the Bolivarian Alternative within the framework of fair trade, within
that responsibility and within the new models of commercial
understanding of two revolutions - the Bolivarian Revolution and the
Revolution of the government of Unity and Reconciliation. So the
process is simple and ordinary. Month by month Petronic declares its
imports in detail as any other business would.<br>
<br>
What is going on here is a hostile discourse trying to raise these big
question marks. Critics can go to the Company Register, to the Tax
Office, to the Customs. There are all the import records. Petrocaribe
is a regular business, What the Right gets upset about, those who
conspire and harass the government of the impoverished, the government
of Unity and Reconciliation, is that for them the supply transaction
should not have been run by Petronic but incorporated into the budget
of the National Assembly.<br>
<br>
But that doesn't make sense. Here we are obeying the principles of the
Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua, we are respecting the
procedures laid out in the Commercial Code. That has been the
relationship between Petronic and PDVSA, the first contract which ended
in May this year. That contract says that for each barrel of fuel that
comes to Nicaragua, comes to Petronic in this case, Petronic because
here we have to be clear that Petronic is not acting either through
ALBA nor through Petrocaribe. Petronic in this case is acting as a
business, authorized by its legal statutes which permits it to
undertake obligations with third parties. That is a straightforward
transaction. It is in accordance with its statutes and that is what
allows us to do that.<br>
<br>
TcS :&nbsp; A question some people ask is that they suggest
Petronic, by virtue of being a State or semi-State business, should it
for some reason in future have cash flow problems, these people argue
that Petronic's financial problems could create an obligation for the
Nicaraguan State and that, they argue, is the reason for their concern
about the supply mechanism of Venezuelan oil. What do you think of that
concern?<br>
<br>
FL : It's baseless, the issue of financial problems. PDVSA the
Venezuelan seller and Petronic the buyer have their payments up to
date. No commitment is undertaken involving the State. Furthermore,
that contract between Petronic and PDVSA expired in May this year and a
new contract has been signed between the joint company Albanisa and
PDVSA. What are the terms and conditions? Exactly the same. Albanisa
receives the product and has to pay PDVSA within 90 days.<br>
<br>
What people here fail to grasp and this is where the argument, the
boycott, the attacks on the government come in is that the issue of the
means of payment that Petronic or Albanisa now has with Venezuela is
that 50% is paid within 90 days, 25% is paid to a legal entity defined
by Venezuela, in this case the ALBA fund and 25% is paid to a
Nicaraguan financial entity called Caruna, those are the choices the
owner of the money, PDVSA, has decided on and that is how the matter is
treated in the contract. People know that very well. We have been to
the Economic Commission of the National Assembly three times. The
business project has been explained to them exhaustively with
documentation.<br>
<br>
But for the Right it is not a matter of a business project, rather they
see it as a way of boycotting the work President Daniel has achieved
within the Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas. But at no time has
either Petronic or Albanisa implied a debt obligation for the State or,
put another way, the Nicaraguan State has no commitment with the
Venezuelan government. That is in the contracts. The Controller General
can certify that, since they are reviewing at the moment all the
technical, accounting and financial areas of Petronic.<br>
<br>
TcS : Am I right in thinking the IMF also received an explanation?<br>
<br>
FL :&nbsp; Likewise, the IMF received three presentations
documenting the contracts. It was amply demonstrated to them in these
three presentations - two on Petronic and one on Albanisa - and they
are clear that the matter is a technical one. Technically, everyone is
quite clear that there is no State debt, the President of the Economic
Commission of the National Assembly and the delegates of the IMF. What
the Right never cease to question, their hostile argument, is why
Venezuela should give these concessional credits to a business. Why not
channel them through the National Assembly? That is what they want - to
administer the contract.<br>
<br>
TcS : ¿Would it be fair to say that from the beginning the FSLN foresaw
they would not have a majority in the National Assembly and so for that
reason set up a mechanism outside the national budget?<br>
<br>
FL : We are not improvising mechanisms. The legal statutes of Petronic,
Nicaragua's oil company, date from 1995 and have not changed. We are
applying the law precisely as it stands.<br>
<br>
TcS : Many people who see the benefits of ALBA worry about the effects
of a possible change of government in 2011 or rather after the
elections of 2011 and are worried that the country could lose the
benefits of ALBA as a result of that political change. What do you
think of those fears?<br>
<br>
FL: No way. Because the laws don't change when the government changes.
The laws continue the same. And that is what I was referring to. The
Organic Law reformed with Decree 26 in 1995 approved on July 14th that
year, published in the Gazette, states categorically that Petronic is
an entity with legal personality, its own patrimony, set up for
commercial purposes for an indefinite time and fully able to acquire
rights and obligations. We're not talking about ALBA here, we're
talking about Petronic and we are precisely within the spirit of that
law.<br>
<br>
There is no requirement within these contracts for the government to
intervene of give any guarantees. That also means that Petronic is
subject to the regulation contemplated in laws like Law 477, the
General Law of Public Debt. There is no way to generate public debt,
because public debt has to be authorized by the National Assembly.
Other laws are, Law 550, the Law of Financial Administration and
Budgetary Regime, both administered by the Ministry of
Finance&nbsp; and the Law of Contracts, Law 323.<br>
<br>
All this we have presented to the National Assembly. What faculties
does the company have going by the Decree? To explore and exploit
hydrocarbon bearing resources, to refine oil, to sell oil and its
derivatives, including the import and export of the same. That dates
from 1995. It's not some fairytale we are telling. And finally we can
store oil or carry out any other activity relating to our commercial
life.<br>
<br>
So then we are authorized by the law governing the Petronic company,
just as with the other joint company, which has other regulations but
always within the legal framework and the tax framework. Just so you
have a better idea, when a tanker arrives here, the Corinto Port
Authority receives it, the Customs receives it, the Police, the Army,
even dogs are sent up onto the boat to see it isn't carrying drugs. And
there the authorities look at the Bills of Lading to see what is
supposed to be on board, they look at the invoices, they check if it is
diesel and not something else so as to be sure it is what they say it
is, they verify and not until that inspection is complete does the boat
approach the port, where it unloads and makes the relevant
declarations. This happens every day the world over.<br>
<br>
But the Right, our enemies argue, attack and sabotage. They sabotage
every day via the media using media terrorism to attack this noble
project offering faith and hope to impoverished people. They attack
every day. The line is to reject and refuse to understand how countries
can be in solidarity with us. Why do they want and demand ratification
by the National Assembly? So as to have influence themselves over the
management&nbsp; when their record is negative. Petronic hardly
existed. The business has been reborn. Where it had 4 employees now
there are more than 120 and we are selling 60% of all the nation's fuel
consumption and expanding.<br>
<br>
In such a way that, just as we buy from PDVSA, so we are buying from
ESSO and the national oil distributors but we are also selling to
businesses and to cooperatives. It is a straightforward commercial
transaction. What they refuse to accept is that these new models exist,
justice based models in which one does not talk about free trade but
rather fair trade, where the Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas is
a option favoring the impoverished, the oppressed, the exploited, as we
have been ourselves, and that is now a social model, an economic model,
a financial model. And what would it be like if the opposition had
control.....today the newspaper came out saying "Chavez's oil is a
political project" when every day two million barrels of oil from our
Venezuelan brothers enters the most secure ports in the world in the
United States. I only mention that because no one says anything in the
United States.<br>
<br>
TcS :&nbsp; Venezuela even sells cheap heating oil to low-income
districts there ...Staying with the issue of Petronic's import
capacity. I think I read in the papers a statement from you saying that
in a short period of time Petronic could become Nicaragua's biggest oil
importer. What would that mean for the national economy?<br>
<br>
FL : Nicaragua consumes currently about 10.5 million barrels of oil a
year. Right now we expect to ensure about 64% of that. Up until April
this year we had imported 1,186,000 barrels - almost what we imported
in the whole of 2007. In 2007 we only imported 1,700,000 barrels. Now
up until April we have imported 1,186,000 barrels and we are projecting
to import another 5,300,000 barrels for a total of 6.9 million barrels
or 62% of national imports reckoned at 10.9 million for this year.<br>
<br>
Who imports the rest? ESSO. ESSO last year only allowed us to import
1,7 million barrels. Why? Because they were not buying our crude oil.
Crude oil is most of what they refine here. But now, thankfully, we
have an understanding. They have started buying crude from us and we
are delivering about 500,000 barrels of oil a month. Because in the end
it is the same product they were buying in Venezuela but with certain
concessions. We don't ask them for a letter of credit. They have been
surprised at the fair deal we are giving them.<br>
<br>
TcS : What does that mean for the national economy? What benefit does
it bring for Petronic to be the country's biggest oil importer?<br>
<br>
FL : First we need to be clear that the law does not allow Petronic to
finance anything, by subsidy or by subvention That is not in the
commercial remit of either Petronic or of Albanisa because they are
buyers and sellers and within 90 days have to pay for the product they
receive from Venezuela. What I need to make clear as a Nicaraguan and a
government official, as a revolutionary and a Sandinista, is that, as
President Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo have said, the Bolivarian
Alternative of the Americas has been a life raft for this country.What
would have happened if we had not obtained that finance? When the
problem of power cuts&nbsp; was resolved by that product from
Venezuela enabling the generating plant to operate?<br>
<br>
So when you ask, "what are the benefits when Petronic doesn't fund or
subsidize?" it's simple. The fair trade model of Bolivarian Alternative
for the Americas has various programmes. When I said the terms and
conditions for paying Petronic's oil invoice within 90 days, 50% is
sent to PDVSA via normal bank transfer. It gets sent where they specify
and in addition there's a programme of payment in kind so that instead
of paying in cash we can send beef or live cattle, milk, beans, the
black bean preferred by our sisters and brothers in Venezuela. That is
called a programme of fair trade in kind, which doesn't involve me
because the Bolivarian Alternative has its own operating mechanisms.<br>
<br>
For example, Petronic pays 50% within 90 days by bank transfer to PDVSA
and another 25% to Caruna - which the opposition regards as another
unknown, a mystery, a subornment or underhand payment. But they know
very well it is a straightforward business deal. For each dollar that
enters the country via ALBA the programme leaves fifty cents in
Nicaragua. Those fifty cents are managed by Caruna and the ALBA fund
which we obviously do not manage because we just make the payments and
beyond that we are out of the picture completely. From then on, all
that is managed by PDVSA's ALBA fund which has its own financial
mechanisms.<br>
<br>
TcS :&nbsp; So 50% of the oil purchase&nbsp; is paid to PDVSA
within 90 days, 25% is paid to the ALBA fund, does PDVSA manage that?<br>
<br>
FL : No, the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas has its fund with
its operational mechanisms. Daniel's heroism lies in his decision and
success in joining ALBA. It is not government money and that money
involves no commitment of any kind for the government.<br>
<br>
TcS : The basic line of the opposition media is that everything depends
on Daniel's personal whim. What do you respond to that?<br>
<br>
FL : They know very well, because nothing is hidden in the financial
system and in the relevant declarations, the fund is paid to a
non-governmental body and is managed within the ALBA policy framework.
That framework has social policy areas that are inconceivable for the
Right, inconceivable for the people who sabotage this project serving
impoverished people.<br>
<br>
TcS : So then if 50% gets paid to PDVSA. 25% gets paid to the ALBA fund
managed by the Venezuelan authorities, and the other 25%?<br>
<br>
FL : The contract stipulates that the other 25% should be handed over
to a legally established Nicaraguan entity and we whether as Petronic
or as Albanisa are instructed to pay the money to Caruna, a national
financial body that has existed for 20 years and which as a bank or
financial entity has a contract in the form of ALBA-Caruna with PDVSA
to pay over 25 years. And that fund happens to finance thousands of
Nicaraguan producers to produce beans, seed, maize, then there is the
Zero Usury programme&nbsp; and also the Zero Hunger programmes are
funded in part with money received by ALBA Caruna.<br>
<br>
But the government in its turn has another fund and it is worth
explaining that the government has funds for the Zero Usury programme
managed by the Ministry of Finance Commerce and Industry, MIFIC, as
well as&nbsp; the funds received by ALBA-Caruna, to make possible
and finance the Zero Usury projects. The funds have different sources
but their application is the same. They are commercial transactions but
within a fair framework for people in need. These people pay 4% annual
interest when before they borrowed from usurious micro-credit companies
who lend US$100 in the morning and in the afternoon come looking for
US$120 or else lend at 20% interest per week. This is criminal. These
are the changes the opposition don't understand and which come about
thanks to the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas.<br>
<br>
TcS : Another criticism that crops up from time to time in the national
media in Nicaragua is the slow progress on the oil refinery project
named after Simon Bolivar and its possible cancellation. Can you
comment on those allegations?<br>
<br>
FL : Today La Prensa published a report saying that "Chavez's oil is a
political project" and it talks about the refinery. A refinery is not
like building a fifteen-storey building. To the point that the last
refinery in this country was built fifty years ago. A refinery is not a
simple building project like any other. To the extent that, in Central
America, there are no more than three refineries. Ours here belongs to
ESSO, from which the empire has taken any quantity of profits and has
not even paved a single road or built a single house for people. It
hasn't bothered at all and nobody has said a thing. On that refinery,
not one has been built in over half a century and it is now obsolescent.<br>
<br>
What President Chavez and President Daniel began here with the refinery
called the &#8220;Supreme Dream of Bolivar&#8221; is in the following stage, to be
precise, the advanced feasibility studies are already done as are the
site specifications. The basic engineering and detailed engineering
studies are in process. Not even a year has passed since we began this.
And it is not Nicaraguans that are doing the building. They are
international specialists, ADSEM of France, British specialists,
PDVSA's engineering company from Venezuela, people who have built eight
refineries in the Untied States. This is the experience they have.<br>
<br>
How can anyone say it's like building a structure of ten floors? No,
this is a super-delicate study involving environmental impact studies
taking seven months. The French are already doing the certifications
and these impact studies are extremely demanding. But yes, the spirit
of the Presidents' intentions remains : to have a first stage built
within five years to process 25,000 barrels of the 150,000&nbsp;
which is the design proposed by President Daniel and President Chavez.
But on top of that before the year is out we will see facilities for
receiving oil that will enable us to double our reception capacity.<br>
<br>
So next year, Nicaragua's importer, which will be Albanisa is going to
be able to import 100% of the country's fuel while ESSO continues
importing but there will be competition or an arrangement managed
jointly because we are not trying to take away production capacity from
ESSO, on the contrary as a system we are trying to preserve its
production capacity.<br>
<br>
We can rely on the word of President Hugo Chavez and of President
Daniel Ortega. Already there is investment in definition of the
refinery site. And just defining the refinery's site involves large
scale studies. These are costly research investments. Even a simple
study costs two or three million just for the geological, hydrological
and geophysical aspect or the meteorological aspect. All those
components demand basic engineering studies and that is already well
advanced and certified by ADSEM, a French company that certifies this
kind of study all over the world.<br>
<br>
TcS : Changing focus a little, the oil price went up to US$145
yesterday. Last week it was at US$136. How does this apparently
constant rise in the international oil price affect Petronic?<br>
<br>
FL : We have to recognize that when we talk about the oil price, it is
not set by Venezuela. Nor does Nicaragua set it. OPEC defines those
prices based on the circumstances it sees in relation to consumption,
reserves and in relation to other policies they have. We in Petronic
receive oil at that price and we transfer it at exactly the same costs,
"back to back", the price Venezuela sells to us is the price used here.<br>
<br>
The people who make money are the oil companies who distribute it.
Because unfortunately here in Nicaragua we do not have regulations
obliging Esso, Shell, Texaco or the DNP to apply a fair price. Now in
Nicaragua there is what is known as a free market, what one might call
an unjust market. So then within what we have spoken about fair trade,
those prices affect not just Nicaragua. It is a world problem, a
planetary one&nbsp; and cannot be addressed as if it were a partial
problem.<br>
<br>
What we can say is that people are affected because prices rise
automatically . Not, though, in Managua's urban transport where a
social price is in force no matter what a barrel of oil may cost and so
people continue paying two cordobas fifty cents in Managua's buses and
now nationally President Daniel via ALBA in relation to all passenger
transport has managed a subsidy of US$1.30 per gallon. That is part of
the benefit which is disparaged by the right-wing saboteurs.<br>
<br>
So then, the international price at which we receive the oil as
invoiced from Venezuela is the price we apply. But remember that 50% of
the price of every barrel that arrives in Nicaragua goes into social
projects in this country.<br>
<br>
TcS : Staying a bit with the issue of OPEC, perhaps it is a bit outside
your area because it deals more with the diplomatic sphere at an
international level, but Comandante Daniel a little while ago was
suggesting together with President Hugo Chavez that they were going to
ask OPEC about the possibility of establishing a preferential price for
a group of more than 40 countries, mainly extremely poor countries in
Africa and the poorest countries in Latin America. Do you have any
information about that idea?<br>
<br>
FL : President Chavez in these OPEC meetings has expressed that idea
and it hasn't had any response. And the only way he, together with the
other ALBA Presidents, is able to help is by offering concessionary
terms for projects in poor countries like Nicaragua, like Haiti and
other countries making up ALBA among them now Honduras which has joined
Petrocaribe and is receiving concessionary terms. But in the financial
framework, what the Comandante is proposing in OPEC is that these
countries receive an effective freeze on the price they pay so as to
permit economic stability and maintain economic growth.<br>
<br>
TcS : The outlook in the upcoming elections in El Salvador looks pretty
favourable to the candidate of the FMLN. Do you think El Salvador might
increase its participation within the ALBA framework as Nicaragua did,
if the FMLN win the elections in March next year?<br>
<br>
FL : You have mentioned the FMLN and that is an organization in favour
of the poor. It is an organization for justice. And that means
automatically if they get into government, as revolutionaries they will
join the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas and Petrocaribe,
because these offer concessionary terms that will allow impoverished
people in El Salvador to grow.<br>
<br>
TcS : If El Salvador joins, maybe too the government of Alvaro Colom in
Guatemala and other countries. Right now Ecuador has said it does not
want to join ALBA&nbsp; but that could change in the future, Does
ALBA have the capacity to integrate so many countries?<br>
<br>
FL : ALBA is not just the supply of fuel or oil and its derivatives. It
has other components of justice like Mission Miracle, like literacy
programmes, like the refurbishment of technological equipment in
hospitals. But if we try and identify whether or not is has the
capacity to produce oil for the whole of Central America. Yes,
perfectly. Central America's consumption reaches about 160,000 barrels
a day and here in Nicaragua a refinery is being designed with a
regional, integrationist focus&nbsp; That means that for products
today processed elsewhere in other countries, consumption will remain
the same, only now its origin will be from Venezuela. Venezuela has the
biggest reserves in the Orinoco and capacity sufficiently strong to be
sending 1.8 million barrels a day to the United States.<br>
<br>
TcS : Recently, the United States reactivated its Fourth Fleet. This is
the fleet that during World War Two protected the Caribbean against
German submarines during the Nazi era. And then it was mothballed for
decades. Now in a time of peace they have reactivated it when there is
no aggressive threat in the region. How do you interpret that?<br>
<br>
FL :&nbsp; I think that the more they realize their economic model
is exhausted they are returning to strategies of force, strategies of
imposition, as they have done in Iraq. They do not dismiss imposing
their policies on countries by force. But the Latin American alliance
of peoples is forming and we will know how to defend ourselves. That
move is a threat. It doesn't make sense to take up your rifle if you
live in a time of peace. Or if it is through fear, then fear of what?<br>
<br>
Since their methods, their policies, their neoliberal ideology have
failed, their whole system is collapsing. Here in Nicaragua when the
government of Unity and Reconciliation came to power we found more
people in poverty, more children without schooling, more children
malnourished, nonexistent infrastructure and energy capacity subject to
power cuts. So that strategy has already collapsed economically and
they are looking for alternative methods among which we think they have
not discounted invading any territory they deem necessary or to try any
means to put pressure on the development of countries in Latin America.<br>
<br>
TcS : Do you think it is fair to describe national media coverage o
ALBA as a destabilization campaign?<br>
<br>
FL : It is permanent sabotage. that's how I see it. I also consider it
to be media terrorism. It means attacking the hopes of the poor, the
rights of children, of the malnourished, hungry and thirsty. Those
media don't cover at all, for example, that President Daniel recently
inaugurated another 40 megawatts of generating capacity.<br>
<br>
To give you some idea, in the previous 16 years in this country, only
212 megawatts of new generating capacity was built, in 16 years.
President Daniel and his government in less than two years have
installed 280 megawatts. That gives you a clear idea of the change in
concern about and attention to the country's development.<br>
<br>
What is happening is that none of these ideological vultures in La
Prensa or El Nuevo Diario who attack individuals want to recognize it.
It is well known how they attack me day after day, even my family,
talking about influence trafficking with an amalgam of the most
outrageous lies. But we have to continue showing things by what gets
done and the people are clear that President Daniel and the government
of Unity and Reconciliation is for them.<br>
