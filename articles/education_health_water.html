      <br>
The opposition forces in Nicaragua, which consist of the different
right wing and center right political parties, the corporate media and
a number of influential NGOs, claim that the FSLN, in cahoots with the
Supreme Electoral Council (CSE), perpetrated massive fraud in the
recent municipal elections. "How else could the FSLN have won 109 of
the 153 municipal governments?" they ask. "Everyone knows that the FSLN
government is an authoritarian regime which has not delivered on the
promise of improvements for the poor."<br>
      <br>
The credibility of those who present this version of events as the
whole truth depends on excluding the other version of events in
Nicaragua - the day to day reality of ordinary Nicaraguans &#8211; to ensure
it is not presented at all. Unfortunately for the opposition forces, it
is becoming more and more difficult to deny this other version of
events as, slowly but surely, and despite all contrary efforts, the
government continues implementing its program.<br>
      <br>
Over the last six months Tortilla con Sal has carried out in-depth
interviews with many of the people overseeing the implementation of
government policy for education, health care and water. In an attempt
to provide readers with an insight into this other Nicaraguan reality
(the massive improvements in terms of access to basic services over the
last two years) Karla Jacobs has translated and summarized the main
points made in these interviews.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
transformation of the public education
system</span><br>
      <br>
Last November Education Minister, Miguel de Castilla, <a
 href="decastilla_en.html">spoke
to Tortilla con Sal</a> about the state of the education system
he and his colleagues inherited when they took office in January 2007.
De Castilla described the system as not just "privatized and corrupted"
but also "completely disjointed."<br>
      <br>
The Autonomous Schools Law, which the new education authorities
overturned in January 2007, had created a system within which local
school authorities were not required to report back to the Ministry of
Education (MINED) about their school's financial operations or
educational activities. The amount of money MINED sent to any given
school depended on the number of pupils matriculated at that school.
Having received the funds, however, the school authorities were not
required to inform MINED about how that money was spent. An
investigation carried out by the new education authorities in 2007
revealed that, as a result of this practice, 165,000 phantom
(non-existent) pupils had registered in Nicaraguan schools in 2006.<br>
      <br>
On top
of this, there was no effective monitoring
system to dissuade or punish schools for charging pupils for services
provided. Almost without exception, and without any institutional
control, monthly fees, matriculation fees, exam fees, result fees, fees
to cover the cost of cleaning the school building, fees to help pay the
school's water bill, etc. were charged to pupils studying within the
Nicaraguan "public" school system. When MINED overturned the School
Autonomy Law it effectively banned all charges in public schools. <br>
      <br>
As a result of previous administration's laissez-faire education
policy, by 2006 the estimated number of Nicaraguan school aged children
and adolescents not in school had reached 500,000 (equivalent to 34% of
all school aged children). According to MINED statistics during the
first two years of the FSLN government the number of Nicaraguan school
aged children not in school has been reduced to 360,000 (equivalent to
25%) (<a
 href="http://www.mined.gob.ni/Bolet_MINED/Monitoreo/enero/n07.php">source</a>).<br>
      <br>
Meanwhile the school drop out rate has been reduced from 12% to 6% -
the lowest rate since records began. On top of the obvious benefit of
not being charged to go to school, MINED has introduced other important
measures to ensure kids do not desert the classroom such as providing
free school meals to over one million school children each day and
giving out rucksacks, shoes and uniforms for children in very poor
rural areas where the school abstention rate has traditionally been
highest. </font></font>
      <p align="justify"><font face="sans-serif"><font size="3">In
terms of improving the quality of education
MINED has introduced a system of permanent training for teachers with
monthly training workshops called TEPCEs as well as completely
rewriting the national curriculum. The new curriculum, which was
introduced in February this year, was created with reference to the
conclusions of a national consultation process involving 17,500
individuals including teachers, pupils, parents and representatives of
civil society organizations. <br>
      <br>
One of the fundamental aims of the new curriculum and the monthly
teacher training sessions is to scrap the traditional copy and memorize
method of teaching and replace it with a didactic and participatory
method. In recognition of the profound reforms and palpable
improvements in the public education system introduced during 2007 and
2008, MINED was awarded an Acknowledgment
of Educational Excellence by
the Organization
of Educational Excellence for the Americas (<a
 href="http://www.odaee.org/">ODAEE</a>).</font></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="sans-serif"><font size="3"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A new model of attention within the health
system </span><br>
      <br>
In February this year Dr. Edmundo S&aacute;nchez, Director of the
Health
Ministry's (MINSA) Department for Public Health Monitoring, <a
 href="edmundo_sanchez.html">spoke
to Tortilla con Sal</a> about the implementation of a new model
of health care in Nicaragua. This new doctrine, which MINSA refers to
as the Community and Family Model of Health Care, requires the health
authorities to provide communities with training and support with the
aim of helping communities organize and inform themselves so that
common health problems are understood and prevented.<br>
      <br>
As part of the this new model "doctors and nurses do not just sit
behind their desks waiting for sick people to arrive, they go out into
the community and talk to people about common health problems. ...
There is much greater interaction [between community and health
services]." <br>
      <br>
S&aacute;nchez is adamant that the ongoing implementation of this new
health
care doctrine has already permitted lives to be saved citing the
experience surrounding an outbreak of respiratory syncytial virus in
2008. MINSA was able to communicate vital orientations about
how to treat infants presenting symptoms of the virus via the different
community organization networks it had already been working with. <br>
      <br>
In order to prevent potentially fatal secondary infections doctors were
requested not to hospitalize infants with the virus. According to
S&aacute;nchez, "an orientation as controversial as not hospitalizing a
child
that is having difficulty breathing would not have been accepted by the
community if it had not been for the direct communication between the
health authorities and the community."<br>
      <br>
S&aacute;nchez
went on to cite the 65% reduction of cases
of leptospirosis in October 2008 compared to October 2007 despite
almost identical climatological and socio-economic conditions in the
affected regions (Chinandega and Leon). According to S&aacute;nchez
this
dramatic reduction is proof that "the alliance between community and
health services is already showing results."<br>
      <br>
In
President Daniel Ortega's 2008 yearly report
to the National Assembly other important figures were given which
demonstrate the extent to
which access to medical attention and medicines has increased. The
number of&nbsp;medical&nbsp;consultations registered by MINSA
in 2008 was over 50% higher than in 2006. Meanwhile, the number of
prescriptions given out complete with the relevant medicines in 2008
was nearly 100% more than in 2006.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reversing water privatization,
mitigating thirst</span><br>
      <br>
Ruth Selma Herrera, who is currently President of the State water
company ENACAL, led the struggle against water privatization during
former neo-liberal administrations from her position as Coordinator of
the National Consumer Defence Network. As President of ENACAL she has
overseen the process of re-nationalization of the administrative and
other functions of the company which had been taken over by
multinational companies.<br>
      <br>
Herrera, who <a
 href="ruth_herrera_1.html">spoke
to Tortilla con Sal</a> in February, describes how the former
ENACAL directorate "deliberately abandoned the role the State is
constitutionally obliged to play" in terms of guaranteeing access to
water for the population. This institutional negligence was intended to
make ENACAL so discredited among the
population that full privatization would be considered the only option.<br>
      <br>
As part of this policy next to nothing was invested in the construction
of new water systems or the maintenance of existing systems during the
years previous to the FSLN electoral victory. As a result, over seventy
different water systems around the country were out of order when
Herrera was appointed in January 2007. <br>
      <br>
During 2007 ENACAL repaired all the systems which had been out of
order. During 2008 ENACAL built 33 new water systems in different
towns and cities around the country. The company has plans to build
over 30 new systems during 2009. As a result of the different
investments carried out by ENACAL since 2007 the percentage of the
urban population with access to water had increased from 65% to 77% by
December 2008. <br>
      <br>
For those of us whose lives involve constant personal interaction with
impoverished Nicaraguan families improvements in basic services such as
those mentioned above are an irrefutable part of our understanding of
Nicaraguan reality. The FSLN's historically significant electoral
victory in the recent municipal elections, therefore, came as no
surprise. <br>
