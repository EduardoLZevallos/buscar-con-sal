<p><strong>Address of Compañero Ramiro Valdez</strong></p>

<p>Long live Cuba!<br />
Long live Nicaragua!<br />
Long live Sandino!</p>

<p>Comrade and Brother, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of the Republic of Nicaragua; beloved Compañera Rosario Murillo, Vice President of the Republic of Nicaragua; Sisters and Brothers of the Worthy Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p>I bring a Revolutionary and Supportive Embrace from Army General Raúl Castro and President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, who, like all our People, admire our Sister, Beloved Nicaragua.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Cuban People and Government, I congratulate the Heroic Nicaraguan People on the 45th Anniversary of the Triumph of the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>It fills us with pride to share with this People a common History of Resistance and Dignity in the face of foreign interference and the pressures of imperialist domination.</p>

<p>Yesterday on the field of National Liberation and Emancipation, today facing the dirty war of Imperialism, its aggression, blockades and sanctions. But, in the face of every challenge, frontal or disguised, the examples of Sandino, Martí and Fidel guide us towards new forms of Resistance and Victories.</p>

<p>Nicaragua has the Right which it won in its Struggle, to live in Peace and without external interference. Nicaragua has the right to face its challenges with the work of its children and International Cooperation, without any conditions being imposed on it.</p>

<p>Cuba firmly rejects the Unilateral Coercive Measures imposed by Yankee Imperialism and its allies against Sister Nicaragua, which affect the Nicaraguan population and constitute open interference in the internal affairs of this nation.</p>

<p>Likewise, we condemn the gross manipulation of Nicaragua’s reality, which seeks to leave the image of the Country in flagrant disrespect of the Right and Self-Determination of Peoples.</p>

<p>Sandinista Nicaragua is a Nation of Men and Women emancipated by their tireless Struggle for True Independence, without external tutelage of any kind.</p>

<p>With a colossal effort, peace and genuine Freedom were conquered here. The progress they can show today in economic and social matters is irrefutable, under the successful leadership of the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity headed by Comrades Daniel and Rosario. This experience allows Nicaragua to confront external aggression and destabilizing actions against the Well-being and Tranquility of its Citizens.</p>

<p>Cuba is honored to be and to have been at the side of the Nicaraguan people throughout this struggle for emancipation. 45 years ago the Sandinista Revolution triumphed and the Brother and Sisterhood between our Peoples and Governments was sealed, based on respect, trust and mutual support.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Cuban People, I would like to thank Nicaragua for its Solidarity, its permanent Support, its Sincere Friendship, in the face of the challenges imposed on Cuba by the hostile policy of the United States, which has turned into a real economic war.</p>

<p>Our Countries face great challenges to preserve their Social Achievements, defending their Revolutionary Principles. Today, more than ever, Cuba and Nicaragua need the solidity of their bonds of Friendship and Solidarity.</p>

<p>Our Revolutions have great Strengths to Move Forward, they have the support of our Peoples, who have been able to defend their Right to Self-Determination and Independence. They have the example and guidance of their Historical Leaders, who have left us a Legacy of Dignity and Rebellion, and they have the support of other Fraternal Countries that recognize the value and Independence of Cuba and Nicaragua for integration and the transition to a more Just and Equitable World.</p>

<p>The People of Nicaragua will always have in the People of Cuba a Brotherly People, we are more than two Countries, we are two Fraternal Peoples, who share common Principles, Values, and Ideals, we have a history of Resistance, forged from the steel of authentic Revolution.</p>

<p>To you Comandante, to our beloved Rosario, to the Nicaraguan People, our Fraternal Embrace and our Support and Solidarity. Cuba will always be at the side to this glorious Land.</p>

<p>Long live Augusto Sandino!<br />
Long live the Sandinista Popular Revolution!<br />
Long live the Sandinista National Liberation Front!<br />
On to Victory always!<br />
Our Nation or Death, we will overcome!</p>

<p>From Zimbabwe, nation of Freedoms, Retired General Constantino Guveya Dominic Nyikadzino Chiwenga, Vice President of the Republic. And as always, our Respect and Affection to President Emmerson Mnangagwa...</p>

<p>From the Russian Federation, with love, the Chairman of the State Duma, Brother Vyacheslav Volodin. Our Warm Embrace to President and Comrade, Comrade, Vladimir Putin...</p>

<p><strong>Address by Compañero Vyacheslev Volodin</strong></p>

<p>Beloved Comrade, Comandante Daniel Ortega; Compañera Vice President Murillo. On behalf of the President of the Russian Federation, SeñorVladimir Putin, I come here to congratulate you and all the Free and Courageous Nicaraguan people on the occasion of the forty-fifth Anniversary of the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>President Putin is a great friend of Nicaragua and of President Daniel Ortega. Congratulations on the occasion of the Sandinista Popular Revolution. Our President Vladimir Putin was here on a visit to Nicaragua; President Daniel Ortega remembers how they met back then.</p>

<p>45 years ago you defined your destiny, to be a Free and Independent People; you defined your own Future, your own destiny,  which is to choose your path of development, plan your life, have children and grandchildren, have friendships, and be a Sovereign country.</p>

<p>That has not been an easy struggle, it has been a complicated struggle for your independence. Our country has always supported Nicaragua, we continue to do so now together, we continue to fight for a Multipolar World, for the possibility of having our own future.</p>

<p>We are doing everything we can to make this world fair. Together We Will Overcome. Congratulations!</p>

<p>Long live Nicaragua! Hurrah!<br />
Long live Nicaragua!<br />
Long live Russia! Hurrah!</p>

<p>From Combative and Fraternal Belarus Compañero Roman Golovchenko, Prime Minister of the Republic, on behalf of its President, beloved Comrade Aleksandr Lukashenko... our Warm Embrace to the Comrade President...</p>

<p><strong>Address by Comrade Roman Golovchenko</strong></p>

<p>Comandante President Daniel Ortega; beloved Vice President Rosario Murillo; everyone, beloved friends and fellow Nicaraguans.</p>

<p>I have brought you the warmest and most sincere congratulations from the President of the Republic of Belarus Aleksandr Lukashenko and the entire Belarusian people.</p>

<p>These glorious days you are celebrating the 45th Anniversary of the Triumph of the Sandinista Popular Revolution. A few days ago, on July 3rd we celebrated the 80th anniversary of the Liberation of the Republic of Belarus from the Nazi-fascist invaders.</p>

<p>Even though we are on different continents, we know very well the words that unite us, Freedom, Liberty and Victory. May you always be faithful to the Ideals of the Sandinista Revolution, because it is based on the person, on human person and on your human values.</p>

<p>These same ideals are the basis of politics of our country.</p>

<p>Long live Nicaragua!<br />
Long live the Sandinista Revolution!<br />
We will overcome!</p>

<p><strong>Remarks of Rosario</strong></p>

<p>And our Sister African country Burkina Faso is here in the person of the President of their Constitutional Council, Compañero Barthélemy Kére. We salute your President, beloved Brother and Comrade, Ibrahim Traoré, A Brave Man...</p>

<p><strong>Address by Compañero Barthélemy Kére</strong></p>

<p>Compañero President of the Republic of Nicaragua; Compañera Vice President of the Republic of Nicaragua. First of all, allow me to express my deep gratitude to the Authorities of the Republic of Nicaragua for the particularly warm welcome and attention that my Delegation and I have received since our arrival in this magnificent capital of Managua.</p>

<p>We are deeply honored and touched by this great gesture of friendship that reflects the quality of the relations that our Countries have, whose Leaders and Peoples share the same Values of Peace and Solidarity.</p>

<p>The Victory of the Sandinista Revolution, for which we are celebrating its 45th anniversary today, was a catalytic event for the development of Nicaragua and Latin America as a Continent in general. Through the Revolution, the Republic of Nicaragua has fully found its Sovereignty and has managed to restore the Dignity of its Brave People.</p>

<p>Today, despite the sanctions that are unjustly imposed on it, Nicaragua continues to be a Model of Social Development, and inspires many countries around the world, including Burkina Faso.</p>

<p>That is why, on this Happy Occasion, I would like to congratulate the excellent relations of friendship and cooperation that have united our two Countries since the establishment of cooperative relations on November 30th 1983.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our President was assassinated in 1987. But in recent years, the authorities of our country have wanted only to express their appreciation for the great consideration that our Country and our People have received, which have also helped us to revitalize cooperation between our States.</p>

<p>A great hope that encourages me to congratulate you today is the fact that the Republic of Nicaragua opened an Embassy in our Capital, in November 2023. This embassy adds to the different Agreements that have been signed between our two countries, helping constitute the basis of the cooperation that we intend to nurture in the future.<br />
That is why, in order to help each other face the challenges we have in the present, and for our future, Burkina Faso congratulates you for this commitment of the Government of Nicaragua and we stand by your side.</p>

<p>So I can assure you that our Country will continue to work tirelessly to promote Solidarity relations between our two Nations.</p>

<p>Beloved Compañeras and Compañeros, before concluding my speech, allow me to reiterate my gratitude for the warm welcome given to our Delegation. I congratulate the Authorities from this Beautiful Country, for the excellent organization of this Event, and also, from the depths of my heart, I wish every Success and Progress to the People of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Excellency, Señor Presidente, allow me to take this opportunity to invite you so that soon a Delegation from your country will be able to visit us in our country, in Burkina Faso. A country of men and women of integrity and a hospitable land, a country that is your friend, the country of the late President Isidoro Sankara, so that we can strengthen our bonds of Friendship and Cooperation.</p>

<p>Congratulations on the Celebration of the 45th Anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution.</p>

<p>Long live the Cooperation and Friendship of Burkina Faso and the Cooperation of Nicaragua!</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Rosario</strong></p>

<p>We receive with historic admiration, with enormous Affection, the President of the Assembly of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, Sister Country, Fraternal People, Compañero Brahim Boughali, President also of the Arab Parliamentary Union. And we greet our Brother President, Comrade Abdelmadjid Tebboune..<br />
.<br />
<strong>Address by Comrade Brahim Boughali</strong></p>

<p>Compañero President of the Republic of Nicaragua, Señor Presidente Daniel Ortega; Compañera Vice President of the Republic of Nicaragua, Señora Rosario Murillo; beloved audience; Beloved People of Nicaragua :</p>

<p>We have come from Algeria, a Land of Revolutionaries. The President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria has entrusted me to share today's happiness with you. We have come to share with you today the Day of Triumph, the 45th Anniversary of the Sandinista Popular Revolution of the Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p>What a nice coincidence! What a beautiful month of July, which coincides with the Anniversary of the Algerian Revolution and the Anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution! What a beautiful Month of July!</p>

<p>Just as yesterday, side by side, Algeria and the FSLN were together in Battle, today we are also together, always sharing the same course, but today in the course of the construction of our Countries, in the course of Development, we will also work together, all for the Good of the new generations, of the Youth.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks of Rosario</strong></p>

<p>With immense pride we summon our Sister, Hero of the People and of the Palestinian Cause, Sister of our Brother Patricio Arguello Ryan. With us now the Admirable Bravery of the Guerrillera, Leila Khaled...</p>

<p><strong>Address by Compañera Leila Khaled</strong></p>

<p>Long live Nicaragua! Hurrah!<br />
Long live Palestine! Hurrah!</p>

<p>I am addressing you here today, on behalf of the heroic Palestinian People, and above all of the Gaza Strip, and on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Front, for which I am speaking on their behalf.</p>

<p>I greet the Heroes of Palestine, of the People of Nicaragua, I greet the Martyrs of the two Hero Peoples.<br />
Today I come with a Message, I bring a Message to the Nicaraguan people and also to the Leaders of this People, to the Leaders who triumphed 45 years ago.</p>

<p>I am very proud of you today, proud that you have chosen a Leadership that has fought imperialism, colonialism, that has triumphed, and that triumphs today, following a course towards development.</p>

<p>I am proud of this Leadership, I am proud of my People, proud of this Leadership that has denounced the murderers of children and babies before the International Court of Justice, against Germany that gives its support to the murderers of children and babies.</p>

<p>I salute this great Leadership, strong, revolutionary, always triumphant. We will never forget this People and all those who have supported us since the beginning of the attacks on Palestine. Because we know that Revolutionaries, those who love Freedom, always support Just Causes.</p>

<p>Gaza is asking for help today, Gaza is asking for help today, and we certainly know that the Nicaraguan people will always give their support. Gaza is hungry today, Gaza has nothing, no food, no light, no electricity, no water. Gaza has nothing today.</p>

<p>If I have to say something to the Palestinian people today, it is to tell them that the Nicaraguan Leadership, the Nicaraguan people support them.</p>

<p>We have learned from you, from the Triumph of the Revolution, from your Resistance, and we have in common that we have taken up arms against this Zionism that destroys everything in its path.</p>

<p>To this day, Israel seems to be blameless of anything. No one wants to condemn Israel.</p>

<p>So in the 70s we had the same enemy in common, and above all the Zionist entity of the United States, and this common struggle gives us the strength, the courage to continue the resistance, because you are with us. We are going to succeed, as you did 45 years ago.</p>

<p>Congratulations! We always share with you the Triumph, the Triumph that creates miracles in Societies. I am seeing Children singing for this beautiful Country and also Young people singing for this beautiful Country. And I also see women, women give Life. Applause for every one of them, because they are the ones who give life. And also men, they are the leaders, who always support us and are always by our side.</p>

<p>Thousands of greetings, from Heart to Heart, to the Revolutionary Leadership of Nicaragua, and all Love for all of you.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to the day when we will invite you for the Palestinian Triumph.</p>

<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Rosario</strong></p>

<p>To this historic Plaza of Faith comes the Vibrant Voice, Sacred Flame, of Bolívar, of Chávez, of the Beloved Eternal Comandante Hugo Chávez; of Nicolás, President; the Voice of the People of our Invincible Sister Venezuela, in the person of Comrade Yvan Gil, Chancellor of that Great People, and of the Bolivarian nation... Always Further On, Compañer@s, with Bolívar, Chávez, Fidel, Nicolás, Always to the Fore... Overcoming! Because There Is A Patriotic Nation, There Is A Nation, There Is A Patriotic Nation!</p>

<p><strong>Address by Comrade Yvan Gil</strong></p>

<p>Long live Sandino!</p>

<p>Long live the Sandinista Popular Revolution!</p>

<p>Long live Blessed and Always Free Nicaragua!</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to salute Comandante Daniel Ortega, President of Nicaragua; Vice President, Rosario Murillo, and to transmit, on behalf of President Nicolás Maduro Moros, a Message of Congratulations, a Message of Love, a Message of Solidarity, and above all, a Message that allows us to tell the Nicaraguan people that these 45 years, today more than ever, we celebrate because they have been of such great Dignity.</p>

<p>They have been of such great Dignity, because they have been 45 years of Struggle, of Resistance, but above all they have been years of Victories, of Popular Victory, of Victory for the Nicaraguan People, of Victory for the Sandinista People, and of course, Victory for the Latin American People.</p>

<p>We were very young in the year 1979 and we learned, from a young age in our Venezuela, that a real Revolution was brewing here in Nicaragua, a Revolution of the Impoverished, a Revolution of the Peasants, a Revolution with Sacrifice, with Martyrs, to whom we pay tribute today. A revolution that has been able to maintain itself thanks to the loyalty of its Leaders... A Revolution that today is the fundamental guide for our Region.</p>

<p>Nicaragua, thanks to the Sandinista Popular Revolution, is the Voice of those who want to silence, it is the Voice of the Palestinian People, it is the Voice of Venezuela, it is the Voice of Cuba, it is the Voice of the Poor, it is the Voice of the Peasants, it is the Voice of the Workers. It is a voice against imperialism, which is the main enemy that we are all facing. It is a voice against neocolonialism, which is trying to impose itself in our countries today.</p>

<p>Colonialism is the cause of all the evils in our Region, and Nicaragua, thanks to the Sandinista Revolution, is a Dignified Voice, it is a Strong Voice, it is a Sovereign Country, it is a Country respected in the World for its Voice. There is no place in the multilateral spheres of international discussion where Nicaragua's Voice is not respected.</p>

<p>And Nicaragua has earned that respect in these 45 years, and we need Nicaragua's Voice to continue to resound in the world, we need the Revolution to continue advancing. Today, when the main threat we see in the world is Fascism, Nazism, Neocolonialism. Revolutionary Will is the only antidote that the Peoples of the World have, that the Workers have, that we Latin Americans have.</p>

<p>From Venezuela we have traveled this Road together, in all its phases. We remember with deep affection the Venezuelans who came to Nicaragua to fight alongside the Nicaraguan people once more, and we would do it again. We also pay tribute to them. But there were not only Venezuelans, there were all the Latin Americans, Europeans, North Americans, because a Revolution was taking place here.</p>

<p>And beyond that, Venezuela has continued to accompany the Nicaraguan people, lately in the construction of the marvel that the Presidents, Chávez, President Fidel Castro, Comandantes and, of course, with the incorporation of Comandante Daniel Ortega, namely the Bolivarian Alternative of the Peoples of Our America, an Alternative, now a solid Alliance, a firm Alliance, against Imperialism. And that Bolivarian Alliance is the one that is called on today to confront the aggression.</p>

<p>To conclude, beloved Comrades, Compañeros, I want, on behalf of President Nicolás Maduro Moros, to offer you a gift to celebrate the 45th Anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution, and that gift will be the overwhelming Triumph on July 28th in Venezuela, against Fascism, against the Ultra-Right, and against Imperialism.</p>

<p>Long live Nicaragua!<br />
Long live Venezuela!<br />
Long live the Sandinista Front!</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Rosario</strong></p>

<p>Long live Chavez!</p>

<p>We want to call the Representative of South Africa, grandson of the Great International Leader, and Leader of the Peoples of the World, Nelson Mandela, who arrives from his People, his Country, from his Government, wanting to give recognition to our Comandante Daniel. Our Fraternal Greeting to the President, Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa. Come on, Buddy!</p>

<p><strong>Address by Nelson Mandela's Grandson</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much to the Directors of this Program today, beloved President of this Country and Madam, Compañera Rosario Murillo.</p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to salute the People of Nicaragua for their loyalty to the Revolution of their Country. As Africans we are inspired by the Sandinista Revolution, by the very intelligent leadership of Comandante President Daniel Ortega, it has taken three days to travel to Nicaragua, but I was determined to come and celebrate with you the 45th Anniversary of this successful Nicaraguan Revolution.</p>

<p>As Africans we are inspired by this Revolution and it has had an influence for us to advance in our Liberation in Africa; we grew up singing songs about Nicaragua, about the Sandinistas, because we were inspired by the decision, by your commitment to Freedom, Justice and Liberation.</p>

<p>I am here with you to greet the brilliant people of this country, and I would also like to add, that we love you very much, unconditionally, and that we support you permanently. We see you as part of us, for your resistance, for your resilience, for your tenacity, for your decision.</p>

<p>The struggle of this Country sets the balance sheets of the World in favor of Progressive Movements, and when we see a Leader like Compañero Daniel Ortega, we see an Icon, an Icon of Freedom, an icon of Peace, an icon of Justice, as Nelson Mandela was also, as Fidel Castro was also in Cuba, as all the Heroes who have loved Peace in this World have been.</p>

<p>Today it is a privilege and an honor for me to present before the International Community, and to speak before the Heroes of this People, who are also Heroes of the Countries that love Peace in the World, and this has been ever present in the words and beliefs of Mandela, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, and other Heroes and recognized Figures.</p>

<p>By virtue of the powers we have for the African Revolutionary Ancestors, I would like to give an Award to Señor Daniel Ortega.</p>

<p>Long live Nicaragua!<br />
Long live Nicaragua!<br />
Long live the Sandinistas!<br />
Long live Africa!<br />
Long live the Spirit and the Presence<br />
of Señor Daniel Ortega!<br />
Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Rosario</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much, Compañera, and our Admiration and  Greeting to your People, a combative People, a Brave People, a People who overcome.</p>

<p>Here with us from the nation of Freedoms, we were there when their Struggle for Independence triumphed, there in Harare, in Zimbabwe, and here with us we have the Vice President of the Republic, Retired General Constantino Guveya Dominic Nyikadzino Chiwenga. Our Respect and Affection to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.</p>

<p><strong>Address by the Retired General<br />
Constantino Guveya Dominic Nyikadzino Chiwenga</strong></p>

<p>Excellency, President, Compañero Daniel Ortega; Excellency, Vice President of the Republic of Nicaragua; Excellencies, Heads of Delegation, Fellow Nicaraguans. I come here from Zimbabwe on behalf of the President of our Country, to celebrate this important occasion of the 45th Anniversary of the Sandinista Popular Revolution. As you celebrate the 45th Anniversary of this great Revolution, we join you in this Celebration.</p>

<p>Excellencies, our political organizations were formed more or less at the same time and we forged ourselves in the struggle together. Even though we are separated by many miles of distance, you fought against the Americans, we against the British; you got your independence in the year 1979, and we got ours in 1980. This is what makes us almost like twins, and together we have to keep marching onward.</p>

<p>Yes, we are subjected to coercive sanctions by Western imperialist Powers, but they will not defeat us and will not divert us from our path Creating our own Destiny in our Countries, to increase the standard of living of our Peoples. We demand that these coercive measures be lifted.</p>

<p>You receive the Greeting of the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and we share with you this day in which the armed struggle carried out by your Revolution and the People of Nicaragua is recognized.</p>

<p>Therefore, today is a day of celebration, we celebrate with you, Comrade President.<br />
Long live the Sandinista Revolution!<br />
Long live Nicaragua!</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>Address by President Comandante Daniel</strong></p>

<p>Here, No One Surrenders! Young people are in command and do command, the People is in command and does command, and Daniel obeys. Yes, thanks be to God that we are ready, we are prepared, and this is a task, a labor demanding a great deal of Love for Peace, and that is what Nicaraguans defend.</p>

<p>First of all, we Sandinistas are committed to that Principle, and too, the Nicaraguan people are also convinced that only Peace brings Well-being, Employment, Schools, Hospitals, Roads, Housing, Transportation, Entrepreneurship, Education and Free Education, because that is a Right of the People, a Right of our Families, a Right of our Young People.</p>

<p>Here, in fact, the first step the Revolution took was the Great National Literacy Crusade. Nicaragua then had 60% illiteracy, and under the bullets of US trained murderers, when the Literacy Brigades began to move into the countryside, they began to be murdered.</p>

<p>But the Literacy Teachers did not flee, the Literacy Teachers did not give up, rather, they fulfilled their goal. The Literacy Teachers, in the end, managed to reduce Illiteracy down to 12%. You see, from 60% to 12%. That was the first Great Victory the Revolution achieved for the benefit of our People, for the benefit of the Poor, for the benefit of the Peasants.</p>

<p>Then there was the Agrarian Reform, in a Country where the Peasants had no land, and if one of them had some piece of land, it was taken away by the landowners, who grew up every day on farms which they occupied thanks to the support of Somoza's National Guard, and if any Peasant tried to object, they killed him then and there.</p>

<p>Therefore it was right to give land to the Peasants, and to do so it was necessary to recover the land that had been stolen from Society, from the People, from the Peasants, and thus the Agrarian Reform was another great step. For the first time in the history of our country, large estates started disappearing and small farms were multiplying.</p>

<p>We also set out to build Schools, to build Hospitals, we set out to develop a great Hydroelectric Project, and we even began this great Hydroelectric Project, doing the Studies, for which Specialists and Engineers came from a Nation, a People, a great Power, which immediately after the Triumph greeted Nicaragua: The Soviet Union.</p>

<p>And you have to realize how in multiple fields tractors, machinery, for Agriculture, for Construction began to arrive here. I do not forget the name of Belarus, Belarus tractors were popular here in the countryside, as well as machinery for building Roads and Highways</p>

<p>And the experts were to make Studies that would allow us to have a Hydroelectric Plant able to generate 350 megawatts; we're talking about the area towards the Caribbean, in those territories with large water sources and rivers. And the specialists said, here you have all the conditions for producing 350 megawatts of energy, and they said so with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But then the barbarians appeared. Once again the Imperialists of the Earth, what did they do but organize a war against this Revolution that had only triumphed 45 years ago. The war began in 1979 and the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan came to power, and they began to organize, to train, distributing manuals for torture to the Somoza forces that had been defeated and who had fled to the United States, to Honduras, to Costa Rica.</p>

<p>And the war began again in Nicaragua after we had just spent a long war against the Somoza tyranny, which caused more than 50,000 dead victims.</p>

<p>So then came this other war, armed and financed by the US ruling class, and what were their objectives? To assassinate teachers where schools were being built in the countryside; to assassinate doctors and nurses where Health Posts were being established in the countryside, in the mountain areas; to destroy the health posts that existed; to destroy the schools.</p>

<p>And where the machinery was working, where teams that had arrived from Russia were working on the opening of highways and mountain roads, then the targets were the machinery, the equipment, and their operators. They murdered the drivers and dynamited the machinery. And that kept getting worse, the aggression kept growing.</p>

<p>In the area where they were working, progress had already been made in the studies to start this Hydroelectric Project, and there too they began to move forces, and there was no option but to dismantle the Project; because to do otherwise would have put at risk the lives of the engineers, technicians and workers, who came with the best will in the world to cooperate with Nicaragua.</p>

<p>That is to say, the Soviet Union, led of course by Russia, despite being a great Power, did not come to settle here so as to take Nicaragua's wealth, but rather they came here to lend a hand to the Nicaraguan people, so that they could develop and grow.</p>

<p>That is the big difference between the great Powers that have been colonialist and neocolonialist, for example the United States or Europe, and they have not stopped being colonialists and they are still neocolonialists, they have not stopped being criminals, they are still criminals, they are still murderers, and we see how in Ukraine they arm the Nazi Forces that the Red Army fought in World War II.</p>

<p>Because Hitler, the Nazis, managed to install forces there in Ukraine that were waging war against the Red Army, and they thought that by advancing from Germany towards the Soviet Union through Ukraine they were going to defeat and occupy the Russian People and the Soviet Peoples who fought those gigantic battles in the Second World War but it was those Nazi forces who were defeated that they wanted to revive in Ukraine, and that's what we're seeing now. They managed to impose, via a coup d'état, a fascist, Nazi state and government, and from then on were murdering their citizens, especially those of Russian origin.</p>

<p>And so we have that country which in the '80s provided cooperation to Nicaragua which suddenly finds, with the passage of time, that Fascism is being installed once again in Ukraine, and that Europe, not the European Peoples, but their European governments, most of them, are reinforcing Fascism, fueling a war that is aimed at trying to achieve what Napoleon did not achieve, what Hitler did not achieve, and now they want to do it with the Nazi they have installed there as President, but of course always with them being the ones who provide and manage the weapons, the ones who give all the support, thus putting the world's stability at risk.</p>

<p>And there is another Nation with which we have also had historical relations, the People's Republic of China which has been bringing Progress, Benefits and Development to the world's Peoples who were colonized and who became independent, but who were then subjugated under the boot of the interests of the Powers that had colonized them leaving those Peoples in poverty, with people in misery, people going hungry, people in illiteracy, with infant mortality, in Africa, in Asia.</p>

<p>And the People's Republic of China has been developing a policy bringing benefits to Developing Countries, without setting any conditions.</p>

<p>So now the great Powers grouped in NATO already have an incipient war which is in the phase of them preparing their own peoples for what they call a threat; that Russia and China are a threat, but then too there are the BRICS, where there is India, and they say they too are a threat. That is to say, everything that is a coming together of Nations, of Countries, where Sovereignty is respected, where they reach Agreements to achieve better conditions for their Peoples, they see as a threat, because the Imperialists are used to occupying by force, and then dominating and murdering; and then pointing accusing fingers at us.</p>

<p>Here we have been speaking with the Brothers and Sisters who have taken the floor, from different Regions, and we realize how all these Countries have suffered the boot of Colonialism, Imperialism; how in periods of occupation, of wars, hundreds of thousands, even millions of people have died, in Countries like Algeria, in Countries like Vietnam. Just to mention these two countries.</p>

<p>We also see how the Imperialists are raging at a People who, under agreements in International Organizations, in the United Nations, has the Right to be a State: The Palestinian State. And we see the counterpart, the Government of Israel, and I am not talking about the People of Israel, just as I cannot speak ill of the US people; that is to say, the real criminals are those who are governing, those who have the military power, the economic power. Those are the criminals!</p>

<p>The ones who armed Somoza here, who organized that genocidal National Guard which he used to fight for his regime for so many years, those are the ones responsible. And who are those people? The US rulers. And what do the US presidents represent? They are nothing more than functionaries, from either Party, serving the Military Industry. Such that the more wars there are, then the more business there is for the Military Industry! Serving the great US companies. That is, not even serving the US people, but rather enriching the wealthiest people in the United States.</p>

<p>And listening to the words of Leila, Compañera, Sister, who has brought to us here the Voice of a People that is being subjected to genocide, where children are being killed every day, where young people are being killed every day, and the European Governments, the United States Government, meeting in NATO, decide every day to give Israel more and more weapons, to send ever more weapons, so that the Palestinian People continue to be bombed. And this is clearly stated by the rulers of the State of Israel, who want the Palestinian State to disappear. They say it with no shame at all.</p>

<p>But the Law must rule! It was an Agreement at the United Nations signed by all the Countries of the world at that time, for two States had to be created: the State of Israel, and the Palestinian State. And what are the Israeli authorities saying, now? What do they say? That there should be no Palestinian state, that it should disappear, because it is a threat to Israel.</p>

<p>If we go with that philosophy, we should ask for the disappearance of the United States. The first thing that should disappear is that State, which is the greatest criminal humanity has, and not only for going around murdering peoples and occupying Countries, as has happened here in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Nicaragua was invaded by the Yankees at the time of William Walker, and Walker was defeated; then Nicaragua was invaded by the Yankees, after the Yankees overthrew Zelaya, when Zeledón confronted the Yankees, and they assassinated Zeledón.</p>

<p>And Sandino came and gave them battle, and when the Yankees realized they could not defeat Sandino then they retreated. But they had already organized their Marine Corps here, which they called the National Guard, and their High Command were senior officers of the United States Army. And then what did they do next? Well, they turned that Force into the Force that assassinated Sandino.</p>

<p>That is to say, Sandino defeated the Yankees, so what the Yankees did was to carry out their notorious conspiracy, where the President invited Sandino, because they were signing Peace Accords since the Yankees had already left. He invited them to the Presidential House for a dinner, and when they left, the so-called National Guard was waiting for them, no more nor less than the Guard imposed by the Yankees. They captured Sandino with his lieutenants, and assassinated them, so as to facilitate the Yankees' dominance in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>This is so very true that I never tire of repeating it, because we cannot forget, because if we forget then history repeats itself, and we cannot forget that the President of the United States himself, who received Somoza there in Washington, receiving him with honors, and was always training the National Guard, arming the National Guard, sending them weapons... We cannot forget that when the President of the United States was asked why he was receiving Somoza if he was a murderer, then President Roosevelt answered, and said: He is a son of a bitch, but he is our son of a bitch. The President of the United States said so with complete serenity.</p>

<p>So, with all the respect that women deserve who have that practice, that profession, that is the arrogance of the machista giving the answer: He is our son of a bitch. That is to say, Roosevelt is saying that he himself was a whore, this being an offense, indeed, for those who exercise that profession.</p>

<p>But as far as it goes, yes, that is to say, if it is a question of putting an end to those countries that are a threat to their own Peoples and to Humanity, then International Organizations would have to seriously considered that those Powers disappear, that NATO disappears, and then we will have a little more tranquility, a little more security in the world.</p>

<p>On this 45th Anniversary of our recognition, we take to our Soul, to our Heart, all the Heroes and Martyrs of the People, the Heroes and Martyrs who have been giving their Lives since the first conquerors arrived; as well as to the Heroes and Martyrs who gave their Lives in the last coup attempt of the fascist Yankee Empire, using Nazi practices, in April 2018.</p>

<p>They attacked with all their fury, murdering, burning, torturing, and publishing over social networks the images of the Brothers and Sisters who were being tortured and murdered. They already felt that they were defeating the Revolution, but how wrong they were, they did not realize that the strength of the Revolution is in the loyalty, in the commitment of Nicaragua's people. And when they were defeated, then they began to spread slanders and lies to try and regain ground.</p>

<p>We have demonstrated throughout history that there is a fundamental element in any society, especially with fractures as serious as those that Nicaragua has had due to the intervention of foreign Powers, we have always advocated the Principle of Reconciliation, and in the '80s, we were the first to manage to take steps in favor of Reconciliation with the Original Peoples.</p>

<p>For that's where Autonomy was born, the Law of Autonomy, which has given the Brothers and Sisters of the Communities of the North and South Caribbean Regions the Right to own their lands first and there what we did was to give each Community the land that belongs to that Community, and we made over about 35,000 square kilometers across the Caribbean Coast; all the lands of the Communities there were titled. And that was achieved in the middle of the war, a halt was made, Reconciliation was sought, and finally it was possible to put an end to that confrontation thanks to the Autonomy Law.</p>

<p>But here, in the war against the Somoza Dictatorship, well, Reconciliation was more difficult, because in order to reconcile we had to get rid of Somoza first. Because Somoza had penetrated all the economic groups and maintained a permanent campaign against the Sandinista National Liberation Front, using war, murder, torture, to frighten people. But people finally started losing their fear and then the Popular Insurrections began, ending with the Final Offensive and the overthrow of the Somoza tyranny.</p>

<p>They still made efforts, through the OAS, at a Meeting in Venezuela, to seek intervention to try to stop the Victory, but there were no conditions for that and the advance of the Revolutionary Force was irrepressible, unstoppable.</p>

<p>This day, in what is the most important day of all these days around the 45th Anniversary, days where the People have manifested with every expression of joy, no one has been burning houses here, as they burned in April 2018, when they destroyed University Campuses, Hospitals and Health Posts. No! Here there has simply been Joyful celebration throughout the country, and we salute the orderly, disciplined way in which People have manifested their celebration in the Districts, the Neighborhoods, in municipal, departmental activities, in the activities of the night before, on the Day of Joy, and then last night, awaiting the arrival of the 19th.</p>

<p>That is, there have been no acts of violence there, what we have seen is a great deal of joy. And why is there so much joy? And how can so many people move around late at night? Because there is Peace, because there is Security. Where there is no Peace, then people do not get out and about easily. That is to say, we have managed to recover Peace, and this is a Victory of the Nicaraguan People, who want Peace, who love Peace, who defend Peace.</p>

<p>And naturally, if we want Peace for Nicaragua, we also want Peace for the World, that's why we have supported various Initiatives that have been taken, first of all I would say the most urgent one is to stop the genocide against the Palestinian People, where even the International Court of Justice has pronounced itself very clearly.</p>

<p>Indeed, those are crimes, atrocious murders, but how is that going to stop if they do not respect the resolutions of the International Court of Justice, which, by the way, has a ruling on Nicaragua, in favor of Nicaragua, against the Yankee aggression of the 80s, where it ordered the United States to suspend the crimes it was committing, and ordered it to compensate Nicaragua in 18,000 million dollars that today would possibly be double or triple that amount.</p>

<p>The Yankees, of course, do not pay attention to the Court, they do not respect any Court; all they do is apply force, and impose their decisions using force. But that road leads to hell, they have to understand it, they should understand it.</p>

<p>How many crimes are committed in the United States itself every day, simply because guns are sold as if they were candy, and then people go with those guns and murder children in schools; they go with those guns against Young People who are at Festivals, who are in Commemorations, who are in Concerts, the shooters come and start murdering, disrupting the activity and murdering large numbers.</p>

<p>I believe that the time will come when the US people will have no other choice but to change, to change towards governments that respect the Laws, respect the People, respect Children, respect Schools, respect Migrants.</p>

<p>The Yankees and the Europeans have become the biggest enemies of emigrants. But who was asked for permission by those who arrived from Europe to these countries? They were not immigrants, they came to invade these countries to steal the lands of our ancestors.</p>

<p>Who was asked for permission to invade North American territory in what is now the United States and Canada? Who was asked for permission? They simply decided to go there, started by murdering the indigenous population and then occupying their lands, and then growing in wealth, they also developed that slave labor force to exploit especially the South of the United States, and wherever there was slavery.</p>

<p>That is to say, this war that they have against immigrants, simply goes against the Rights of the Human Species; the right of the Human Species to be able to move to any place on Earth. And it is a right that the Powers that Be have arrogated to themselves.</p>

<p>On this day, we thank God, we thank Christ, who has given us the conditions to be able to hold this Extraordinary Celebration, full of Joy, full of Love, full of Peace. This Event where we unquestionably recognize the value of the presence of the Delegations of States, of Governments, where we have listened to their words, words of solidarity from their Peoples, their Governments, of their Presidents.</p>

<p>We have also heard denunciations, like Leila's, and they have all made themselves present here in Nicaragua, Countries, Nations that show Respect for this small Country, and no one doubts that we are a small country, Darío recognized this when Darío said: “If your Nation is small, you dream of it as big.”  And with our dreams we make it full of Potential, we make it Powerful, and we develop it as we are now developing Nicaragua.</p>

<p>So, we are grateful for the presence of all the Delegations, and the presence of Brothers and Sisters who have been working, are working and will continue to work as they go on in favor of Transformations, in favor of Revolutions, in favor of Peace. These Sisters and Brothers are all over the world, they are in the United States, they are in Europe too, many of them are present here.</p>

<p>And that is the most Powerful Force that Humanity has, those who, becoming Aware of what the Struggle for Peace is, decide to wage the Battle, risking of course, risking the threat of the enemies of Peace, risking the danger of the threat of the enemies of Peace.</p>

<p>But in the World, on the Planet, there are no Peoples, there are no Young People, there are no Women, no Workers, no Peasants who give up. The World's Peoples do not give up, and they continue to make their Way as they go, until the Earth becomes a World of Peace.</p>

<p>Long live the 45th Anniversary of the Triumph of the Revolution!</p>

<p>Long live Blessed and Forever Free Nicaragua!<br />
Long Live Nicaragua, Christian, Socialist, in Solidarity!</p>

<p>Long live the Cuban Revolution!</p>

<p>Long live the Bolivarian Revolution!</p>

<p>Long live the Unity of the Revolutionary Peoples!</p>

<p>And may there live forever in our Conscience, in our Heart, the Commitment to keep fighting for Peace, for Peace and Love, at any cost!</p>

<p>Always Onwards, Not One Step Back!</p>

<p>A Free Nation or Death!</p>

<strong>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua, after the celebration<br />
of the 45th Anniversary of the Sandinista Popular Revolution</strong></p>

<p><strong>July 19th 2024</strong></p>

<p>Good evening, Juan. Good evening, Beloved Families, Good midnight in fact. It has been an intense day and our Hearts are full of Emotion, of Gratitude to God, because it is easy to say, as I was saying just now, 45 Years, but they have been hard, but also rewarding.</p>

<p>Because we know that every day we do the best we can, what God allows us to do, serving our People, so that, every day, we Nicaraguans also feel and know the value of a Revolution that is changing everyone's Life, because it is improving Life, especially for the Families that were in Poverty. Because poverty is the result of domination, on the one hand foreign, but on the other hand too, of the rich serving foreign interests rather than their own people.</p>

<p>We have been working to strengthen Unity for the Common Good, in Alliances, those Alliances that they wanted to destroy in 2018, Alliances that brought Progress, Well-being, Work, Security and Peace to Nicaragua. But in the end we have to return and forge them again, and we have to work for Unity.</p>

<p>Comandante Daniel was talking about Reconciliation and I was remembering Cardinal Miguel and how he insisted that Reconciliation had to be the Banner of Nicaraguans who believe that their Nation comes first, and the Nation is the People. And it is the first thing... Reconciliation, so as to move forward, to strengthen Peace, and through Peace, since without Peace there is nothing, to move forward.</p>

<p>Today, with all these visits by Sister and Brother Peoples who have expressed their admiration for the Heroism of the Nicaraguan People, their admiration for their Courage, for the Struggle for Sovereignty, the defense of Sovereignty, we have felt supported, accompanied, and respected.</p>

<p>In the world, the Nicaraguan Revolution, the Sandinista Revolution, the People's Revolution, the Revolution and the Sandinista Epic Feat, has been the object of infinite admiration. And it is for this People, who at all times, tirelessly, forge their Destiny, a Destiny of Dignity. Because we are a people of Dignity. If we didn't have that Feeling of Dignity we would never have done what we have done... National Dignity and Decorum!</p>

<p>We are children of Darío, of Sandino, of Zeledón, of Andrés; we are their children, and we come too from our Courageous and Dignified Original Peoples; and all that is in our DNA, and all that Dignity and all this Feeling of a profound Right to be Free, is in the DNA of Nicaraguans. That's Why They Cannot Prevail, Nor Will They! The sell out traitors have no place, precisely because they love neither their Country, nor their People... So They Cannot Prevail, Nor Will They!</p>

<p>I reiterate that we thank the God of All Triumphs for our Faith that is our Strength, for these 45 Years and for every day that We Continue Onward, precisely out of Love, out of Awareness that without Peace there is nothing, and working hard All Together to forge that Unity, those Alliances enabling us to make our way along Routes of Security and Prosperity for all Nicaragua's Families.</p>

<p>A Good Anniversary to everyone...! We continue to celebrate, but that Celebration is, above all, a Commitment to Work, a Commitment to the Future, and that Celebration is also, above all, a Celebration of Unity and Honor, and of how privileged we are to have a Youth like the one we have, which is our National Heritage, and who know all about Struggles and about Honor.</p>

<p>Thank you to all Nicaragua's Families for these 45 Years, now Let's Go Onward, Always towards More Victories! Thank you, Compañeras and Compañeros.</p>
