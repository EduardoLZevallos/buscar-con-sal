      <br>
It is strange that the center-left Spanish daily El Pais appears to
have such a warped overview of Nicaraguan politics, something confirmed
by recent coverage of events in the Central American nation and more
specifically by the comparison in terms of the presentation and editing
of <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Daniel/Ortega/intenta/desmantelar/democracia/elpepiint/20100324elpepiint_6/Tes">an interview with Eduardo Montealegre</a>, leader of the opposition party Vamos con Eduardo (MVE), at the end of March to <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Nicaragua/hay/libertad/expresion/Gobierno/elpepuint/20100222elpepuint_1/Tes">an interview with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, Samuel Santos</a>, in February.<br>
      <br>
While the Montealegre interview is awarded a significant amount of
emotive prose to effectively back up his unfounded assertions that
"Ortega is trying to dismantle democracy from within," and "Ortega is
not going to permit free and fair elections because he knows that if he
does, he will lose," the Santos interview, apart from a brief and
"neutral" introduction, is presented in a bare question and answer
format.<br>
      <br>
Apart from El Pais' numerous factual inaccuracies regarding Nicaragua, i<a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/sandinistas/vencen/polemicas/regionales/Caribe/Nicaragua/elpepuint/20100309elpepuint_4/Tes">ncluding the assertion that Montealegre is the "main opposition leader,</a>"
(a ridiculous hypothesis going on his inability to maintain a firm grip
over even his own withering bench in the National Assembly) the
newspapers' coverage is based on the factually unsupported assumption
that President Daniel Ortega's government is a dangerously anti
democratic and authoritarian regime verging on systematic Somoza style
civil rights violations. Within this fictitious context, Montealegre
and other right wing representatives are presented as sane opponents
who should be supported in their quest to push Ortega out of the
presidency. <br>
      <br>
El Pais is loath to look into or analyze the extremely significant
advances in terms of ordinary people's standard of living in Nicaragua
since the FSLN came to power in 2007 or to utter a single word about
the main two connotations Montealegre's name throws up among ordinary
people in Nicaragua. These are, firstly, the biggest fraud in
Nicaraguan history (the Cenis scandal) which effectively bankcrupted
the Nicaraguan State and in which Montealegre played a crucial role
during his time as Finance Minister under former president Enrique
Bolaños and, secondly, the repeated failure of both himself as a
candidate and of his small political party in the country's last three
electoral processes.<br>
      <br>
Like it's UK and US counterparts (the Guardian, the New York Times and
the Washington Post), the supposedly left of center newspaper El Pais
reflects an undeniable political leaning in favour of representatives
of the extreme right in Nicaragua. Unlike in the case of its English
language equivalents, however, El Pais' failure to get even basic
information right regarding Nicaraguan politics is especially
surprising given that the editors do not have the superficial but
arguably significant excuse of not speaking the language (something one
assumes must be a contributing factor in similarly inaccurate reports
about Nicaragua by papers like the Guardian whose Latin American
correspondent, Rory Carroll, is known in certain parts of Nicaragua to
be less than suitably proficient in terms of spoken Spanish).<br>
      <br>
If El Pais bothered to read what leading Nicaraguan political analysts
William Grigsby and Adolfo Pastran have to say about Montealegre, they
might consider revising their editorial policy. Following the recent
regional elections on Nicaragua's Caribbean Coast, in which the
alliance including Montealegre's MVE won just 2 out 90 seats in the two
regional councils, Grigsby and Pastran both commented on Montealegre's
alliance's failure to up its game in terms of popular support. <br>
      <br>
A few days after the recent regional elections, which took place on March 7th, <a href="tortilla/node/5533.html">Grigsby concluded</a>
that Montealegre "is not cut out for regional, municipal or national
elections ... this is his third consecutive [electoral] defeat."
Pastran, meanwhile, explained <a href="http://66.102.9.132/search?q=cache:s5x0CAXt_YwJ:www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D169669%26Itemid%3D1+adolfo+pastran+elecciones+regionales&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=firefox-a">the main reason behind the MVE's inability to win</a>
more seats in the regional elections (and Arnoldo Aleman's PLC's
failure to maintain its percentage of the vote on the Caribbean Coast)
saying that during the electoral campaign "both [the PLC and the MVE]
spent their time attacking each other instead of taking a serious look
at the problems faced by communities on the Caribbean Coast."<br>
      <br>
El Pais' approach to Nicaraguan politics is not just factually
inaccurate, the editors appear to miss the point altogether. There are
many factors that contribute to the FSLN's steady increase in popular
support over the last three years but understanding the two most
important factors - major progress in terms of the social and economic
well-being of the impoverished majority since 2007 and a deeply divided
right wing who have proven themselves incapable of proposing credible
alternatives to the FSLN's program and thus alienated themselves even
further from ordinary Nicaraguans - is crucial to serious analysis of
the current Nicaraguan political situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The final results of the regional elections presented by the Supreme
Electoral Council (CSE) show that the FSLN almost doubled its popular
support in this part of the country where traditionally, the right wing
liberal parties have been more popular. The main opposition party, the
PLC, meanwhile suffered a significant loss in support in both the
northern and the southern Caribbean regions losing the absolute control
over the southern Caribbean regional council that they have enjoyed for
over 20 years. The PLC's poor performance (and the FSLN's impressive
performance) respond to the effect of the political reality outlined in
the previous paragraph at a grassroots level.<br>
      <br>
Montealegre's role within this equation has not been an important one
for over a year now (since he lost to Alexis Arguello (RIP) during the
2008 municipal elections, cried fraud and was then unable to muster up
even the pretense of sufficient popular support to make his claims
appear feasible. And since the Caribbean Coast elections, his
importance within Nicaraguan political life has begun to decline with
even greater speed mainly due to the resentment expressed by leaders of
the PLC who blame Montealegre's alliance for splitting the right wing
vote. <br>
      <br>
For many years now, the US government has done all it can to create a
right wing political force independent of the controversial figure of
former president Arnoldo Aleman (convicted of multi million dollar
theft from the Nicaraguan state during his term in office (1996 -
2001)). This should not be taken as a sign that the US is in any way
put out by widespread government corruption - this particular strategic
decision was based on the US State Department's dislike of the
independence and warped patriotism Aleman's influence brings to right
wing politics in Nicaragua. The US much prefers the likes of
Montealegre and Enrique Bolaños whose obedience makes US dominance of
Nicaragua's economic and geo-political agenda much easier. Recognizing
the strategic gains of a divided right wing, the FSLN has done its best
to avoid Aleman's grip over the main right wing party, the PLC, from
being stamped out. As a result, US backing of Aleman's former allies,
now his enemies, is what gave rise to the return of the FSLN to
government in 2007 and is what continues to prevent a successful union
of the right wing factions today.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This is something which, by now, the US has begun to realize. And an
attempt at a process by which US acceptance of Aleman's inevitable
leadership of a future united alliance can appear justified is in play.
But to a large extent, it looks as though the damage has already been
done - the irreconciliable personal differences between the leaders of
the different right wing factions is not proving easy to overcome.
Reactions to the right wing alliance's misadventure in the recent
Caribbean elections, including PLC Vice President Wilfredo Navarro's <a href="http://nuevaya.com.ni/2010031179563/politicas/wilfredo-navarro-llama-punalero-de-primera-linea-al-qrataq-montealegre.html">description of Montealegre as "a back stabber,"</a> is just the latest in a series of major setbacks on the road to right wing unity. <br>
      <br>
The main problem is that, while the potential collaborators of the
proposed united electoral alliance to defeat Ortega in the 2011
elections say they want unity, it is clear that they want it only on
their own terms. In order to have any chance of success at next year's
presidential elections such an alliance would need to count on the
participation of the PLC and the other right wing parties (mainly the
MVE, the MRS and the ALN) as well as the support of the US and European
funded "civil society" organizations and Nicaragua's reactionary
Bishops Conference. <br>
      <br>
In the near future, the greatest obstacle in terms of the efforts
towards right wing unity will be the election in the National Assembly
of over 30 top government officials to the different State
institutions, something no party or combination of parties can achieve
without the FSLN's 38 votes given that a majority vote of 56 of the 92
deputies is required for this type of election.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The MVE / MRS / civil society / US Embassy position is that under no
circumstances should the current Electoral Magistrates be re-elected
given that these same forces claim they were responsible for carrying
out major fraud in both the 2008 municipal and 2010 regional elections
- claims which have never been backed up with documented evidence. The
other reason these factions want to ensure a more favourable quota of
power within the CSE is that they hope to undermine the Supreme Court's
ruling from last September which cleared the road for Ortega to stand
as a presidential candidate again in 2011. <br>
      <br>
The PLC, whose leaders recently uttered venomous criticism of the main
"civil society" organizations promoting radical change in the CSE, has
a less rigid position on this matter. It is by no means clear that, as
yet, the PLC has good enough reason to give up the possibility of
negotiating the election of all the 30+ top posts on its own with the
FSLN and give way to pressure to include all the other opposition
factions as part of their negotiation team. That would mean giving up
significant quotas of power within key institutions. And Aleman has not
had a positive experience with quotas of power being handed over to
individuals and factions he cannot trust completely. By all accounts it
looks as though Aleman is set on using his power as leader of the
opposition party with by far the greatest levels of popular support to
ensure that the proposed unified opposition alliance is created as and
when he sees fit. <br>
      <br>
The importance of the upcoming elections of top posts should not be
overlooked. They will constitute either a much needed success in terms
of the strategy to resurrect the right wing opposition as a viable
political force in Nicaragua or one more crushing political defeat
dealt by the FSLN, which, by then, surely, will be safely on its way to
electoral victory in 2011. The real question, should the latter of the
two scenarios come to pass, is whether the US backed political forces
will even opt for taking part in presidential elections they are bound
to lose. Montealegre's and Aleman's new found friendships with the
Honduran coup dictator Roberto Micheletti is a worrying sign that they
have other plans in mind.&nbsp; <br>
