<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="220" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rogue_clergy_baez_alvarado.jpg.html" width="400" /></p>

<p><em><strong><span>As a journalist, </span><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BenFRubinstein/status/1558860226425675777" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">I traveled to Matagalpa,</a><span> Nicaragua in August 2022 to investigate reports of state repression against the Catholic Church and a massive disinformation campaign. What I found upon my arrival was a stark contrast to the reports that had been circulating online.</span></strong></em></p>

<p>In 2018, the Catholic Church played a controversial role in the failed US-backed coup attempt in Nicaragua. The church, at times, violently supported the opposition and there were reports of priests and bishops actively participating in the violence. However, my investigation revealed that the situation on the ground in Matagalpa today is vastly different.</p>

<p>Upon arriving in Matagalpa, I immediately traveled to the Cathedral to see if there was any truth to the reports of a massive police presence at the church. To my surprise, I found no police on Cathedral grounds, either on Saturday afternoon or Sunday. I also noticed minimal police presence throughout the city, with the exception of the Curia-house. This contradicts the claims that have been circulating on social media that the church has been closed and that there is a heavy police presence at the Cathedral. I also attended a Sunday mass, where I found it packed with people, this confirms that the reports of the church being closed are false.</p>

<p>I also spoke with local residents who have lived in Matagalpa for their entire lives and they informed me that Alvarez had tried to convince the Cardinal to lead a march against the police. The Cardinal, however, refused and instead chose to align himself with the Pope's conspicuous silence on the issue. This suggests that the Catholic Church does not support Alvarez and his actions.</p>

<p>This is significant when considering the historical context of the Catholic Church in Nicaragua. In 2018, nearly 600,000 residents of Managua signed a petition to have Alvarez's predecessor, Silvio Baez, removed by the Vatican. The petition was successful and Baez was removed from the country in 2019. This decision was based on a leaked recording of Baez admitting to participating in the coup.</p>

<p>However, the arrest of Alvarez is not solely related to his involvement in the 2018 coup attempt. He has been involved in planning violence in Nicaragua for at least four years, and likely much longer. There is evidence that other members of the Catholic Church have been involved in acts of violence and incitement against citizens who are affiliated with the Sandinista Front or were police protecting citizens from US-backed groups.</p>

<p><span>One such example is a video that had been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWQ_MO4uDT4." rel="nofollow ugc noopener">circulating on social media</a><span> in 2018 which shows armed groups bringing and storing weapons inside a Cathedral. Another video shows a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1021930885279571968" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Priest overseeing the torturing of Sander Bonilla</a><span>. And a third video shows Father Harvin instructing people to tie up, torture, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqXGIJiSo2o" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">dispose of the body of a Jinotepe cop</a><span> in a toilet, and then saying he wants to frame the FSLN for it.</span></p>

<p><span>It's important to note that many Catholic Church lay members are members of the FSLN Party, including people belonging to </span><a href="https://www.laprensani.com/2018/06/10/politica/2433412-monsenor-rolando-alvarez-nicaragua-no-aguanta-mas-seguir-asi" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Alvarez's own church</a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>However, my investigation also revealed a disturbing trend of disinformation and misinformation spreading on social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Facebook. Many of these posts are being mislabeled as taking place in Nicaragua, despite clear evidence that they are taking place elsewhere, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BenFRubinstein/status/1558868245301559297" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">such as Chile</a><span>. A video of a man stealing a holy book during church service that is being shared widely online, is actually from </span><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BenFRubinstein/status/1558869326597332992" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Guyana in 2020</a><span>. This disinformation campaign is not only misleading and confusing, but it also has the potential to incite further violence and unrest in Nicaragua. It is crucial that media outlets and individuals fact-check information before sharing it and that social media platforms take steps to combat the spread of misinformation.</span></p>

<p>The disinformation campaign against Nicaragua is also being perpetuated by US-funded media outlets such as 100% Noticias which has explicitly called for the president’s murder and falsely claimed he had fled the country. It's important that these outlets are fact-checked and held accountable for the information they are spreading.</p>

<p>Moreover, it's important to understand the political context of the disinformation campaign, as the US government has a long history of interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, including Nicaragua. The US government has been actively working to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nicaragua and has been providing support to the opposition groups who have been involved in acts of violence and destabilization.</p>

<p>I also had the opportunity to speak with members of the Sandinista Front who shared their perspective on the situation. They emphasized that the government has been working to promote peace and stability within the country and that they believe the disinformation campaign against Nicaragua is being perpetuated by those who are seeking to overthrow the government.</p>

<p>My investigation in Matagalpa revealed a complex and nuanced situation that is being misrepresented by the disinformation campaign that is currently circulating on social media. While some members of the Catholic Church may have been involved in acts of violence and incitement in the past, it is not fair or accurate to paint the entire Church with the same brush. The Church is working towards peace and reconciliation within the country, and the situation on the ground in Matagalpa is vastly different from what is being portrayed in the disinformation campaign.</p>

<p>It's crucial that media outlets and individuals fact-check information before sharing it and that social media platforms take steps to combat the spread of misinformation. The disinformation campaign against Nicaragua is not only misleading and confusing, but it also has the potential to incite further violence and destabilization in the country. Additionally, it's important to understand the political context of the disinformation campaign, as the US government has a long history of interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, including Nicaragua. The US government has been actively working to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nicaragua and has been providing support to the opposition groups who have been involved in acts of violence and destabilization. The disinformation campaign should be seen in that light too.</p>

<p>The disinformation campaign against Nicaragua must be exposed and counteracted to avoid further destabilization in the country, which is already struggling with the ongoing economic, political and social challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the US sanctions and the lack of support from other countries. Only by understanding the complexity and nuances of the situation on the ground, and by avoiding the spread of misinformation, can we support the efforts of the people of Nicaragua to build a stable and peaceful future for themselves and their country.</p>

<p>As a journalist, it's important to note that readers should remain skeptical when reading information from US-aligned media outlets such as Confidencial, Nicaragua Investiga, and Voz De America who have written hit pieces about this author that conveniently left out key facts. These outlets have been known to support a false narrative about the political situation in Nicaragua, and if they had included all relevant facts in their reporting, they would not have been able to construct this narrative. It's crucial for readers to fact-check information and understand the complexity and nuances of the situation in Nicaragua in order to have informed opinions about the country's political situation.</p>
