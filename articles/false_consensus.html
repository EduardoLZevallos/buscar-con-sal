<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Nicaragua : countering the
false
consensus</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">by toni solo, March 10th 2009</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">For many people in North
America and
Europe, Nicaragua's municipal elections in 2008 marked a watershed in
terms of their support. Many self -styled progressives tended to
believe the Nicaraguan opposition's false claims of electoral fraud.
The main right wing opposition party - the Constitutional Liberal
Party (PLC) - was supported by the centre-right social democrat
Sandinista Renewal Movement (MRS) in a massive campaign trying to
mobilize international condemnation of the governing Sandinista
National Liberation Front (FSLN). In response, FSLN supporters
mobilised their own <a href="letter.html">manifesto</a>
campaign which attracted important and broad based <a href="firmas_carta.html">international
support</a>, especially in Latin America.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Nicaragua's fractious
political
opposition breaks and remakes frequently, causing much confusion to
casual observers of Nicaragua's political scene. In general, the
United States embassy supports the extreme right-wing representing
Nicaragua's traditional oligarchy whose current political leader is
Eduardo Montealegre. European Union governments tend to favour MRS
leaders like Dora Maria Tellez, Edmundo Jarquin and Victor Hugo
Tinoco. The MRS has been very successful in mobilising support
internationally. Within Nicaragua, they have never won more than around 7% support in any national election.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Their articulate,
persuasive
spokespeople include internationally acclaimed novelists like
Gioconda Belli and Sergio Ramirez as well as Ernesto Cardenal,
Nicaragua's most famous living poet. They tend to appeal to
distinguished individuals who were friends with them during the
Sandinista People's Revolution of the 1980s. The MRS appeal is
essentially a class appeal to the intellectual-managerial class that
has great influence in the North American and European media. Another
leading MRS opposition figure,&nbsp; Monica Baltodano, of the MRS
bloc in the National Assembly, is a maverick virulently opposed to
the FSLN, who in practice works with the right wing but offers a
left-wing discourse for the benefit of her foreign supporters.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">In December 2008, in various of its editions, Le Monde
Diplomatique
published "Democracia pactada en Nicaragua", an article by
Baltodano continuing her&nbsp;long-standing vendetta against Daniel
Ortega and his colleagues in Nicaragua's governing FSLN party. Her
fundamental accusation is that Ortega has betrayed the ideals of the
Sandinista People's Revolution of the 1980s. That accusation is also
the mainstay of an article published in both Counterpunch and ZNet by
Roger Burbach of the California-based Center for the Study of the
Americas <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/burbach02272009.html">"Et
Tu, Daniel? The Betrayal of the Sandinista Revolution"</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">On every point of
substance, in his
account of Nicaraguan politics and economics over the last few years,
Roger Burbach seems to rely completely on interpretations borrowed
from Nicaraguan opposition social democrat politicians and their
right wing allies. Where it is not factually inaccurate, Burbach's
account is wrong or confused. While <a href="anti-burbach.html">available
detailed analysis</a> may be worth following up, the broader role
of
anti-FSLN propaganda is perhaps of more immediate interest and
concern. The articles by Burbach and Baltodano conform to a standard
format whose characteristics seldom vary.</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Both right-wing and progressive critics deliberately downplay or omit
the
FSLN government's impressive achievements in social and economic
policy and, for example, its reversal of previous governments' attempts
to privatize the country's State-owned water utility. By contrast, just
like the US government and its European allies, they tend to exaggerate
and distort concerns about
accountability and democracy. In 2007, the Nicaraguan opposition
focused on what they alleged was arbitrary mismanagement of
development project funding derived from Nicaragua's
concessionary oil agreement with Venezuela under the ALBA framework.
Currently, the Nicaraguan opposition is following up its false
accusations of electoral fraud in the 2008 round of municipal
elections, in
which the FSLN won 109 out of 153 municipalities.</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
ALBA</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach's account of
alleged abuse of
ALBA funds is typical of&nbsp;Nicaraguan opposition supporters
commentary. He
writes in his recent article, &#8220;...under the rubric of ALBA, Ortega
signed an accord with Venezuela that provides an estimated $300
million to $500 million in funds personally administered by Ortega
with no public accountability."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Whether out of ignorance or
ill-intent,
his statement is completely inaccurate. Last year Daniel Ortega
publicly announced the ALBA funds have contributed well over US$500
million to a wide range of development projects. On January 11th
2007, the day after his inauguration, Daniel Ortega signed an
agreement, together with Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales and Cuban
Vice-President Juan Ramón Machado, making Nicaragua a full
member of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas - ALBA.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">At the same time, Francisco
Lopez, the
new head of Nicaragua's State oil company, Petronic, strengthened an
already existing arrangement with Venezuela under the Petrocaribe
agreement. Petronic signed a commercial agreement (convenio) with
Venezuela's State oil company PDVSA. The agreement's main points were
that Petronic would import oil and oil derivatives from Venezuela and
pay 50% of the amount due within 30 days. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The remaining 50% would be
repaid over
20 years at 2% interest. Over that period 25% of the total amount due
was to be managed by PDVSA through an ALBA social fund. The remaining
25% was to be administered by a Nicaraguan institution. In practice,
both parts of the outstanding 50% are administered on the basis of a
commercial financial agreement between PDVSA and the Caja Rural
Nacional (CARUNA) &#8211; a savings and loan cooperative, founded in the
mid 1990s, that administers funds for numerous foreign organizations
working in Nicaragua. Subsquently, PDVSA and Petronic set up a joint
company called ALBANISA in which PDVSA is the majority shareholder
but operating on the same basis as that of the first convenio between
Petronic and PDVSA. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Petronic is subject to all
the controls
that apply to State companies in Nicaragua. It reports regularly to
the Economic Affairs Committee of Nicaragua's National Assembly. It
is obliged to file annual accounts with the tax office of the Finance
Ministry and to keep its records up to date in the Registro
Mercantil. It is also subject to audit by the independent State audit
body, the Contraloría General.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">CARUNA as a savings and
loan
cooperative is subject to the relevant legislation that applies to
financial institutions in Nicaragua as well as to the law applying to
cooperatives. As a financial institution it is supervised by the
Superintendencia de Bancos y Otras Organizaciones Financieras and has
to file tax returns and other relevant reports to the Ministry of
Finance. As a cooperative it is subject to supervision by the
Instituto de Fomento a las Cooperativas. As a cooperative Caruna also
has to report regularly to its members and its board has to submit to
periodic elections.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">So it is completely untrue
that Daniel
Ortega personally administers hundreds of millions of dollars with no
accountability. He has to work within the restrictions of Nicaragua's
relevant national legislation and also within the terms of the
agreements both with PDVSA and the other ALBA governments which have
their own reporting and audit processes to control the use of ALBA
funds.</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Municipal elections</p><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
In similar fashion to the false
claims around the ALBA funding, FSLN opponents misreport the facts of
the municipal elections. Burbach, for example, writes &#8220;independent
surveys indicated that the opposition candidates would win the
majority of the seats&#8221;. But of the surveys published in the run up
to the municipal elections, most opinion polls predicted gains for
the FSLN. In particular, they predicted victory in Managua for the
FSLN candidate Alexis Argüello by a margin of victory similar to
that which he in fact obtained. CID-Gallup's polling was typical in
that respect, with about 30% of those polled undecided. It is
completely false to suggest the opinion polls predicted an opposition
win.
</span><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach goes on, &#8220;An
independent
Nicaraguan group, Ethics and Transparency, organized tens of
thousands of observers but was denied accreditation, forcing them to
observe the election from outside polling stations. But the group
estimates that irregularities took place at a third of the polling
places.&#8221; No one unfamiliar with Nicaragua could possibly judge the
truth of Burbach's assertion here, because so many facts and so much
context get left out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">&#8220;Etica y Transparencia&#8221; is
an NGO
heavily dependent on funding from USAID. It has participated
regularly in anti-government demonstrations. The Supreme Electoral
Council decided Etica y Transparencia did not meet the criteria of
independence and impartiality normally expected of election
observers. Etica y Transparencia is a local group of Transparency
International one of the plethora of multinational NGOs promoting the
political agenda of imperialist globalization.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">In its recent report on the
municipal
elections held on November 9th (and January 18th for seven
municipalities in Nicaragua's northern Atlantic Coast) Etica y
Transparencia presented evidence of what they are calling
&#8220;irregularities&#8221; in 33 municipalities - that is, some events that
may or may not amount to electoral fraud, depending on one's
interpretation of them, in 21% of the country's 153 municipalities -
not one third as Burbach states. So now, after having for months
alleged massive, wholesale, indisputable nationwide fraud, even the
US embassy's main vehicle for destabilizing the Nicaraguan electoral
process has in effect admitted that they were wrong. Their report is
a lame attempt to justify the substantial funding they received from
donors like USAID and their parent Transparency International.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Like so many other
commentators,
including writers for the BBC and the UK's Independent, for example,
Burbach omits to note that 150 international independent election
observers from all over Latin America&#8211; all electoral professionals
with current or recent experience of organizing elections -
participated in the municipal elections of November 9th. They
reported that the elections were free, fair and very well organized.
So one is left with the choice of who to believe : a USAID funded
outfit clearly identified with the Nicaraguan political opposition
which was not directly involved in the election process, or, genuinely
impartial electoral professionals from all over Latin America and the
Caribbean who worked with the national authorities throughout the
whole electoral process.</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Who cares?</p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Stepping back from the controversy, one ends
up asking why anyone should care. Nicaragua is a tiny country with a
population much smaller than most rich countries' capital
cities. There are probably two main reasons why so much energy gets
invested in arguing the minutiae of Nicaragua's internal affairs. One
reason, constant ever since the 19th Century, is
Nicaragua's location
on the Central American isthmus. The United States and its allies view control of
that narrow inter-oceanic region as a vital strategic concern. </p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The
second reason is that ever since the Sandinista People's Revolution
of 1979, the Sandinista National Liberation Front has posed a
categorical challenge to the United States' perceived interests and
those of its European allies. FSLN leader Daniel Ortega's election as
Nicaraguan President in 2006 startled foreign
observers in
the United States, Canada and Europe. So when Venezuela's President
Hugo Chavez, Bolivia's President Evo Morales and Cuba's
Vice-President Juan Ramon Machado welcomed Nicaragua into ALBA on
January 11th 2007, the United States and its allies were almost
certain to react badly.&nbsp;If El Salvador joins ALBA following a
possible FMLN win in country's presidential elections on March 15th,
the&nbsp;US will have effectively lost its former "backyard". </p>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
One superficially puzzling aspect is
that, whereas the Bolivian and Venezuelan governments receive quite
favourable support from North American and European progressives,
Nicaragua's government does not. The reason for this conundrum is
that progressive opinion in the US, Canada and Europe takes its lead
from former FSLN leaders who split from the FSLN. To destabilize the
FSLN government, these former revolutionary leaders now work closely with
Nicaraguan right-wing and social democrat politicians. These in their
turn receive substantial financial and political support from the US
government and its European allies. If progressive arguments about Nicaragua's
politics are contested, convoluted and fierce, it is because lines of
political definition have got confused &#8211; a tactic typical of
right-wing propaganda warfare.</p>
