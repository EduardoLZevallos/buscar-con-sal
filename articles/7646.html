<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><em><strong>The overwhelming majority of government speakers at the 80th United Nations General Assembly this week defended peace. They demanded cooperation, mutual respect and dialogue between nations. In contrast, the representatives of the collective West defended their usual arrogant, overbearing positions and policies, although they clearly violate the fundamental principles of the UN of self-determination of peoples, non-aggression and non-intervention. US President Donald Trump once again showed himself to be a malevolent ignoramus with a sense of Yankee superiority derived from the odious cult of Manifest Destiny and an illusion of invincibility hangover from end of the Cold War.</strong></em></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left">In a recent interview, the prominent economist Michael Hudson observed that in 1945 the Western powers rescued fascism in the very moment they defeated it. In 1943, the philosopher Simone Weil had denounced that the European fascism of that time simply applied in countries with white populations the same colonial methods of conquest and domination used against the peoples of the majority world. Thus, renewed contemporary Western fascism not only has its origins in the terrible crimes of European and US genocide and slavery but was reinforced in 1945 by the recruitment of large numbers of functionaries and military from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to help future Western aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left">One has to remember this history in order to understand the apparent contradiction of contemporary fascism, deployed now by the same Western powers that defeated German, Italian and Japanese fascism in 1945. Since that moment, under the pretext of anti-communism, the US government and its allies supported bloody dictatorships all over the world and carried out coups against sovereign independent governments from Iran to Guatemala, from Congo to Ghana, from Indonesia to Chile. To defend their racist system of global domination, they unleashed terrible wars, one after another in Korea, in Algeria, in Vietnam with millions of civilian deaths.</p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left">Now, the fascist elites of the collective West facilitate the Zionist genocide of the Palestinian people and the criminal Zionist attacks on tens of thousands of civilians in Lebanon. They facilitate similar criminal smaller-scale attacks against the civilian population in Russia by the Nazi sympathizer regime in Ukraine. Now, too, the Yankee government is threatening to bomb Venezuela under the pretext of attacking sources of drug production and the narcotics trade. It is merely one more big lie, constantly repeated in the typical style of fascist governments determined to attack another people and government that resists their greed.</p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left">In the midst of everything, genocide, aggression, harassment, more and more governments of the countries of the majority world are willing to denounce the criminality of the collective West which, apart from its support for the Zionist genocide in Palestine, is also evident in the continuation of its support for NATO’s war against Russia on the territory of Ukraine. In addition, there is less and less tolerance in the majority world for the constant abuse by Western governments of tariffs and unilateral coercive measures as repressive tools of blackmail and coercion. The intense and constant psychological warfare of the Western media against governments and leaders who defend the sovereignty and national dignity of their nations is no longer convincing.</p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left">In the case of Cuba, practically the whole world continues to denounce the injustice of the genocidal Yankee blockade and recognizes the solidarity inspired love and the unparalleled humanitarian practice of the Cuban Revolution. Everyone sees that the collective West aspires to steal Venezuela's fabulous natural resources and also covets control of Nicaragua's strategic location in the heart of the Central American isthmus. Even social democratic governments, such as Brazil, Colombia or Mexico, have been attacked economically for defending their national interests and undertaking processes of truly democratic transformation.</p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left">The fascist aggression of the collective West and its allies reflects the class war unleashed by the Western ruling elites against their own populations. Since the end of the Cold War these elites have acted to eliminate trade unions, cut the rights to health, education and welfare and have made huge transfers of wealth to themselves through repeated financial bailouts at the cost of taxpayers. But, at the international level, the elites are finding it increasingly difficult to sustain their historical extortionist practices due to the growing global influence of China and Russia and the development of genuinely multilateral organizations such as BRICS+ and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.</p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%">The attempts of President Trump's administration to coerce the government of India, increasing tariffs and applying coercive measures against the use of the Chabahar port jointly managed by India and Iran, seem to have categorically failed. The proliferation of new trade routes throughout the Eurasian region makes the traditional routes through the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca much less important. At the domestic level, the neoliberal policies applied by their governments have destroyed the productive capacity of the economies of the North American and European countries. In important technological sectors, such as green and electric vehicle technologies, Western countries are unable to compete with their Asian business rivals.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%">The fascist Western ruling elites have repeatedly demonstrated that they will not tolerate, without a violent aggressive reaction, the successful development of independent countries defending their sovereignty. They have demonstrated it against Russia and Iran, against Democratic Korea and China, against Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. At the moment, it remains to be seen whether the aggressive Yankee military harassment against Venezuela will actually lead to all out war. However, in Latin America, another reason for the aggressive regional policy of the North American government is indicated in the promise of the Trump administration of unconditional support to support the Argentine economy.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%">The corrupt neoliberal policies of the fascist elite in Argentina have collapsed the country’s public finances. The output of industries such as construction and manufacturing have fallen to the levels of 2020 during the drastic economic slowdown caused by COVID-19 measures. The country's GDP has contracted by more than 3% since the seizure of power by President Milei and his accomplices. So, just weeks before important legislative elections in Argentina and a presidential vote in Chile, the supposed flagship model of neoliberal fascism in the region has completely failed.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%">On the other hand, the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela has overcome a decade of ruthless economic aggression by the collective West comparable only to the blockade of the Cuban Revolution by the US government. Venezuela is practically self-sufficient in food production, and continues to guarantee millions of social housing units for its population. Its national economic activity continues to recover rapidly with more than four years of constant GDP growth, currently estimated at more than 6% for the current year, with a sustained recovery in oil production.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%">In Cuba this month, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez revealed the latest figures on the damage caused by the more than sixty-year-old U.S. blockade. Now the total cost to Cuba’s society and economy adds up to a total of more than US$2.1 trillion. Even in the face of this unprecedented ruthless economic aggression, Cuba continues to guarantee its people health and education among the best in the world. Similarly, the Sandinista Revolution has guaranteed Nicaragua’s people the best health care system, the best road system, the greatest citizen security and the most innovative education system in all of Central America.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%">The successful overcoming by our respective revolutionary countries of the economic aggression imposed by successive US governments, with the complicity of their European allies, highlights the revolutionary focus of our countries on the development of the human person and our governments’ commitment to ensure the flourishing of the potential of all our countries’ families, without excluding anyone. It also demonstrates the indispensable cooperation of world powers such as China, Russia and Iran that recognize the value of our countries as exemplary revolutionary allies in promoting a true democratization of international relations based on solidarity, the tenderness between peoples.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%">These relations are expressed in the constant strengthening of infrastructure of all kinds, international diplomatic support, defense and security capabilities and cutting-edge medical technology. As our Co-President Rosario has said “International Solidarity is not only a Duty, it is a Right and a reality that advances, in a World advancing against the enemies of Peace, against the enemies of Solidarity, of Fraternity... those who are trying to continue destroying the World, and to continue capitalizing on the Patrimonies that belong to the Peoples of the World... Peoples on Paths of Glory, of Victories, of Liberation.”</span></p>
