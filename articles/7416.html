<p><b>2025-09-01 19:24 </b></p>

<p><b><i>The leaders of the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as the "SCO") held a meeting of the Council of Heads of State in Tianjin, China on September 1, 2025, and issued the following Declaration: </i><i> </i></b></p>

<p><b>One</b></p>

<p>The world's political and economic landscape, as well as other areas of international relations, are undergoing profound historic changes. The international system is evolving toward a more just, equitable, and representative multipolar world, opening up new prospects for national development and mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>

<p>At the same time, intensifying geopolitical confrontation poses threats and challenges to global and SCO regional security and stability. The global economy, particularly international trade and financial markets, has suffered severe shocks.</p>

<p>2025 marks the 80th anniversary of victory in World War II and the founding of the United Nations.</p>

<p>The great victory of peace-loving nations united against Nazism, fascism, and militarism determined the course of world history and created conditions for a stable international relations system that safeguards the peaceful development of humanity. Member States call on us to remember the heroic deeds of the peoples of all countries and the historical lessons of World War II.</p>

<p>As a unique intergovernmental organization, the United Nations has carried out effective work to maintain peace and security, promote economic and social development, and safeguard human rights, and has promoted necessary cooperation. Member States reaffirmed their commitment to upholding the UN Charter and other universally recognized principles of international law, respecting the diversity of civilizations, and pursuing equal and mutually beneficial cooperation, giving full play to the central coordinating role of the United Nations to build a more representative, democratic and just multipolar world.</p>

<p>The "Statement of the Council of Heads of State of the SCO Member States on the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Second World War and the Founding of the United Nations" was issued.

<p>Member States reaffirmed the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of human rights, respected human rights and fundamental freedoms, opposed double standards on human rights issues and opposed interference in the internal affairs of other States under the pretext of protecting human rights.</p>

<p>In order to further improve the construction of the SCO and ensure peace, stability, development and prosperity in the SCO region, member states approved the "SCO Development Strategy for the Next 10 Years (2026-2035)" and identified the priority tasks and main directions for deepening all- round cooperation. <b> </b></p>

<p>Cooperation-2024" (July 19, 2024, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China), and reiterated that they would continue to take joint actions aimed at strengthening SCO cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism.</p>

<p>Member States will continue to work together to prevent the spread of radical ideologies, religious intolerance, xenophobia, violent nationalism, and racial and ethnic discrimination. To implement the SCO Convention on Countering Extremism (Astana, June 9, 2017), the member states adopted the "SCO Member States Cooperation Framework for Countering Extremist Ideology 2026-2030."</p>

<p>Member States noted that the only way to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East is a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestinian issue.</p>

<p>Member States strongly condemned the military aggression launched by Israel and the United States against Iran in June 2025. Such aggressive acts against civilian facilities such as basic nuclear facilities have caused civilian casualties, seriously violated the norms of international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, infringed upon Iran's sovereignty and territorial integrity, undermined regional and international security, and had serious consequences for global peace and stability.</p>

To this end, they reiterated their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the current situation through diplomatic efforts.</p>

<p>Member States reaffirmed the importance and binding nature of UN Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015), which should be fully implemented in accordance with its provisions. Any attempt to arbitrarily distort the resolution will undermine the authority of the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>Member States support further deepening of practical cooperation in the field of drug control, including combating crimes using information and communication technologies and the spread of new psychoactive substances, and emphasize the importance of implementing the three UN international drug control conventions and relevant SCO legal documents in the field of drug control.</p>

They emphasize that the peaceful research, production, and use of nuclear energy are the inalienable rights of all states, and that equal, sustainable, and mutually beneficial international cooperation should be conducted without discrimination. The member states emphasize that the implementation of unilateral restrictive measures in this area violates international law and is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Member States support the prevention of the weaponization of outer space and believe that it is crucial to strictly adhere to the existing legal system for the peaceful use of outer space.

<p>Member States called on all States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention to fully implement the Convention, making it an effective legal instrument in the field of disarmament and non- proliferation. Member States reaffirmed their support for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), supporting its ability to resolve internal disagreements through consultation and decision-making, and ensuring the effective conduct of its work in accordance with the Convention. Given the completion of the destruction of declared chemical weapons stockpiles, all parties emphasized the importance of continuing to advance the Organization's work, which serves the interests of all States Parties to the Convention and is of great practical significance. All parties supported expanding the number of States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>

To this end, they supported the continued development of universally accepted international information security rules within the UN framework on a voluntary basis, and called for joint efforts to promote the signing of the United Nations Convention on Cybercrime and improve mechanisms to combat cybercrime.</p>

<p>Member States reiterated their willingness to further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the legal and judicial fields and supported the further implementation of the Agreement on Cooperation between the Ministries of Justice of the SCO Member States (Dushanbe, August 18, 2015).</p>
