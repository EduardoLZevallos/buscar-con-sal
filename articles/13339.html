<p><strong>INTERVENTION OF THE DELEGATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY<br />
OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA IN THE 51st GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE OAS</strong></p>

<p><strong>FOURTH PLENARY SESSION - NICARAGUA<br />
<br />
GUATEMALA, HYBRID FORMAT<br />
<br />
NOVEMBER 12, 2021</strong></p>

<p>Honorable Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Delegates of the 51st Session of the OAS General Assembly.</p>

<p>Honorable Authorities of the Member States and Governments of Our America.</p>

<p>Secretary General and Deputy Secretary General,<br />
<br />
Our Country has just finished one of the most beautiful tasks it has undertaken in recent years. This beautiful task not only required a lot of work, preparation, organization, resources and dedication of the various institutions, but above all, THE WILL AND DECISION OF A PEOPLE, who have shouted from the 4 winds, that they want to Live in Peace, work in Harmony and reaffirm UNITY, as an essential premise for Life itself.  <br />
 <br />
Our recently concluded electoral process, in which the democratic and civic spirit of all Nicaraguans was revealed, demonstrated, as we have said previously in different sessions of the Permanent Council of this OAS, that the Nicaraguan Society has embarked on a path of no return towards Democracy, actively participating from the initial bases that cemented this colossal effort.</p>

<p>It is already known that the Political Parties, from the beginning, participated in the formation of ALL THE ELECTORAL STRUCTURES OF OUR COUNTRY, as established by the laws and the Constitution of the Republic. The main actors were also consulted and participated in the debate on the legal framework that regulates the elections. No Party refrained from proposing members in the electoral structures, and all of them were able to accredit their monitors and delegates, all of whom were present at the Vote Stations, before, during and after the voting process and have verified the scrutiny of the votes and the transfer of materials and results, to the various counting centers, for their proper registration.  </p>

<p>Honorable Delegates,</p>

<p>NO ACT OR INCIDENT OF PROTEST OCCURRED, no act of physical aggression or limitation of the actions of any delegate of the Political Parties. No candidate registered by the parties was attacked or limited during their campaigns. A WORK OF TOLERANCE AND RESPECT, is, was and will continue to be a constant of a People like ours, which knows War, and therefore, treasures Peace, as a fundamental good, for Life.</p>

<p>The data is already known. More than 65% of the citizens participated in the national elections, through a civil structure that organized the logistical work of the Supreme Electoral Council, with just over 250,000 people, in order to guarantee that Nicaraguans could vote in Peace, Transparency and Tranquility. NOBODY CAN DENY THIS, ABSOLUTELY NOBODY! Unless, he has an interest in justifying, proposing or committing unworthy acts of aggression against our country.<br />
 <br />
Recently we clearly revealed the events that are planned and developed against our country, and we have energetically denounced those responsible for these attacks. We have shown evidence, motives, causes and methods used, from media malice, to the financing of terrorist groups, all used for aggressive purposes.<br />
 <br />
Ladies and Gentlemen. The point under discussion today is one of the least eloquent contradictions that can be known. There is NO possible way to deny that the majority of the Nicaraguan People clearly and decisively expressed their desire and will!<br />
 <br />
Any of the almost three million Nicaraguans who attended to vote, and who saw themselves through the media and in the streets surrounding the more than 3,000 voting centers and above all, the more than 75,000 prosecutors from Political Parties, can certify this unquestionable truth. We all expected the elections to take place in Peace, and that is how they were carried out. IN TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE PEACE.</p>

<p>Each of you can wonder about the state of mind of the Nicaraguans who ratified President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo. We are encouraged, happy, confident and eager to continue working even more, for Our Nicaragua.<br />
 <br />
But it is also possible to observe the almost 600,000 compatriots who opted for other political alternatives and who respect the results; they also join us to work for Nicaragua.<br />
 <br />
It is not just civic awareness, Mr. President, it is a Vision of Peace and Nationhood, a sense of Nicaraguan Identity.<br />
 We regret that the authorities of some countries in our region, try to blatantly deny the truth, and adhere to scripts and campaigns that seek to undermine the legitimate rights of the Nicaraguan People, who sovereignly elected their authorities, and persist in proposing documents, which from their very early stages, Our People have declared unacceptable.<br />
 <br />
Almost three million Nicaraguans have sent a very clear message that what we want is WORK AND PEACE, RESPECT AND UNITY, FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION, SOVEREIGNTY AND SELF-DETERMINATION.<br />
 <br />
Nicaragua has exercised, exercises and will continue to exercise sovereignly its Rights within the framework of the Laws and Standards of Life of our Peoples. That is why today we come to share our joy at the recent election of our authorities, in a peaceful and transparent manner; but also to demand firmly and vehemently, RESPECT FOR OUR NATION.  <br />
 <br />
The OAS is not our SUPREME ELECTORAL COUNCIL, the OAS does not have the authority to constitute our VOTING STATIONS, OAS officials are not and should not be POLITICAL PARTY MONITORS, the OAS is not an Arbitrator or Auditor of the Electoral Process; each nation establishes these authorities through its laws. When the goal has been to impose the opposite, history has been dramatically painful.  <br />
 <br />
On other occasions we have emphatically expressed our criteria regarding the so-called “recommendations” of the OAS, on schemes for holding elections. We have referred to the dangerous discretions that can be involved, when a foreign official or representative wants to limit, judge or impose a foreign vision on a Country. Therefore, we demand that they be respectful and refrain from describing an electoral process that is typical of our People and that was overseen by more than 200 international and 9,000 national companions and covered by more than 626 independent national and foreign journalists; certified by more than 75,000 political party monitors; but above all, it was celebrated by almost 3 million Nicaraguans. OUR COUNTRY HAS DEMONSTRATED RESPECT AND THEREFORE DEMANDS RESPECT.   <br />
 <br />
It is not the lie or the repeated aggression, like the one we hear today, it is not the lying platform of terrorist campaigns, of actors on the payroll of foreign governments that will mark our actions; this just does not fit, nor should it be reflected in any of the documents of an organization like this one, which should refrain from gross interference, because with this, it refuses to recognize the obvious truth of all Nicaraguans. The truths that are reliably evident in our country and that sustain our Voice and Our Demands.<br />
 <br />
Our people are already preparing actions, tasks and plans to undertake new struggles, more ambitious goals for the future and with Energy and Faith in our Most High God. Our Confidence is based on the clarity of our Objectives: Fighting Against Poverty; Promoting equitable participation and expanding economic growth to benefit rural families, giving priority to women, youth, Indigenous and Afro-descendant Peoples, Professionals and Workers; to all sectors of our diverse society, maintaining citizen security and living in Peace, Democracy and Development.<br />
Foreign Ministers and Delegates to this 51st OAS Ordinary Session,</p>

<p>Our Country consistently practices a Policy of Peace, Respect and Compliance in Good Faith with the commitments that derive from Treaties, Agreements and Decisions validly adopted, and in which our Country participates. A very clear and recent example of this is the signing of the Border Delimitation Decrees between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Fonseca. This Treaty is adopted as an expression of compliance with the Rulings of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, on different dates. On October 27, 2021, at the Binational meeting between the Sister Republics of Nicaragua and Honduras, the President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega Saavedra stated: “This is a step in which we are contributing to the strengthening of the International Court of Justice, which is the instrument that nations have to resolve conflicts. This signature is a contribution to Peace."<br />
 <br />
Nicaragua complies with its commitments and therefore demands, with the same firmness that others also comply with the Principles of Respect for National Sovereignty, Non-interventionism in the Internal Affairs of States and Self-determination of their Peoples.<br />
 <br />
In this session of the 51st General Assembly of the OAS, we demand respect for our Right to Live in Peace, since the work and daily effort of Nicaraguan families constitute our beacon of light, our spearhead, to continue advancing.<br />
 <br />
May the credibility of this organization not continue to be deteriorated and may the objectives of this OAS body, supposedly created to defend and promote the Sovereignty of the Peoples of America, never be forgotten.<br />
 <br />
NICARAGUA HAS THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE. FROM NICARAGUA, LAND OF ANDRÉS CASTRO, DARÍO, ZELEDÓN AND SANDINO.<br />
 <br />
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. PRESIDENT.</p>
