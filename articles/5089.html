<p><strong>Sao Paulo Forum Supports Nicaragua’s Sovereignty</strong><br />
Delegates at the Sao Paulo Forum in Brazil passed a resolution demanding respect for national sovereignty as they offered solidarity and support to Nicaragua’s Sandinista government. The resolution congratulated President Daniel Ortega and the people of Nicaragua for defeating the attempted coup “perpetrated by US imperialism through its lackeys” and welcomed the efforts to consolidate peace. A statement from the forum expressed “solidarity with Nicaragua and its Sandinista revolution against the interventionist actions of the Donald Trump government in the internal affairs of that country,” which the group said included sanctions and threatening statements.</p>

<p>The summit praised the government for its achievements in reducing social inequality and poverty through impressive economic growth, which was threatened by the instability created during the attempted coup period. “We stand in defence of the institutions, sovereignty and self-determination of the people. We demand respect for the legitimately elected government presided over by Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra,” the statement said, going on to denounce two items of US legislation “which violate the sovereignty of the people, in order to impose the interests of the United States. “We insist on the need for peace and reconciliation for the development and solution of political problems,” the statement concluded. (Morning Star, Dec. 10)</p>

<p><strong>More than 1,000 Prisoners Will Spend Christmas and New Year’s Day with Their Families</strong><br />
More than a thousand prisoners will enjoy family visits during the holidays. “The Government continues promoting the family unit and social reintegration for more than a thousand prisoners who will be granted the legal benefit of family coexistence in this month of December,” said Minister of the Interior María Amelia Coronel, during the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The prisoners will be delivered to their families as demonstrations of Christmas and New Year’s joy, she said. (Radio La Primerisima, 12/11/18)</p>

<p><strong>2019 Budget Will Include Much Social and Infrastructure Investment</strong><br />
The 2019 General Budget will include a series of multi-million dollar investments in infrastructure projects. (See next article.) In 2019, investment in social services is projected to be US$1.4 billion, which represents more than half of expenditures (56.2%), and 10.2% of Gross Domestic Product. The public investment program foreseen for 2019 is US$790.2 million and includes logistics (roads and ports); energy US$28.68 million; water and sanitation US$103.4 million; education and health US$560.5 million; and safety and justice, US$329.9 million. The subsidies for urban public transportation (a bus ride costs less than 8 US cents), electricity, school meals, free health and education are guaranteed. (Informe Pastran, 12/10/18)</p>

<p><strong>Building and Improving Roads, Bridges, and Ports to Continue in 2019</strong><br />
Retired General Oscar Mojica, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure (MTI), announced that multiple roads are near completion and others will be built in 2019. Some of them are: El Rama to Laguna de Perlas on the east coast, as well as Nueva Guinea to Bluefields, where a port is planned with the Dutch, finally connecting the east and west coasts of Nicaragua. A number of roads are being expanded to four lanes: The road from Managua to Tipitapa (Carretera Norte), from Ciudad Sandino to La Paz Centro, (road to Leon), Sapoa to Penas Blancas at the border to Costa Rica, from the new Piedrecitas overpass in west Managua to El Crucero, Diriamba and Jinotepe to Nandaime, all on the Carretera Sur. Nicaragua is already considered to have the best roads in Central America.</p>

<p>Several stretches on the way to Puerto Cabezas/Bilwi on the northeast coast, which have been notorious mega mud holes, like Mulukuku to Siuna, are almost finished; this will greatly reduce travel time which has been 24 hours. Several new bridges have and will be built with help from Japan. Connecting roads to places which have been inaccessible such as La Libertad to El Ayote in Chontales, Granada to Malacatoya, Esteli to San Juan de Limay, Pantasma to Wiwili in Jinotega, Cardenas to Colon on the south shore of Lake Cocibolca, and Potosi to El Carmen on the Gulf of Fonseca. (Adolfo Pastran Program, 12/10/18)</p>

<p><strong>More Evidence Revealed Against Those Who Headed up Roadblocks in Jinotepe</strong><br />
December 10 there was a another session in the trial of defendants Félix Picado, Juan Ramón Medina, Cristian Berma Cruz, Matilde Blandón, Joel Blandón Villagra, Yader Blandón Villagra; Johny Leiva Castro, Juan José Medina and Orlando Granado, who are being accused by the Public Prosecutor of terrorist acts carried out in Jinotepe. These subjects commanded one of the most violent roadblocks in this area. They are accused of murdering Pablo Israel Ramo whose body was also burned.</p>

<p>The witnesses at the trial recognized the defendants who carried military-use weaponry and held hostages at the roadblocks. The Public Ministry introduced a video where the witnesses stated that they recognized the presence of the accused on the day of the murder of Israel Ramo. They said the defendants called a unit of the Nicaraguan Red Cross to attempt to exchange the body of Ramo for a crony who was hospitalized. (Canal 8, 12/11/18)</p>

<p><strong>Forbes describes Little Corn Island as one of the Best Beaches to Discover in 2019</strong><br />
An article published last Thursday in Forbes Magazine ranks Little Corn Island among the Best Beaches to Visit in 2019. “This wonderful Nicaraguan island is the best kept secret in the Caribbean and is the perfect destination for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city,” the Forbes Magazine report states.

<p><strong>More Witnesses Describe Atrocities Committed at Masaya Roadblocks </strong><br />
Last Thursday the trial continued of Cristian Fajardo, Santiago Adrián Fajardo Baldizón and María Adilia Peralta, accused of the crimes of terrorism, financing of terrorism, organized crime, obstruction of public services and kidnapping. These subjects were in charge of the roadblocks located in the city of Masaya, where along with extortion, the group directed by them carried out assaults, looting, destruction and burning of many private and public buildings in Masaya including the craft market and a large secondary school. They attacked the police station daily. Santiago Fajardo and his brother Cristian Fajardo were recognized as the operation chiefs. They were in charge of paying the delinquents in Masaya. At least nine witnesses are expected to give declarations including those who were beaten, tortured, bound, kidnapped and terrorized.</p>

<p>The first witness was a Police agent who patrolled incognito in Masaya and did not carry identification, but a companion with whom he traveled by motorcycle did carry identification. At one of the roadblocks they were detained and tortured to find the document. The police agent who testified in this session recognized the Fajardo brothers. The Police agent said “They had a dispute with the terrorist leaders in Monimbó because they were fighting over who was best at capturing police or Sandinistas.  So because of that they did not take us to Monimbó, but they took us to a place that they called ‘the station.’ They beat us, tied our hands and put us on a pulley; then the Fajardo brothers arrived and that’s where they said ‘open the way, there’s the boss – Chago (Santiago Fajardo)’. He grabbed a gun, fired it, then he made me play roulette”, the victim affirmed. So far, three of the nine witnesses have given testimony. (Canal 8, 12/6/18)</p>

<p><strong>Trial Begins of the Heads of the Criminal Roadblocks in Carazo</strong><br />
December 6 the trial began of Tomás Maldonado and Carlos Brenes, accused of the crimes of terrorism, organized crime, obstruction of public services and aggravated damage.  Seven key witnesses were presented who claim that these two people were the main instigators of hate, and who directed the attacks and controlled the roadblocks in Carazo. The first witness was Senior Commissioner Pedro Rodríguez Argueta, who was assigned to the police delegation in the city of Jinotepe, where he says the accused were the main promoters of violence and those who armed others involved in roadblock-related violence.</p>

<p>This commissioner was wounded with a .22 shot, which broke his left hand. He also received an AK rifle bullet in the left chest; thanks to his bulletproof vest and a rosary that was in his shirt pocket, he wasn’t killed but he did lose consciousness. “Tomás Maldonado, Joao Maldonado and his son, Carlos Brenes, among others, were the ones who carried arms and coordinated all the movement in the area,” the police chief said. “Tomás Maldonado is the one who ran this group together with Carlos Brenes, they prepared the conditions and planned the criminal acts, created and ran the roadblocks in Jinotepe, as well as attacks on public institutions, looting of commercial establishments to get money to buy arms and ammunition.” They are also linked to the burning and destruction of the Jinotepe police station. The trial will continue in the coming days. (Canal 8 12/6/18)</p>

<p><strong>Families and Victims of the Coup Denounce “Journalist” Miguel Mora</strong><br />
Relatives of those murdered and tortured during the attempted coup, denounced Miguel Mora, head of 100% News to the Public Prosecutor. They claim he incited violence and hatred that caused torture and death.</p>

<p>Francisca Méndez, denounced Mora for encouraging torture and killing. She is the daughter of Guillermo Méndez Ortiz who was tortured and murdered at the roadblocks in Jinotepe, Carazo, on June 12, 2018. “I accuse the inciter of hatred, Miguel Mora, who promoted and continues to promote the death-roadblocks, where they kidnapped and tortured my father. That is why I have come to file a complaint, so that justice is done and this does not go unpunished, so that they do not continue to kill innocent people and so that this gentleman does not continue to harm the country.”</p>

<p>Also present was Mirlehn Méndez Ventura, wife of Bismarck Martínez, kidnapped on June 29.</p>

<p>“To date we have not found my husband, and Miguel Mora is aware of this, because he talks about the roadblocks and Bismarck was kidnapped at one. I demand Mora tell us the whereabouts of my husband.”</p>

<p>Henry Serrano: “I was intercepted at the San José school, where they grabbed me, hooded me, kidnapped and assaulted me for four days, beat me, broke me and fractured my nose, violated my physical integrity and that of my family, all because of Mora who incites people to attack the Sandinistas.” Serrano, an inhabitant of the Ana Virgen Noble neighborhood of Jinotepe, says when he was kidnapped, they used his credit card to charge money in San José, money stolen along with his phone and other belongings.</p>

<p>Erasmo Hernandez Palacios, who was also kidnapped and tortured in Jinotepe placed a complaint against Miguel Mora. He was threatened with death for being a Sandinista.</p>

<p>Roberto Rodríguez accused Mora of kidnapping, burning his vehicle and destroying his home. “I accuse Mr. Mora of the destruction of my vehicle and what I ask for is justice and peace for the Nicaraguans, for that reason I demand you close down 100% Noticias. On June 12, Rodriguez was kidnapped at 10:50 am: “It was a very difficult situation for me. On June 31 at 2:00 a.m., they burned my vehicle.”</p>

<p>Róger Escobar filed a complaint for terrorism, damage to his family, private property damage and robbery. “They terrorized my family because of the manipulation of Miguel Mora who said I was a paramilitary, they damaged my image and I received threats.” He had to spend 3 months outside his home because of threats to him on 100% Noticias and social media.</p>

<p>Auxiliadora Sotelo Robleto, blames Miguel Mora, for encouraging criminals who robbed her home on June 16 in the Ayapal neighborhood. “That man only lies and manipulates. They left me on the street. Eighty criminals ransacked my home and took money, computers, cell phones and jewelry. Eight days later they returned to my house and, in stolen vans from the Ministry of Health, took everything and left my house empty, but I was hospitalized and the only ones there were my children and my grandson.”</p>

<p>Carla Teresa Torres Hernández gave more evidence implicating Miguel Mora in the death of her husband, policeman Gabriel de Jesús Vado.  Last week, Ms. Torres made the complaint to the Public Ministry, but this Monday she provided videos and audios, showing that her husband was killed at a roadblock, in addition to threats made by Miguel Mora to her husband on video.
