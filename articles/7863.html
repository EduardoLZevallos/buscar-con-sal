<p><strong>NICARAGUA WITH CUBA ALWAYS</strong></p>

<p>General Assembly, United Nations<br />
New York, October 29th 2025</p>

<p>Madam President,</p>

<p>1. We associate ourselves with the Statements made by the Representative of Iraq on behalf of the G77+China, Uganda on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and Venezuela on behalf of the Group of Friends in Defense of the United Nations Charter.</p>

<p>2. We greet and thank the presence of Brother, Compañero Bruno Rodríguez, Foreign Minister of Cuba and his distinguished Delegation; to whom we express our fraternal greeting and recognition for their courage and tireless spirit of Struggle and Victories.</p>

<p>3.    We deeply appreciate the information shared by your delegation, as it highlights the serious damages and challenges that the beloved and heroic People of Cuba continues to face.</p>

<p>Madam President,</p>

<p>4. The imposition practiced by the imperial power, full of arrogance, erodes the confidence of the world’s Peoples in the multilateral system and distorts the role of the United Nations. It is time to break with the unipolar logic and to raise with firmness and dignity in a principled way the sovereign voice of the Peoples who forge this new multipolar world.</p>

<p>5. The world’s Peoples are consolidating their path towards the already evident multipolar order, weaving more just, solidarity inspired alliances, based on full respect for the sovereignty of States and decisively challenging the remnants of imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism, which still seek to impose themselves against the will of all free Peoples.</p>

<p>6.    Continuing to impose, promote and apply illegal unilateral coercive measures, economic, political or of any kind, constitutes flagrant violation of International law, humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>7.    It is unacceptable and shameful that some States persist in these inhuman, illegal arbitrary and selective measures, aggressions that are weapons of blackmail and punishment against dignified and independent Peoples.</p>

<p>8. We denounce these practices, which are incompatible with the Charter of the United Nations and violate the sovereignty, self-determination and the right to development of the worlds’ peoples.</p>

<p>Madam President,</p>

<p>9. Year after year in this Assembly we call in unison for one of the most prolonged, cruel and anachronistic injustices of our time be put to an end once and for all.</p>

<p>10. The criminal economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States on Cuba for more than six decades has been the main instrument of an anachronistic policy of extreme aggression, designed to subjugate the Cuban people, causing pain and suffering in the lives of its citizens, suffocating its economy, seeking to bring about a change of government, in a sovereign people, which never bows to the designs of the empire.</p>

<p>11.    This blockade is a deliberate act of economic warfare, a collective punishment that massively violates the human rights of an entire nation, it is a blatant and absolute abuse against the life, health, food, education, the right to development and self-determination, of that generous and solidarity inspired People, namely our Cuban brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>12.    Every day that passes, the devastating consequences of the blockade aggravate the situation of millions of Cubans in all areas, limiting Cuba's ability to access medicines, technologies, food and financial resources, affecting its productive potential, impacting on its sustainable development programs, and in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.</p>

<p>13. In the same context of harassment, the unjust and arbitrary inclusion of the sister Republic of Cuba in the infamous illegal list of the United States is added, falsely accusing it of sponsoring terrorism; a slander and aggression seeking to justify the unjustifiable. Cuba only sponsors life, cooperation and brother and sisterhood. That is the real list in which Cuba honourably participates.</p>

<p>14.    In the face of this aggression, Cuba's dignity stands as a beacon of resistance. Cuba is a giant of international solidarity, continuing to stand, solidly sharing education, health, science and hope with the Peoples of the world.</p>

<p>15.    Thousands upon thousands of Cuban doctors, teachers, engineers, athletes and professionals have brought health, education and sports to the most remote corners of the earth. Its medical brigades have always been the first to unconditionally assist in the face of natural disasters and epidemics, as the vast majority of the countries present here, including developed countries, know and thank Cuba writing in this way the most luminous pages of revolutionary internationalism and the Humanitarian Socialist essence of its Glorious Revolution.</p>

<p>Madam President,</p>

<p>16.    For 33 years, this Assembly has declared that the blockade against Cuba is unjustifiable and illegal, despite the attempts of the United States to cover it up with unfounded and interventionist arguments. Therefore, this Assembly also has an obligation to enforce all these resolutions.</p>

<p>17. Nicaragua is a living and grateful witness to this Cuban Solidarity. We condemn in the strongest terms this illegal, immoral and inhuman blockade imposed against Cuba and demand its immediate, total and unconditional end.</p>

<p>18.    The Peoples of the World, including that of the United States, demand an end to this Blockade, they are with Cuba, at its side, accompanying it, because solidarity is stronger than blackmail, because History and Justice will always be with the Peoples who do neither sell out nor surrender.</p>

<p>Madam President,</p>

<p>19. We are certain that international solidarity with Cuba will continue to grow as an expression of shared dignity. By adopting this resolution, the General Assembly will once again raise its voice in firm condemnation of this criminal economic war and all its manifestations and extraterritorial effects, which continue to intensify against the Sister Republic of Cuba.</p>

<p>20. Nicaragua, as every year, affirms its respect, admiration and eternal affection for Cuba and will vote in favour of draft resolution A/80/L.6, reiterating our support, recognition and gratitude to the beloved and generous People and Government of Cuba, whose heroism and example is faithful to its internationalist vocation, always ready to contribute with its experience to the common good of humanity.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF VOTE NICARAGUA<br />
AFTER THE VOTE</strong></p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>1.    At this moment when the Assembly has once again expressed its support for Cuba and for the 33rd consecutive time called for an immediate end to the United States blockade against Cuba, the world has witnessed this decisive solidarity with Cuba.</p>

<p>2. Alogn with everyone else, we have heard these grateful expressions of solidarity towards Cuba over these two days, especially those expressed by Iraq of the G77+China, Uganda by the Non-Aligned Movement and Eritrea by the Group of Friends in Defense of the Charter, Singapore on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN), Turkey for the countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Barbados for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Guinea-Bissau on behalf of the African Group.</p>

<p>3. The denunciation of this blockade against Cuba is universal, only the country that applies it was the sole country that tried to justify its own anachronistic policy.</p>

<p>4. Self-evident, as expressed throughout this debate, has been the universal support Cuba receives from the whole world and also that this criminal blockade is, in itself, the most serious, systematic and flagrant violation of the human rights of the Cuban People; likewise, the rejection by countries of the inclusion of Cuba in the illegal, unilateral list of state sponsors of terrorism.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>5. Nicaragua, by voting in favor of the resolution just adopted, reaffirms its unwavering solidarity with the heroic Cuban Revolution, with its Government and its People, an example of dignity, resistance and international solidarity.</p>

<p>6.    We reiterate that the only legitimate path is respectful dialogue, on the basis of sovereign equality, without conditions or threats.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>7. Finally, we wish to express our full solidarity with the peoples of our great Caribbean, Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and other Caribbean States that are currently facing the disastrous attacks caused by the meteorological phenomenon, Hurricane Melissa, our condolences to the families and governments for the loss of life.</p>

<p>8.    These constant tragedies, increasingly frequent and extreme, are the consequences of global warming and the climate crisis accelerated by the breach of the legally binding commitments of developed countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
