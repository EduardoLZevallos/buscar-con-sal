      <big><br>
TcS: We're just a few months away now from the municipal elections
in Nicaragua. What are the main challenges facing the Supreme Electoral
Council as you prepare for these elections?<br>
      <br>
RR : Unlike many countries in Latin America, Nicaragua's electoral
system is a separate power of the State and as such organizes the
elections. We don't outsource our work in any way except in the case of
transmitting the results, which we do with the company responsible for
communications in our country. We are dealing with two aspects. On the
one hand the political aspect which has to do with credibility and with
the behaviour of the political organizations and their political
alliances.<br>
      <br>
And on the other hand we have the organizational aspect. From the
organizational point of view I think there is no doubt, among
organizations, and they have said as much, including some of the
non-governmental organizations that criticize us every day, they have
said there is no doubting our capacity as an institution in the
technical organization of the electoral processes.<br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua there are no spoiled votes as we have seen in some Latin
American countries. In Nicaragua&nbsp; there is no loss of voting
documentation for the voting stations. Everything gets to where it is
intended to go. If such cases were to happen they would be perhaps one
or two out of 12,000. But up until now no such situation has happened.
So I think that the administrative side of things is completely under
control. The complicated part is the political aspect.<br>
      <br>
We are a very passionate country as regards politics. If you check out
newspapers from Canada to Chile you'll find newspapers carry coverage
of economics, social matters and politics. Nicaragua has 99.9 per cent
coverage of politics and 0.01 per cent coverage of other issues. In
that context, some people try to disqualify the electoral authority.
Those people are people I would describe as political failures. They
are individuals who have left their parties. <br>
      <br>
Some have left the Frente Sandinista, others have left the Liberal
Party, others have left the Conservative Party and some of these people
are ex-rectors of universities, some are former Sandinista government
officials. Now, today, they are the ones you see on the television
every day trying to influence opinion against Nicaragua's
institutionality. And logically, since the Supereme Electoral Council
is the authority that carries out those elections it finds itself
caught up in that struggle on a daily basis.<br>
      <br>
However, despite everything if you look at the opinion polls, even with
all their bias, because the scientific basis of their design has never
been published, you'll see that public approval of our institution is
at about 50 or 51 per cent. You will tell me that is very low for an
institution carrying out elections. That is so. But if you take into
account the bias, the people who don't take part in elections and a
series of other factors, in the end people do have confidence.<br>
      <br>
Why do I venture to affirm that? On the basis of the level of electoral
participation in Nicaragua. Nicaragua is one of the few countries in
the world with a high level of participation without compulsory voting.
Based on the total voter roll about 65% of voters participate in the
presidential elections, which given the real electoral roll - because
part of the roll is faulty, with people who have died, people outside
the country - that works out at 94 or 95 per cent. And in municipal
elections, like the ones coming up now, we at about 60% which
corresponds, given the real electoral roll, to about 85 or 90 per cent
participation.<br>
      <br>
TcS : In terms of the criticisms some people in the country have made
of the electoral roll, do you think the Council still has problems with
it or have they been overcome?<br>
      <br>
RR: Yes. but perhaps for these people it is rather too easy to
criticise, because they hardly even know what they are talking about.
Our electoral roll today has about 3.7 million citizens entitled to
vote, people over the age of 16. Here people vote at 16. Of those 3.7
million you have about a million citizens in Costa Rica. So those
people are not taking part in the electoral process and so the
electoral roll does not reflect that and we cannot disqualify them from
voting. There are about 200,000 deceased people, approximately,
individuals who have died and their relatives don't report them to us
as the law requires they should. We cannot remove these citizens.<br>
      <br>
But in real terms, the roll is a clean electoral roll because whoever
has an identity document that qualifies them to vote, who is a
Nicaraguan citizen registered as such with documentary support, that
makes the electoral roll work. As I explained it is not entirely clean. It
is an electoral roll that is not clean for the reasons I mentioned, but
not really one that does not meet the relevant requirements, I wouldn't
use the word minimal, but the international standards for an electoral
roll that qualifies citizens to vote. We cannot remove anyone form the
electoral roll here. There is a direct relationship between the
identity document and the electoral roll. An identity document cannot
be issued if the information system does not include it in the
electoral roll.<br>
      <br>
So these critisicms that people make, sometimes they don't even know
what they are talking about from a technical point of view. What can we
do in future? There is a simple way of cleaning up electoral rolls and
that is by issuing a new identity document. Obviously, these are
factors that in this area you can update for a year or for two years.
Because within two years if citizens fail to meet their legal
responsibilities, the electoral roll again has big problems.<br>
      <br>
We already have a programme in action for next year. We are ready to
issue a new identity document that has all the relevant security
components as required at globally. In accordance with the struggle
against terrrorism, against narcotics, against all this kind of evil
that affects humanity today. We have not wanted to implement it now so
as not to generate another complicating element into the elections.
Once the elections are over, we are going to begin the process of
renewing identity documents and at the same time clean up the electoral
roll that logically should give us an up to date roll.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : How do you view the recent process of voter verification that
took place recently?<br>
      <br>
RR : I think it was positive. For me I think it was an expense which
from the point of view of the country's poverty should not have been
made. Why do I say that? Because one of the very quick ways in which
one can update the electoral roll is on the self-same election day. And
we have just had an electoral process recently, the Presidential
elections of 2006, which left us an electoral roll&nbsp; that was
reasonably
clean. Nicaragua is one of the coutnries that has as a voting
characteristic that you can vote - I am referring to Latin America
where we are very suspicious of elections - you can vote if you do not
appear in the electoral roll of a voting station if you can demonstrate
that you live there. If you can show with two witnesses or a utility
bill, for electricity, water or telephone, that you live there and that
you are not in that electoral roll but have to be in the electoral roll
in some or other part of the country, you can carry out your right to
vote there. A registration is made of the citizen concerned and they
then stay registered in that electoral roll and logically have to be
removed from the other place in which they are registered.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I think this is a question of perceptions. The political parties are
highly mistrustful. I go to other elections as an observer. I observe
many elections in Latin America. I see things done that if you were to
do them in Nicaragua, everyone whould cry that you were committing
fraud. On what do people here base their mistrust? In Nicaragua there
were elections in '84, there were elections in '90, won by someone who
was not in the government, the Frente Sandinista did not win. There
were elections in 1996, the winner was not from the Frente. There were
elections in 2001, someone won who was not from the Frente. And as well
as those electoral processes there were the municipal elections. But
come the elections of 2006 where someone from the Frente wins and then
the elections are in doubt. There was no doubt as regards all the
others but that election one is encouraged to doubt.<br>
      <br>
If a political party that is not the Frente Sandinista wins a majority
of municipal authorities in municipal elections in Nicaragua then the
Council is to assume the elections were transparent. If the Frente
Sandinista wins a majority of municipal authorities then there will
have been fraud in the elections. For me, that kind of disparagement
does democracy a lot of damage. Sometimes these people are
irresponsible and don't realise the ill thay cause to the strengthening
or growth of democracy in Nicaragua.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : In terms of the Supreme Electoral Council's budget, do you think
you have enough resources to be able to carry out the elections
successfully this year?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : We don't really have the resources necessary to carry out high
quality elections, no. I want to be very clear when I say quality. That
has nothing to do with transparency, much less fraud. We say what
elections we have to carry out. It is our constitutional obligation to
carry out elections for a change of authorities. If we receive an
adequate budget then the elections will be of high quality. We will use
good quality paper, the voting boxes will be very well made. The inputs
we use, the transport arrangements, the communications arrangements.
Everything would be expedited. But if we receive a limited budget as in
the current case and it is a budget not provided by this government but
one inherited planned for three years, the budget for the Supreme
Electoral Council, with a great deal of malicious intent so as to
asphyxiate us economically. So the elections will be of lower quality
in terms of the inputs and mechanisms to be used, but not in terms of
the transparency of the results nor in respect of the popular will.<br>
      <br>
TcS : And how important for a successful election is the cooperation of
other powers fo the State, like the police or the army? How important
is their cooperation?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : For me it is very important. For me the natural partners in
organizing elections are the army, the police and, in this case, a
private company Enitel which manages communications in this country. I
think these are the three important partners of the electoral power in
Nicaragua to carry out the elections. In previous elections, in the
time of Dr. Alemán we could count on the support fo the
Executive. In
the time of President Bolaños there was not even minimal support.<br>
      <br>
So I have seen different elections. President Chamorro, President
Alemán and now President Ortega even more so, have given much
support
to the electoral power as they are bound to under the Constitution to
carry out elections.&nbsp; In the time of President Bolaños it
was more a
case of seeking to block the electoral system, seeking to asphyxiate
the electoral power so as not to carry out the elections.<br>
      <br>
So now again just as in the elections of '90, '96, 2001 and 2006, the
police and the army are helping the electoral authority with great
respect. They assist in transferring materials and personnel to areas
the civil power cannot get to because they have to be taken by
helicopter. Let's see what the politicians say now to the accustomed
support of the police and the army for these elections. Perhaps too
they will mistrust the army and the police.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : Can we look now at some points of specific criticisms that have
been made in recent months which have even been made internationally?
First they criticise the fact that elections in the Northern Atlantic
Coast region have been postponed. Can you talk a bit about why that
happened?<br>
      <br>
RR : There was a hurricane that provoked a human and material disaster
in the North Atlantic region that affected eight municipalities in the
area. But of those eight, three suffered much more than the others.
What was the effect? A great deal of movement in the electoral roll. So
basically, although we have the mechanism I mentioned to you before
that people can vote even if they are in the wrong voting station, this
is for exceptional cases not for whole municipalities for everyone to
vote in that way. So to guarantee a transparent election, with not the
least room for suspicion of fraud, the Council decided that the
conditions were not appropriate and so the elections were postponed.<br>
      <br>
What happened was that the politicians like to be in the game on a
daily basis. So here we were visited by a delegation of the executive
commission of the National Assembly, our parliament. They asked myself
and my colleagues to do an on-site inspection of the conditions
prevailing. We went and the truth is that we found that conditions did
not prevail for carrying out elections. Obviously the political
parties, some, not all, want to interpret things their way and some
thought it was some kind of trick on our part&nbsp; to try and
complicate
things, obtaining results other than the results they might expect at
that time. But one was dealing with something no more than an
absolutely technical matter.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We would have preferred the last Sunday of April, because that is a
time when it does not rain in Nicaragua. Our seasons are not like
yours, who have four well-defined seasons. In our case it either rains
or it does not. Here we have three or four months when it does not rain
so we wanted to take advantage of the last month in which it does not
do so, which is April, so as to be able to carry out better elections.
After a series of political negotiations in the National Assembly, it
was decided to postpone them but to carry them out on January 18th and
not at the end of April. Well, there are only two months between April
and January. Does that really help much? But I hope that we will be
able to do the impossible so that things work out OK in the North
Atlantic Region.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : And there are three municipalities there?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : Now it is a case of all the municipalities of the RAAN. We were
talking of three. They expanded it to all eight.<br>
      <br>
TcS : The Assembly...<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : The National Assembly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : Another point on which they have strongly criticised the Supreme
Electoral Council has been for the cancellation of the legal
personality of some small parties, for example the Movimiento Renovador
Sandinista and the Partido Conservador. Are these cases the same? Or
what are the circumstances in those cases?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : They are completely different. I have just got back from a meeting
today of the Inter-American Union of Electoral Organizations where all
the electoral bodies of Latin America took part and as it happens I was
explaining this case because the people there like to know these things
out of an interest in procedural hstory. The case of the MRS is
completely different to that of the Conservative Party.<br>
      <br>
The Movimiento Renovador Sandinista held a congress in February 2007.
And in that congress or convention it took the decision to replace all
the executive commissions at municipal and departmental level,
equivalent to US counties and states, and to name provisional
commissions in the 153 municipalities and the 17 departments
nationally. They told the Council two months later about this
situation. So the Council sent them correspondence saying "On the
resolutions of your congress, despite resulting from the action of your
own statutes" - since we have to supervise&nbsp; their compliance with
their
statutes - " you are not complying with what you yourselves resolved.
We are not going to say whether the results of your congress were
correct or not, only your compliance with its results, the targets that
you set for yourselves."<br>
      <br>
To this day we have yet to receive the names of the people making up
those commissions. I can tell you of thirteen departments in which they
don't exist. And where they do exist I can point out very specific
examples of individuals who even say they were not consulted before
they appeared in a provisional executive commission. In summary, they
did not meet their own rules despite having this drawn to their
attention officially month after month. They were told, they were
warned and they were notified again and again. They never put their
situation in order so a decision had to be taken and the decision was
what the law stipulates, namely to cancel the legal personality of that
party.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This is a case that is not closed. They have an appeal lodged with the
Supreme Court of Justice. Electoral decisions cannot be appealed once
the Council makes a resolution, except in the case of political parties
in relation to their legal personality. The appeal is with the Court.
If the Constitutional Division of the Supreme Court of Justice judges
that this party should again receive its legal personality we have no
other option but to do what the Supreme Court of Justice orders.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : With regard to the situation of the MRS, perhaps this is a
question you cannot answer but perhaps you could give your own opinion?
Would it be fair to describe the behaviour of the MRS faced with this
problem of compliance with the law as something deliberate, or is it
incompetence, or what&nbsp; might explain it?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : That is a question that we magistrates in charge of the matter
asked ourselves every day. Could it be intentional that they are
leading us to take a decision of that nature? Because everything
indicated, with all our formal legal warnings that they were quite
uninterested in complying with their own resolutions. It was not an
imposition of ours. But those are things on which I cannot offer an
opinion except that it was something we asked ourselves and, for me,
you have hit the target. It is an interesting question. Again , for us,
if the Court admits their appeal and rules in their favour we will
comply. I have no difficulty on that score and neither do my colleagues.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As for the Partido Conservador, the case is different. The law says
that to maintain legal personality a party needs to present candidates
in every electoral process in every election. In the municipal
elections they should put up candidates in at least 80% of the
municipalities, with 80% of possible candidates in each municipality.
The Partido Conservador presented their candidates with just barely 80%
of candidates. So then if one of their candidates died along the way,
things got complicated for them and in fact 500 of their candidates
resigned. And among the candidates were serving police officers which
the Constitution prohibits. Here the armed forces and the police can
vote but cannot stand for any office without resigning from service a
year previously.<br>
      <br>
And so they were asked to replace the 500 candidates that had resigned.
Only 101 replacements were received. There was no way. To date there is
still not. That requirement has not been made good. They have two
recourses. An appeal for review by ourselves that we have not received
yet in fact for the same reason, since there is incompliance with
regard to candidates, and an appeal lodged with the Supreme Court of
Justice. That is also pending. But again, if the Court rules in their
favour we will comply.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;TcS : The last of these criticisms that have been made so
consistently
of the Supreme Electoral Council has to do with election observers.
Recently the complaint has been made that bodies like IPADE and Etica y
Transparencia are not going to be permitted to be observers in this
year's municipal elections. Some people say the body that has been
accredited to observe the elctions in November is aligned with the
government. What do you think on this issue?<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;RR : There is an organization accredited which is CEELA the
Council of
Latin American Election Experts. These are people who have been
electoral magistrates, or presidents of electoral bodies, who have
carried out elections. We are talking about people who are experts. We
are not talking about people who spend their lives observing. but who
have sepnt their lives carrying out elections.&nbsp; A group of them
met
together, apparently on thir own initiative, some of them suggest it
was perhaps in the context of the organization of Latin American
electoral bodies. <br>
      <br>
They invited us as observers, since at the end of the day we are all
either ex-magistrates or magistrates in active service, all of
recognised prestige among the electoral tribunals. They asked this
Council if they could come and observe the elections, they offered
support with technical assitance and we have authorized them and said
to them fine, if they do things as they should be done. These are
people who are very respectful of the rules because they have had their
election processes observed. They are professionls. Most are academics,
rectors of universities. They work very well.<br>
      <br>
As for the others, we have not said that observers are not going to be
authorized. There are two requests. One from IPADE and one from Etica y
Transparencia. What has definitely been sought here is to generate
controversy on this score, but we have said that if they abide by the
law, respect the rules, then we are studying the matter and for me they
are likely to get their accreditation in due course. The collegiate
body will have to see. I think there will be no problems in that sense.
I think they will be accredited.<br>
      <br>
Even so, one day recently someone from Etica y Transparencia,
Señor
Robert Courtney specifically, at least from what I read in the media,
said that with or without accreditation they were going to send out
6000 observers. I have asked the communications media, "why are they
asking for accreditation if they are determined to observe either
way?"&nbsp; And there is also the suggestion that why don't the people
observe, that he had been to Bolivia and has seen in Bolivia that the
people observed and I suggest to him, would someone recognise a failing
simply because they were observing those elections? Does Señor
Courtney
even understand the Nicaraguan electoral process when its people
participates via its political parties who are all represented in the
voting stations? They participate as oversight officers. They
participate depositing their vote exercising their right to vote.<br>
      <br>
The law in Nicaragua demands that once voting is finished, oversight
officers representing the different parties are present for a count of
the votes deposited. A resolution confirming the votes is signed, a
copy of which has to be posted outside the voting station so that this
result can be compared with official announcements on the Council's web
site, or listened to or seen on the radio or TV so as to compare
whether the result from that voting station conforms to what the
Council is publishing. So the people as such does in some measure
participate.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I would say this is not a closed chapter. The Council is considering
this. The only thing we want is a commitment that things should proceed
according to the law. Yesterday, there was a resolution by all the
Latin American electoral bodies that took into account some elements
relating to election observation. Whether it be international or
national - and I already made this observation to you - it should
respect the legal framework of the countries where it is carried out,
as much the national one as the international one, that's secondary.
The principal thing is that observation shold be neutral and should not
be used as a mechanism for intervention so as to go and look at, or try
to get involved in, the internal affairs of a given country, it ought
to be made to work as a contribution to democracy.<br>
      <br>
And another element that the resolution touches on is to say that
observers should communicate with the electoral authority before making
known a given result. Why? Because you can come, say you are an
observer and give a report saying these people are committing a fraud
and base that on made up facts that are not the case. So that throws
doubt on the process, questions the electoral process and makes our
life more complicated. One has to be completely serious in these
matters and very careful not to use the funding these organizations
receive for training oversight officers, or voting station
representatives, for political parties. Because the Electoral Law has a
chapter on Electoral Offences which states that it is not possible to
receive funding from other States or from mixed bodies like the
International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute,
to be transferred to political parties. And one way of transferring
funds for that purpose is that one trains them, one calls them
observers and then hands them over to be oversight officers or members
of voting stations for the political parties.<br>
      <br>
We are saying that in this case, people will be authorized but they
must hand over a database of whoever they are training as observers and
we in accordance with the law will register them, and these individuals
cannot be registered as voting station representatives or oversight
officers. They will have to be registered as electoral observers, in
the voting station they want to observe. Here there is no problem for
the observers to work wherever they want to.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;TcS : But one supposes that complicates life for your staff if
they have to do all that extra work.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;RR : No. Because there is a management of the electoral roll
since we
have a national database. Logically for our own work&nbsp; and at the
same
time for being responsible for the national identity document and for
being the ones responsible for the central registry of births and
deaths. And that's quite interesting. here in Nicaragua you see
initiatives for laws in our parliament wanting to separate the identity
document from election procedures, wanting to separate the registry of
births and deaths from electoral procedures. While the tendency
everywhere else is to unify identity documents, the registration of
births and deaths with everything to do with election procedures.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;TcS :&nbsp; A very broad issue that generates controversy almost
every time
there is an election is precisely the independence of the Supreme
Electoral Council. Some people insist the magistrates, as a result of
their political affiliation, have to be biased in favour of one or
other of the political parties. La Prensa for example has argued this.
And I think Maximino Rodriguez one of the PLC leaders has also alleged
that the Consejo Supremo Electoral is now totally in the power of the
Frente Sandinista. What do you make of such accusations?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : I am very careful since our legal system does not contain very
clear elements relating to suits for libel or slander. It is not like
the United States or Europe where a libel suit or a suit for slander is
done differently than in our country. No. In our legal system despite
the law existing, its application is not done in the same way. I say
that up front because I am going to talk about specific individuals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I think that what is happening here firstly is that electoral bodies
are political bodies par excellence. There are very few countries in
Latin America where the electoral bodies are not made up of
representatives from political parties. And that is logical. I can't
see President Bush of the United States naming someone to a court that
will decide elections, naming a Democrat. I can't see it. So then, if
that's all right for them there, then why is it bad for us here? The
same happens in every other country.<br>
      <br>
There are countries too that are even more biased in a party political
sense, for example El Salvador. El Salvador says that the president of
the electoral body should be a member of the party that won the last
election. And the vice-president should be a member of the party that
came second in the last election. So that is a party political
representation that you have there.<br>
      <br>
Here in effect, of the seven of us who make up the tribunal, not
including our deputies, three people were proposed by the Frente
Sandinista, three people were proposed by the Partido Liberal
Constitucionalista and myself who was proposed by different parties,
including the self-same Maximino Rodriguez. And with every respect for
him, we will see if perhaps in the end Maximino Rodriguez is a
magistrate from 2010 onwards and if you interview him then maybe he
will have the same opinion that he is throwing out now. Some of the
people that you see&nbsp; every day on television in Nicaragua who are
supporters of the MRS, and I say this because they have openly
expressed it, if you were to name them magistrates on the Supreme
Electoral Council they will tell you they are not biased, that they are
impartial and they will cease the criticism that they are making today.<br>
      <br>
In good Nicaraguan, because it is not good Castilian Spanish, this is a
"Clear off you. Make room for me". That is how I understand the upshot
of this situation. If it's you, then you are biased. But if it's me,
then I am not biased, although still in representation of a given
political party. And so on. I sometimes say to myself that perhaps
after all if we put Dr. Tunnerman or Maximino Rodriguez then things
will get better and the Supreme Electoral Council will be impartial.<br>
      <br>
But, Nicaragua is a country where it is more than clearly demonstrated
that the popular will is respected. Our electoral system was worked out
by a group of nations during 1988 and 1989 so as to permit a large
number of observers and to ensure a virtual home vote. Here, in a poor
country, voters do not have to go more than five kilometres in rural
areas. We are not talking about England or Spain or Holland or the
United States. Here our rural areas are very different to the rural
areas of Europe.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So there is no more than five kilometres distance for voters to
travel and in the city it is no more than a kilometre. Voters almost
have people turning up to their door to say, "Here ma'am, here's the
voting box, please place your vote for the person you support." It is
almost a home vote, extremely costly, but that is the system. But it is
done like that too so as to make it highly participative. And here the
Council as a collegiate group does not decide who wins or who loses the
election. Here the Council simply transmits the results.<br>
      <br>
Every voting station, that elsewhere are called voting tables or
cantons, what it does is count the votes it received, sign a resolution
confirming the count and that for us is inviolable. Except in the case
of a challenge, which have been very few in the short history of our
democracy. A review is carried out at the different levels of the
electoral body and there are appeals that can be made for that review
and the truth is that never has there been much fuss except in the case
of Granada and a case brought up by the Partido Liberal
Constitucionalista in an Atlantic Coast municipality and for me neither
of the two have any merit.<br>
      <br>
The case on the Atlantic Coast is a very simple case where a regional
tribunal which is equivalent to the State there, because there is an
Autonomous Region, resolved that a challenge had no merit, would not be
addressed and hence there was no appeal to a higher body which in that
case was us. And if there is no appeal I cannot change the result, that
has not been altered by another body. Because that would indeed be
fraud and I see no point in that. And in the case in Granada there were
a series of irregularities in a voting station that in the end decided
who won the election and the irregularity is very serious, involving
people whom it is said were sent by the candidate who lost the
elections to try and promote disorder there.<br>
      <br>
So I think these criticisms are from individuals who are never going to
rest easy, beacuse when they see that they are going to lose an
election, and that has a lot to do with the question you put to me
about whether or not there was a deliberate failure to comply with all
the requirements asked of a given political party. I think that someone
who believes or has realised they are not going to get positive results
in an election can only try and call the election into question.
Rubbishing an election here is the same as being unpopular, of not
having sufficient grass roots' support to get a good result in the
election.<br>
      <br>
Every time I see a politician or member of the National Assembly
talking ill of the electoral authority, questioning why vote? when
everything is fixed, saying that here there will be fraud, the only
thing I am watching is someone whom I am certain is going to get a bad
result in the election and for that reason is trying to rubbish it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : One issue we come across constantly in our little online magazine
is what I call anti-reporting when national journalists and analysts
make false reports. We have found this in our reporting on Venezuelan
cooperation for example. I suppose the same thing happens on election
issues. For example Envío recently published an article in
which, among
many other things, it alleges that the FSLN manipulated events so as to
select you as the CSE President. I should imagine that is false.<br>
      <br>
RR : No, it is not true. Our electoral law has had many reforms but
from '93 or '94 the mechanism to elect the president was that
parliament decided once the magistrates were elected who would&nbsp; be
the
president of the Supreme Electoral Council. With the constitutional
reforms of 2000 it seemed to me extremely anti-democratic because if
you elect someone as president of the electoral tribunal and that
president is not up to it, as one might say, or does not perform well,
or is a poor administrator, a poor organizer of elections, you cannot
change them because you have to depose them, you have to pass through a
process to change them. I proposed that the president be elected by the
magistrates themselves for a period of one year to give the tribunal a
chance that, if it didn't work out for them, to say so and elect
someone else whom they think might do better.<br>
      <br>
So what the Frente Sandinista had was three votes and one needs five
votes to be able to be president of the Supreme Electoral Council.
There has to be a consensus of the Council's members for that to
happen. So no, the Frente was part of it because to a certain degree it
proposed magistrates, but once here as elected magistrates they are
Nicaraguan citizens vested with electoral authority and among
themselves they sought consensus and elected their president because
they preferred an individual like myself who did not come from a
particular political party or ideological current.<br>
      <br>
That gives rise to huge criticism. They tell you that such a one was
with Alemán or that this one was with Ortega. To cap it all they
say
President Ortega is threatening me... they say any number of things.
But these magazines like Envío are aimed more to the
international
level where one has no chance to reply. So then you say the president
of the Council is a thief, is corrupt, the president of the Council is
not transparent, the Council president has no defence nationally
because the communications media do not allow it and there is little
contact internatinally like this interview with you now. But there is
not the least evidence and I can do absolutely nothing because the day
I present a lawsuit in a court somewhere to denounce a calumny, that
day then I will be threatening freedom of expression and so already
they have alleged that here is a totalitarian country and that a
left-wing dictatorship has taken over the country.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : So the allegation that the FSLN chose you is false.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
RR : Totally false..<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : Another thing that comes out in this article is that they
say&nbsp;
that some years ago the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that
the electoral law here in Nicaragua has to be changed. What can you
tell us about that?<br>
      <br>
RR : There is a ruling that it seems to me over-reached its
jurisdiction, because there has to be respect in the sense that one
does not go to any of the countries that make up that Inter-American
body to say they should change their laws because one does not like
them. The Dominican republic system some years ago had men and women
vote in separate voting stations. Women and men vote separately in
Chile. They have different registers. I am not intruding into Chilean
or Dominican affairs. Every country has its own ways of doing things.
That wasn't really the issue.<br>
      <br>
The issue was that the Yatama party did not present the candidates it
had to present. That came to the electoral Council in the year 2000 and
it resolved that Yatama was not to participate in that election. So
Yatama resorted to the Inter-American Court and the Inter-American
Court&nbsp; ruled that Yatama had been wronged and the Nicaraguan State
had
to indemnify it with a million dollars and in the ruling it said
something about reforming the electoral law. But in that it
over-reached its jurisdiction. Here one complies with the bodies to
which Nicaragua is a signatory within respect for its sovereignty and
for non-interference in its internal affairs.<br>
      <br>
If this is a mechanism for Yatama to defend itself and the Court ruled
that, great, here we comply. But neither should the Court over-reach
its jurisdiction and say not only that Nicaraguan reform its electoral
law but also, for example, that President Ortega finishes his period
tomorrow and is not to wait until January 10th, 2012. There are things
to comply with, but there are things that one cannot comply with
because they damage national sovereignty.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS : You and your colleagues are certainly more than well aware that
the country's electoral law has come through recent periods with many
changes. Do you think&nbsp; those changes will stand or will it be
necessary
to make further changes to the country's electoral law?<br>
      <br>
RR : I think from my own technical point of view that the electoral lw
has to be reformed. I'd go further and say that we do not have a law of
political parties. The Council supervises compliance with the one law
of the political parties that states that the parties must comply with
their statutes. I would say that Nicaragua ought to have an Electoral
Code covering Political Parties, a Registry of Births and Deaths,
citizen's identity and which also covers the administrative part of the
electoral law. An Electoral Code should exist. I think there are people
who call daily in the media for possible electoral reforms. Of course
the reforms they suggest are again just trying to get an advantage
through those reforms.<br>
      <br>
But they are not looking at reform from our point of view who know the
system's weaknesses from an organizational point of view. What we want
is for that to be reformed and I will explain why. For example, the law
has a chapter on the communications media. The original law was made in
1983 when communciations media were all in the hands of the State.
Today they are all in private hands. The State only has a radio station
which has been got to work with hardly any funding and a TV channel
that is closed. So how are we going to give the political parties media
space in something that is closed and non-existent? And then it says
that the Supreme Electoral Council should control the media in their
own spaces.<br>
      <br>
Do you think at this point in the game we are going to try and control
the communications media in their own spaces? We can invite them to
obey the law. But if they fail to comply, we are not going to walk into
the trap of trying to limit them or close them down or fine them,
because we would be attacking freedom of expression. So that is an area
where some balance has to exist.<br>
      <br>
There are other elements, for example the law contemplated this article
that here you are permitted to vote, contrary to what is the case in
many countries in the world, where you&nbsp; do not appear in the roll
of
voters. It is logical that this offers an opportunity for fraud. It is
included because the identity documents have not finished being
processed so everyone in Nicragua has their identity document to hand.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Today now I think that should not exist. The law includes an ad hoc
inscription process which was what was used in our countries many years
ago when there were no permanent electoral rolls. One turned up four
Sundays prior to the elections to register in a catalogue of voters,
you were given a document with which to exercise your vote three or
four weekends later. And that was eliminated. It had no reason to
continue. There is a series of measures giving more flexibility to
certain elements of the electoral tribunal so that it may decide on the
issue of what is economically appropriate in budgetary terms for a very
poor country. For example they put a ceiling of 400 voters to every
voting station. But we have a problem. If there is one voter extra we
have to open another voting station and that means a lot of money for
the Council and the need to change boundaries or limits for that
electoral canton or unit just for that one extra person.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So we are trying to work out some mechanism for reform to make a
serious proposal for an electoral reform not designed to benefit the
Frente Sandinista or the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista or the MRS
or the Partido Conservador but rather a proposal that benefits and
facilitates the democratic exercise in Nicaragua guaranteeing people
that their popular will is going to be permanently respected. Reforms
were made to the law here in 1996 at least five times in the same year.
The culmination was a reform in the assignment of seats twenty days
after the elections took place, a reform that took place in the
Council. I was a member of the tribunal then. I did not sign that
reform because I was not invited to the meeting. But nobody mentions
that now. But as a result of that reform the marital partner of the
then president of the Supreme Electoral Council was elected as a deputy.<br>
      <br>
Here everything depends on the angle from which you view things and
there is plenty of ill-intentioned work devoted to trying to detroy the
image, not just of the Frente Sandinista but also of the Partido
Liberal which is a very strong party and which I consider an extremely
valid component of democracy in Nicaragua so there exists a balance and
a counter-balance. I always think that in our countries we should have
logical balances because if we do not have those balances, things will
go badly for us. That leads to other types of systems that are not
appropriate for our countries that have suffered some very hard things
in years gone by. <br>
