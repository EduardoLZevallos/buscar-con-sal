<h3><strong>Part I</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Introduction by Michael Swifte, WKOG collective:</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“<em>The ruling class, with full knowledge of the technocratic plans being implemented, have fashioned a false narrative of our unpleasant choices in living with ever expanding digital ‘social’ networks and the force that is exercised by those who control the ‘social’. Klaus Schwab sits at the refashioned locus of globalist power, the helm at which the captains of stakeholder capitalism command and refashion the consumer economy, accelerated under lockdowns, amplified by the control and manipulation of data and the production of fear. Here Cory Morningstar in her usual richly detailed fashion illustrates the extensive networks and interrogates the heavily constructed statements that signify the growing political will for the management of global populations under the banner of the ‘great reset’ and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Imagine the feeling of the strands of a fishing net being pulled ever more tightly against your skin. Now imagine that there is only one way for you and the shoal of which you are a part to escape. Morningstar shows that technology will not deliver efficiencies or reduce consumption, but rather, like highways that continue to widen, they will only bring further destruction and demand on resources.”</em></strong></p>

<p><span class="dropcap2">R</span>eleased by Netflix on September 9, 2020, the documentary “The Social Dilemma” was, in extremely <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-movies-on-netflix-this-week-due-date-social-dilemma-2020-9">short order</a>, trending on the streaming platform. The Social Dilemma became a social contagion, highlighted by media outlets across the spectrum, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbbrandon/2020/09/17/why-the-social-dilemma-on-netflix-is-such-an-important-film/#454468da4e68">Forbes</a>. On <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/social-dilemma-netflix-film-media-facebook-twitter-algorithm-addiction-conspiracy-b454736.html">September 18, 2020</a>, The Independent praised the film as “the most important documentary of our times”. On <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/netflix-releases-viewership-numbers-for-enola-holmes-project-power-social-dilemma-but-nothing-can-beat-extraction/story-y3DjJWQOf9oDOy43gySyRK.html#:~:text=The%20Social%20Dilemma%20scored%2038%20million%20views.&amp;text=The%20streamer%20also%20shared%20numbers%20for%20certain%20shows.">October 21, 2020</a>, it was reported that 38 million Netflix subscribers had viewed the film.</p>

<p>Other words for dilemma include “predicament”, “quandary”, “plight”, “bind” and “embarrassment”.</p>

<p>The film is described by Netflix as a “documentary<em>–</em>drama hybrid explor[ing] the dangerous human impact of social networking, with tech experts sounding the alarm on their own creations.” Yet, in today’s world of foundation-funded film and media, what is not disclosed, is more often than not, far more important than what is. Such is the case with The Social Dilemma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A compilation of interviews, interspersed with a fictional film, this documentary is not as effective as it wanted to be, and definitely not as informative as it should be.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>— <a href="https://www.filmcompanion.in/streaming/the-social-dilemma-netflix-review-doesnt-say-more-than-you-already-probably-know-on-addiction-social-media-and-civil-war-documentary/">Sept 9, 2020</a>, The Social Dilemma On Netflix Review: Doesn’t Say More Than You Already, Probably, Know On Addiction, Social Media, And Civil War</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With capitalism destroying the planet, the false premise of “stakeholder capitalism” has been rolled out via media channels in order to permeate the public psyche. This can be more aptly described as a rebranding, marketing strategy. The goal being for the corporatocracy, insulated by the ruling class, to retain the social licence required, to continue their plunder of the planet. With the Fourth Industrial Revolution unleashed against a “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/embrace-the-tech-backlash/">growing public backlash against technology</a>“, recognized as both a threat and hurdle by the World Economic Forum (January 16, 2018), one must contemplate if The Social Dilemma is to inhumane technology what “stakeholder capitalism” is to inhumane capitalism. An assurance of protection against harm that cannot be negotiated – in order to mitigate concern and quell dissent. In order to build and maintain the acquiescence of the global citizenry. And the answer to such contemplation, is – yes.</p>

<p>“Never before has a small sector had so much power over the entire World, to monitor the present and predict future behaviours of not just individuals, but entire populations. The problem is more alarming when we consider how the public and private sectors are merging in joint ventures in a quest for global domination, penetrating every government, every citizen movement, mediating every action in every connected person’s life through digital devices and data collection.”</p>

<p>Consider the documentary’s protagonist and driving force <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/who-we-are">Tristan Harris</a>, who made Fortune’s 40 Under 40 list in 2018. In November 2011, Google acquired the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-buys-startup-apture-to-boost-chrome-2011-11">Apture</a> start-up founded by Harris for an undisclosed amount thought to be between 10-20 million USD. At this same time, Harris took the position of project manager at Google. In April 2013, Google would assign Harris the new title of “Design Ethicist &amp; Product Philosopher.” In 2013, while working for Google (Harris would work for Google from November 2011 to January 2016), Harris and <a href="http://aza.wtf/">Aza Raskin</a> (interface designer and entrepreneur, Forbes 30 Under 30, 2012), co-founded “Time Well Spent”, a term coined by Harris with social scientist <a href="https://nxhx.org/">Joe Edelman</a>. <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/james-williams/">James Williams</a> and filmmaker <a href="http://www.maxstossel.com/">Max Stossel</a> (named by Forbes as one of the best storytellers of the year, 2016), are also co-founders of Time Well Spent. Stossel’s clients include <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/our-cases/corrie-et-al-v-caterpillar">Caterpillar</a>, a gross violator of human rights, for its <a href="https://www.wordsthatmove.com/blog/caterpillar">#TogetherStronger</a> campaign, and National Geographic (a leading entity in the charge to monetize the planet’s “ecosystem services”). Prior to co-founding the Time Well Spent campaign, Williams worked at Google for over a decade, receiving the <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/2004/">Founder’s Award</a>, the corporation’s highest honour, for his work on search advertising and tools. [5] Following the founding of Time Well Spent, on December 1, 2014 Harris would deliver a talk at TED Brussels.</p>

<p>The simultaneous TED and WIRED media coverage would amplify the increasing exposure, catapulting Harris – along with the “Time Well Spent movement” into the spotlight. Approximately six months later, on February 4, 2018, Time Well Spent was renamed the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a> (CHT). (The Time Well Spent <a href="https://twitter.com/TimeWellSpentio">Twitter account</a> has remained inactive since February 12, 2018.)</p>

On May 15, 2019, Harris would attend the second Tech for Good summit. Following the <a href="https://linagora.com/open-source-news/tech-for-good-summit">very white ensemble</a> of industry leaders and heads of states, just days later, on May 18, 2019, the Yellow Vests anti-government protests across France would commence for the 27th week in a row. Fully demonstrating his aspirations for the good and well-being of citizens, Macron’s riot police would use tear gas and violence to disperse the crowds. [“According to the French Mediapart website, 11 people were killed, five lost their hands due to use of grenades and 23 lost their eyesight. Some 2,000 people were injured at the demonstrations. Of them 268 people suffered head injuries, 15 hand injuries, 64 body injuries, 26 back injuries and 106 leg injuries.”][<a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/casualties-from-yellow-vest-protests-rise/1469388">Source</a>]</p>

<p>“New technology is always disruptive. It kills jobs, creates new ones, and ushers in profound social change. But the breakneck speed and sheer scale of this round of technical change is something else – it threatens the very definition of what it is to be human. We’re being presented with a huge range of ethical dilemmas. How do we get together to agree the rules on things like genetically modified babies, the robots of war, and the algorithms that determine our life chances?”</p>

<p>The Digital Africa initiative was launched by Macron in 2018. [<a href="https://www.elysee.fr/admin/upload/default/0001/08/23c18d41821bd9bb2505555892fcbc19d52a3b5d.pdf">Source</a>] In September 2020, the European Union pressed to push back the elections in socialist Venezuela. This is what colonialism and imperialism look like. Imagine the reaction to a Digital France Initiative – launched by the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani. Imagine the reaction if Venezuela were to demand the European Union push back elections, to meet conditions for the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) which would send an observer mission. Yet, the racism that undermines the foundations of a Western society built on white supremacy does not allow for such thoughts.</p>

<p>Here we can add that The Social Dilemma filmmakers have formed a partnership with imperialist NGO Amnesty International. Amnesty International serves as partner to the World Economic Forum “Civil Society in the Fourth Industrial Revolution Initiative.” [1] In 2011, Amnesty played a leading role in the annihilation of Libya. Avaaz, another instrument of empire, belonging to the non-profit industrial complex, would also play a leading role. Avaaz and *Purpose, serving many of the most powerful corporations and institutions on the planet, create emotive campaigns for climate change, while serving as instruments for war and occupation on targeted sovereign states. The irony that the military is a key driver of both climate change and ecological devastation is seemingly lost on the collective Western citizenry. [*Purpose is the public relations arm of Avaaz, specializing in “public mobilization and storytelling… that can shift policies and change public narratives.”]</p>

<p>With markets in the Global North relatively saturated (with citizenry and state both inundated with debt), the world’s most powerful institutions, amidst a global consolidation of power are seeking to recolonize the Global South. “Tech for Good” is the exponential “<a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/future-workforce/artificial-intelligence-blockchain-techforgood">scaling up of social transformation in the fourth industrial revolution</a>“, transforming Africa into data colonies that serve the West. Transforming children, people, and all life into data commodities – a new asset class. This is a global behavioural change project, unprecedented in scale, with civil society groups and groomed influencers, having been <a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/preparing-civil-society-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution">tasked</a> with replacing societal backlash with social licence.</p>

<p>Time Well Spent/Center for Humane Technology identifies its purpose as “a movement to align technology with our humanity”. Yet, its answer to the inhumanity of tech is to be found in <a href="https://digitalmindfulness.net/portfolio/time-well-spent/">market solutions</a>, within the capitalist framework, which can neither be tamed, nor negotiated. For it itself, is inhumane.</p>

Founded by Arianna Huffington and launched on <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/arianna-huffington-welcome-to-thrive-global-bbdaea4aa455">November 30, 2016</a>, Thrive Global is a behavioural change media and technology venture headquartered in New York with offices in San Francisco, Mumbai, Athens and Melbourne. Thrive Global partnerships include Accenture, JPMorgan Chase and Uber. Huffington serves on many <a href="https://www.wealthx.com/intelligence-centre/daily-news/2016/arianna-huffington-joins-global-citizen-board/">boards</a> including Uber, <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/partners/">Global Citizen</a>, and Onex, a private equity firm managing <a href="https://www.onex.com/home">USD 36 billion</a> in assets. Thrive Global investors include founder and CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, World Economic Forum Board of Trustees, inaugural Chair of World Economic Forum’s Forum Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco, Jack Ma, founder and Executive Chairman of Alibaba Group,  member of the Board of Trustees, World Economic Forum, World Economic Forum Global Shapers board of directors, Breakthrough Energy Coalition co-founder (with Bill Gates), and the <a href="https://www.ivp.com/about/">venture firm IVP</a> (“We don’t just know growth; we drive hypergrowth.”) Thrive Global would target an elite bourgeoisie demographic serving as a promotional-marketing platform for venture philanthropy and social impact investing.</p>

<p>“I visited Thrive Global’s pop-up on Broome today. Just beautiful… People are searching for more balance—myself included. That nap room was TO DIE FOR. Shaggy, snuggly, sensational to the senses… I sat on the lower level with a dear friend, in the gray egg chairs for nearly an hour—sipped tea and connected. We so enjoyed it amidst the pressure of Christmas shopping and end of year work demands. I loved hearing your soothing voice and lovely accent coming from the speaker: ‘good night Instagram.'”</p>

<p>Par for the course, Indigenous peoples are exploited for the marketing component of Thrive, while in real life Thrive protects and expands the very system responsible for Indigenous genocide that continues to this day. In addition, with Black Lives Matter serving as the new corporate anthem to assist in marketing an illusory “stakeholder capitalism”, images of Black Lives Matter protests also feature on the homepage.</p>

<h3>All Roads Lead to Further Plunder – the Fourth Industrial Revolution “Great Reset”</h3>

<p>It is critical at this juncture, to expand upon the pivotal role of Thrive Global investor Marc Benioff, founder and CEO of Salesforce, which is a partner of Thrive Global. Benioff, a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees, serves as inaugural Chair of World Economic Forum’s Forum Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco – home of the “great reset”. In addition to these roles, Benioff is a co-founder of Breakthrough Energy Coalition (nuclear, carbon capture and storage, biofuel, etc.), with billionaires including Bill Gates, Jack Ma, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Chris Hohn. [<a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2015/12/07/the-big-three-the-21st-century-clean-energy-regime/">Full list</a>] <span class="aCOpRe">The coalition, led by Gates, is a <a href="http://mission-innovation.net/our-work/private-sector-engagement/">private partnership</a> created in tandem with the public-facing <a href="http://mission-innovation.net/about-mi/our-collaborators/">Mission Innovation</a>, which is partnered with 24 states and the <a href="http://www.theartofannihilation.com/an-object-lesson-in-spectacle-excerpt-from-the-manufacturing-of-greta-thunberg-for-consent-volume-ii/">European Union</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country… We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of… In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons…who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.</p>

<p>“You might expect that Facebook, which derives its profits from the amount of time people spend interacting with the advertisements in its apps, would reject the Time Well Spent thesis. Instead, the company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571">co-opted it</a>. In a January 11th post, Mark Zuckerberg invoked the initiative by name. “By focusing on bringing people closer together — whether it’s with family and friends, or around important moments in the world — we can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent,” he wrote.</p>

<p>The Center for Humane Technology hosts the podcast “Your Undivided Attention”. The <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/18-the-stubborn-optimists-guide-to-saving-the-planet">May 18, 2020 podcast</a> “The Stubborn Optimist’s Guide to Saving the Planet” features the prominent Christiana Figueres, who explains “a clear and alluring vision of a future that can supplant the dystopian” is required for the “great reset” Fourth Industrial Revolution architecture, as <a href="https://youtu.be/41l1GAm7f4M">sought by the World Economic Forum</a>, to take hold. The “future we choose”, (The Future We Choose by Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, February 25, 2020) is, in fact, the future they chose some time ago. The podcast attributes Figueres with “stubborn optimism” for having convinced state governments to sign the Paris Agreement.

<p>In the same way that <a href="http://www.theartofannihilation.com/a-100-trillion-dollar-storytelling-campaign-a-short-story/">Greta Thunberg</a> never touches upon the sought financialization of nature, global in scale (expected to be implemented in 2021), instead serving as the very face of the campaign; in the same way that Thunberg does not shine an imperative light on militarization as a key driver of climate change, the Center for Humane Technology, which highlights climate change as a key concern, makes no mention of the massive and growing carbon footprint by the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector [A look at this growth is extensively detailed further in this report]. In the same way that Thunberg remains silent on the roll-out of 5G (the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks), adding additional layers of threats to biodiversity and all living life forms, including human, neither does the Centre for Humane Technology. 5G is, unequivocally, the very foundation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, launched to the public as “the great reset”. Without 5G, the Fourth Industrial Revolution architecture, as sought by the ruling class, will collapse like a house of cards. These deliberate omissions represent the most egregious form of climate denialism that goes largely unchallenged. To call for humane technology while making no mention of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is an impossible oversight. We are being conditioned to accept, and even demand, the very infrastructure and said “solutions” that the states, serving the ruling classes, wish to impose on us. This is <a href="http://www.theartofannihilation.com/the-manufacturing-of-greta-thunberg-for-consent-the-behavioural-change-project-to-change-everything-volume-ii-act-v/">social engineering en masse</a>.</p>

<h3>Social Media – We Think the Price Is Worth It</h3>

<p>The Social Dilemma film highlights the arrival and exponential growth of social media, and its direct correlation with self-harm and suicide amongst pre-teens and youth: U.S. hospital admissions of girls aged 15-19 have increased 62% since 2009 (correlating with social media becoming accessible via the mobile phone), with the admission of young girls aged 10-14 having increased a staggering 189%. U.S. suicide rates for young girls are just as alarming with a 70% increase for girls aged 15-19 (*compared to the average from 2001-2010), with the suicide rate of the younger group of girls (aged 10-14) increasing a whopping *151%. This tragedy alone should be enough to relegate social media to the dustbin, yet in an “Albright-esque” depravity, society has accepted the self-harm and suicides with the unspoken yet collective “we think the price is worth it” non-response. The corporate world that lies and breathes this depraved ideology never has espoused nor never will espouse a higher regard for humanity than for profits.</p>

<p>And while the documentary appears to highlight social media’s atrocious negative impacts on the social fabric of whole societies, and in spite of highlighting the incredible harm on youth, the film does not once mention Facebook’s latest colonial conquest: the continent of culturally rich and diverse Africa – with a median age of eighteen years old.</p>

<p>Nor does the film, or Harris, mention the Facebook project “internet.org”. Not dead, but rebranded as “Free Basics”,<br />
rolling out quietly behind a purposeful media blackout.</p>

<p>The goal of Facebook is world domination. On February 4, 2016, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the corporation’s goal of obtaining <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10918680/5-billion-facebook-users-by-2030-mark-zuckerberg">5 billion users by 2030</a>. Two days later, following nationwide protests in India, the Facebook project, having been rebranded to “Free Basics”, was <a href="https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Regulation_Data_Service.pdf">banned</a> by the Telecom regulatory Authority of India.</p>

<p>Facebook realised it would need to attain, what the World Economic Forum today must also acquire for “the great reset”. That is, social license. With unlimited resources, the World Economic Forum has retained and financed civil society (non-profits, NGOs). Influencers have been chosen and moulded. The <a href="https://www.globalshapers.org/">Global Shapers</a> have been mobilised. In <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/uUlZQzdzMKsjo/">January 2020</a>, “<a href="https://www.schwabfound.org/">The Schwab Foundation</a> community joined world leaders at a time where the issues at the core of the community’s work is now front and centre of the global agenda.” Nightmares for citizens and biodiversity are being wrapped in dark green vellum and holistic linguistics. “Humane” is to tech, what “stakeholder” is to capitalism. A rebranding exercise selling a kinder, new gentler form of oppression, exploitation and misery. A kinder, soft power form of psychological manipulation, purposeful addiction, and democratic depression.</p>

<p>As a nod to its funders and neoliberalism itself, the film warns of the threat to be “radicalized” by “anti-vaxxers”, and those that don’t vote. That is, those that are not interested in a “vaccine revolution” being sought to further serve the interests (profits) of the pharmaceutical industry, rather than the interests of society’s health and well-being. That is, those who understand that elections held in states that serve the global corporatocracy represent nothing more than “another exciting round of elections in the fabulous wonderland of bourgeois democracy.” (Stephanie McMillan). All while the real threat is the continued pacification, conditioning and domestication of the citizenry.</p>

<p>The devolving of physical relationships and whole societies, up against an accelerating, digitalized, virtual world is not a social dilemma. The leveraging of COVID-19, waged as a weapon against the citizenry, is not a social dilemma. Rather, this is the strategic destruction of the social. A social dismantling. A social deliquesce. A social nightmare.</p>

<div>
<div dir="auto">
<p>For the Fourth Industrial Revolution to take hold, our global society must be socially engineered to accept, even prefer an artificial existence over that of a physical one. The saturation of the collective psyche with language and framing such as “tech for good” is strategic, a key method and means of obtaining the social license required for the <a href="https://youtu.be/7lva8VsYc7o">Fourth Industrial Revolution “great reset”</a>. The “watch dogs” put forward as reassurance to assuage a growing anxiety, thus a growing threat of backlash, serve not society, but the hand that feeds.</p>

<p>Physical is dangerous, digital is safe. Humans are lethal, technology is benign. Masks assist in dehumanising the human body. The conditioning for avoidance of human intimacy. Children learning not to touch. Nature is both separate and zoonotic – stay home, stay safe. Our deteriorating social fabric, already eroded from social media, and technology at large, has been doused with gasoline. It burns in silence behind a veil of willful blindness. Both isolated and detached from the physical presence of one another, and nature herself, we are in freefall. Remains of relationships in piles of invisible ashes.</p>

<h3>Next: Part II</h3>
