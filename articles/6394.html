<p><strong>MESSAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA AT THE SUMMIT OF HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMUNITY OF LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN STATES – CELAC.</strong></p>

<p><strong>April 9th, 2025<br />
Tegucigalpa, Honduras</strong></p>

<p>Sister President<br />
Xiomara Castro Sarmiento<br />
President of the Republic of Honduras<br />
President Pro-Tempore of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States - CELAC</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers<br />
Heads of State and Government,<br />
Ministers of Foreign Affairs,<br />
Heads of Delegation of the Member Countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States - CELAC</p>

<p>Compañeros and Compañeras of the Delegations, Guests.</p>

<p>Allow me to convey the Fraternal Greetings and Affection of Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Compañera Rosario Murillo Zambrana, Co-Presidents of the Republic of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>We express our deep and special gratitude to the Sister Republic of Honduras, to Comrade President Xiomara Castro and her team, for their successful work at the helm of CELAC this year, as well as for the extraordinary organization of the tasks within the framework of this Summit of Heads of State and Government of the CELAC Countries.</p>

<p>This important mechanism bringing together the countries of our Latin America and Caribbean America is the result of many years of tenacious work in the search for regional unity, of the urgent dream of Latin American and Caribbean Unity.</p>

<p><br />
To this land of Francisco Morazán, forger of Central American Unity, we arrived committed to continue building the Unity of the Great Latin American and Caribbean Nation, following the inspiration of our own General of Free Men and Women Augusto C. Sandino, who called on us to build this Supreme Dream of Bolivar.</p>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of the Republic of Nicaragua will continue to participate actively in these spaces, promoting the unity of our peoples and Governments engaged in the fundamental task of fighting poverty to achieve well-being for our Peoples, accompanied by the inescapable commitment to live in Peace, to promote Solidarity and Understanding between our Peoples and Governments.</p>

<p><br />
This Summit of Heads of State and Government of CELAC is the right place to reiterate that the Soul, the Spirit and the Tenderness of solidarity among Peoples is fundamental to face daily the complexities, challenges, difficulties and injustices of this world, always changing, always in transformation.</p>

<p>We came to this Summit remembering that CELAC has some basic principles, built up over the years. Principles on which the region has been reaching agreements and which our country wishes to reiterate in this forum.</p>

<p>We continue to express our firm defense of the independence and self-determination of our peoples and of non-interference in our internal affairs, where mutual respect is the indispensable basis for achieving the harmony and peace to which our Peoples have the right.</p>

<p>We continue to defend the sovereign equality of States, of their territorial integrity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of each country.</p>

<p>We reaffirm our commitment to the defense of sovereignty and the right of every State to define its institutional and normative framework, free from threats, aggression and unilateral coercive measures.</p>

<p>We express our unchanging and growing solidarity with the Brotherly Bolivarian People and Government of Venezuela in its struggle for the Dignity and Defense of its People against external aggressions, suffering the impacts of cruel, constant, inhuman aggressions, including unilateral coercive measures, which recently have been more frequent and evident, against that valiant People.</p>

<p>We reiterate once again our unwavering commitment to the Sister Republic of Cuba, in its tenacious fight against the inhuman economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States since 1962, as well as our rejection of unilateral lists and certifications or their inclusion in lists of alleged sponsors of terrorism. This has been one of the broadest agreements reached in the various international organizations and part of the consensus that our region cannot allow itself to be attacked.</p>

<p>We will continue to denounce all forms of aggression and unilateral coercive measures against the dreams of Peace and Well-being of our Peoples and Governments, especially in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.</p>

<p>We recognize the legitimate demand of the fraternal Caribbean peoples for reparations for the crimes of colonialism and slavery and we reject any extortion against them, for their efforts to achieve better living conditions and health for their peoples.</p>

<p>We express our ever-present solidarity to the brotherly people of Haiti, who have the inalienable right to build Peace and Well-being without external interventions.</p>

<p>We express our unwavering solidarity with the People of Palestine and will continue to denounce the horrendous crimes and genocide that the Zionist State of Israel continues to carry out against the suffering People of Palestine, who have the right to enjoy their own Free, Sovereign and Independent State.</p>

<p>We call on our CELAC, to convene an Urgent and Permanent Session so as to analyze the very serious consequences of the Tariff Policies decreed by the United States of America against the World, and to agree on common actions and measures to address their consequences, prioritizing the Rights of our Peoples, and in particular the Struggles against Poverty, and for a Dignified Existence of Well-being.</p>

<p>We came to this Summit following our tradition of calling for Unity, Solidarity and Peace, as a condition for achieving the Well-being to which our peoples have the right.</p>

<p>Well-being seen as the security of individuals, families, communities. Food security, in line with the eradication of hunger, poverty and inequalities.</p>

<p>Security of fair access to health, education, and employment. Responsibility for the protection of Mother Earth and preparation for Nature’s onslaughts, especially on the islands and coastal areas of our Latin American Caribbean or in areas where conditions make it difficult to sustain life.</p>

<p>It is precisely these difficulties, created by the unjust world order and greed, that have forced thousands of brothers and sisters to migrate from their communities, in search of better conditions to sustain the life of their families.</p>

<p>We express our permanent solidarity with the sisters and brothers who have had to migrate from their countries and we demand dignified treatment for those who are made to return to their countries.</p>

<p>We agree with the legitimate demand of the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela for the safe return of Venezuelan migrant brothers. We express our solidarity with those who have been kidnapped and imprisoned, denied all their rights and we demand their immediate return to their Nation.</p>

<p>We enthusiastically welcome the upcoming Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, we are sure that this mechanism and platform for dialogue and its initiatives will be a good opportunity to exchange and open new bridges of cooperation.</p>

<p>Compañeros and Compañeras,</p>

<p>We have the responsibility to tell the world that these are the issues that were discussed by CELAC and that they have broad agreement in our region. These positions of principle and dignity are inalienable for Nicaragua and should be reflected in any Declaration by this Summit.</p>

<p>Brothers and Sisters.</p>

<p>We continue to dream of a United, Solidarity inspired and Cooperative Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), sheltered under the Principle of being a Zone of Peace, Development and Well-being.</p>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of the Republic of Nicaragua reiterates its firm will to continue building this Great Homeland, to continue strengthening the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in the search for Harmony, Peace, Well-being and Understanding between our peoples.</p>

<p>Sister President<br />
Fellow Chancellor</p>

<p>The attitude of a few countries that act with the purpose of reducing and diluting the principles, heritage and rich history of our Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) has been notorious and constant.</p>

<p>The vetoes have been verified and we have identified those who have drawn red lines to our Integration efforts.</p>

<p>Nicaragua rejects any attempt to undermine not only the founding ideals of our Community, but also attempts to exclude and neglect the serious problems that afflict our Region’s Peoples.</p>

<p>We make it clear that a declaration that does not include the rich history of our Community of Latin American and Caribbean States responds to attempts to weaken the efforts of those of us who want a strong CELAC and has the objective of dividing us and reducing our principles to an nacceptable minimum.</p>

<p>Nicaragua expressed at the time and without hesitation that it fully supported the proposal that the Pro-Tempore Presidency presented as a Draft Declaration a month ago.</p>

<p>But the actions of those who sabotaged this effort were obvious and visible, to the point of proposing a minimal, diluted document that does not express the great issues and problems facing our peoples in the Region and in the World.</p>

<p>We are not here to accept a document merely for the sake of doing so.  </p>

<p>A CELAC declaration under minimum conditions must continue to defend the sovereign equality of States, the right to Self-determination, Territorial Integrity and Non-intervention in the internal affairs of each country.</p>

<p>It must reaffirm our commitment to the defense of Sovereignty and the right of every State to define its institutional and normative framework, free from threats, aggression and unilateral coercive measures.</p>

<p>It must continue to express our firm rejection of the aggressions and the blockade imposed by the United States since 1962 against the Sister Republic of Cuba.</p>

<p>It cannot fail to express solidarity with the Fraternal Bolivarian People and Government of Venezuela in their struggle for the Dignity and Defense of their People against external aggressions.</p>

<p>It cannot but denounce all forms of aggression and unilateral coercive measures against our Peoples and Governments.</p>

<p>It must express the unwavering solidarity of this region with the People of Palestine and denounce the horrendous crimes against them.</p>

<p>A declaration of this Summit should refer to the very serious consequences of the Tariff Policies decreed by the United States of America against the World, and agree on common actions and measures to address their consequences.</p>

<p>A declaration by CELAC should include solidarity with the Sisters and Brothers who have had to migrate from their native countries and should demand dignified treatment for those who are made to return to their countries.</p>

<p>It must recognize the legitimate demand of the fraternal Caribbean Peoples for reparations for the crimes of colonialism and slavery, reject any extortion against them and express unequivocal solidarity towards the Fraternal People of Haiti without external interventions.</p>

<p>Many of these elements have been extensively addressed by most delegations, but they have not been reflected in the proposed Declaration.</p>

<p>We believe that any report should reflect the rich discussions held and should reflect more clearly and truthfully the reality of the intense and profound discussions that the Heads of State and Government have held at this important Summit.</p>

<p>The Republic of Nicaragua reiterates that it will continue to participate, work and promote the unity and integration of the Region, while reiterating that it cannot accept or accompany the document presented as a proposal for a Declaration, because it does not reflect the complex realities that the peoples of the world and the region are living through and because it departs from the fundamental principles that underlie this organization.</p>

<p>Thank you Very Much.</p>
