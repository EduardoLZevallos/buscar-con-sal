Alexis Argüello, the legendary Nicaraguan boxing world champion who has
served as Mayor of Managua since his electoral triumph in November
2008, tragically died this morning. The cause of death has not yet been
confirmed, but by all accounts Argüello, who has struggled with
depression most of his life, committed suicide. In honour of one of
Nicaragua's most loved personalities, Tortilla con Sal has put together
this short obituary.<br>
<br>
Born on Abril 19th 1952 into an impoverished working class family,
Argüello's childhood was not&nbsp;easy. His parents Guillermo
Argüello and Zoila Bohórquez struggled to provide enough
food&nbsp;for their eight children. Alexis and his brothers and
sisters, like the majority of Nicaraguan children of his generation was
"descalzo" (barefoot) most of the time. This was the case despite the
fact that
Guillermo their father was a shoemaker. <br>
<br>
Argüello demonstrated a sense of duty to his family from a young age
taking the decision, at age nine and against his parents' will, to
leave the family home in the Monseñor Lezcano neighbourhood of Managua
to look for work in the countryside in order to ease the family's
financial situation. Four years later, at the age of thirteen, Argüello
travelled to Canada to work for a year. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Argüello's dazzling
boxing career</span><br>
<br>
On return to his native Nicaragua Argüello discovered boxing, the
sport that was to lead him to international fame. Unable to attend
secondary school due to financial hardship,
Argüello threw himself into boxing starting his
professional career&nbsp;in 1968 at the age of
sixteen. <br>
<br>
Ironically Argüello's first international match resulted in a
humiliating defeat - a knockout in the first round. Unshaken and all
the more determined to prove himself, Alexis went on have one of the
most successful careers in boxing history,
with 82 wins and only 8 defeats. <br>
<br>
Nicknamed "El Flaco Explosivo" (the Explosive Thin Man), Argüello was
considered a great tactical boxer with a surprisingly powerful punch.
Another nickname used by commentators and boxing fanatics was "the
Gentleman of the Ring" due to his gracious manner and his tendency to
hug
his opponents and help them up after having knocked them out.<br>
<br>
Argüello goes down in&nbsp;history as one of only eight men to have
won boxing world championships in three different weight categories. In
1974 Alexis beat Ruben Olivares in the final of the
featherweight championship of the World Boxing Association. He defended
the title several times before moving into the junior light weight
category. <br>
<br>
In
1978 he won against junior light weight world champion Alfredo Escalero
in Bayamón Puerto Rico in the final of the World Boxing Council
championship in a match refered to within the boxing world as "the
bloody battle of Bayamón" and considered one of the most brutal fights
in boxing history.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Again Argüello defended the junior
light weight champion on numerous occasions before going to win his
third world championship title, this time in the light weight category,
against Scottish boxer Jim Watt in London in 1981.<br>
<br>
Argüello's
first retired from professional boxing&nbsp;in 1983 aged 31.
Between
1985 and 1995, unable to find stability in his life after giving up
boxing, he made many comebacks,&nbsp;none of which resulted in
significant success. <br>
<br>
In 1998 Argüello was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame.
Back home in Nicaragua he was elected as the nation's sportsman of the
20th Century in 2001. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alexis:
businessman, contra fighter, sportsman's rights campaigner <br>
<br>
</span>After
leaving professional boxing, Alexis struggled to give meaning to his
life. He began numerous business and other ventures, including taking
up acting and founding a boxing academy in his Nicaragua. He kept
himself busy, but was unable to achieve the sense of fulfillment or
passion he strived for and had found in the ring. <br>
<br>
Alexis twice
suffered major financial setbacks. As a result of his numerous world
championship wins, Alexis had earned himself a small fortune and bought
property in Managua. After the 1979 triumph of the Popular Sandinista
Revolution, however, his bank accounts were frozen and his property
confiscated. The newly established FSLN government regarded Alexis as a
Somocista given his status as an honorary member of the National Guard.
His membership of Somoza's brutal army, however, was not the result of
anti popular political leanings but a whimsical decision by Somoza to
"honour" the national boxing hero. <br>
<br>
The confiscation of his
estate angered Argüello, but the death of his brother Eduardo in combat
was the catalyst that lead him to give up his luxurious life in Miami
and join Contra troops in Costa Rica in their armed struggle against
the FSLN government. After a few months, he became disillusioned with
the struggle he had idealized, however, after witnessing first hand the
lack of comittment many Contra leaders demonstrated to the wellbeing of
their own soldiers and the population in general. <br>
<br>
Back in
Miami Argüello found his life, again, lacked direction. Prone to
depression, he struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. In the early
1990s he suffered his second financial crisis, finding himself obliged
to sell everything to pay back debts. <br>
<br>
Despite all his
difficulties, his sense of patriotism and his commitment to the cause
of social&nbsp;justice in his native Nicaragua meant his mind was
seldom far away from great social and sporting projects.<br>
<br>
Alexis'
boxing academy in Managua has helped and continues to help hundreds of
young impoverished Nicaraguans find an alternative to drug abuse and
gang culture through sport. This particular personal objective - to
help youths find an alternative through sport - he was able to promote
on a much greater scale in first as Deputy Mayor and, after defeating
Eduardo Montealegre in the muncipal elections of 2008, as Mayor of
Managua. <br>
<br>
Argüello also contributed greatly to raising
awareness among the general public and the political classes about the
need for much greater health and pension benefits for sportsmen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alexis: Mayor of
Managua</span> <br>
<br>
In
2004 Alexis became Deputy Mayor of his hometown, Managua, as part of an
alliance between the political coalition he belonged to at the
time,&nbsp;the Convergencia Nacional, and the FSLN. In the November
2008
municipal elections he won over 50% of votes in the capital, beating
the other four candidates hands down. A magnificent final victory for
the much loved national sporting hero.<br>
<br>
During his brief time as
Mayor of Managua, Argüello has managed to make significant progress in
solving the city's chaotic and desperately inefficient garbage disposal
system. He has also overseen the local government's exemplary work
complementing central government social programs including
the&nbsp;literacy
campaign and property title distribution in impoverished areas. He also
prioritised improving sports facilities for Managua's youth.<br>
<br>
Argüello,
who leaves eight children, will be remembered as one of history's most
successful and kind hearted boxing champions as well as a man of great
humililty who
never betrayed the memory of his impoverished upbringing and who
demonstrated a profound and humane desire to serve his country and his
people.<br>
