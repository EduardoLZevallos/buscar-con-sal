<p>I</p>

<p>Manipulations, libels, philias and phobias. The hegemonic industry of false witness is launched ever more viciously against Nicaragua.</p>

<p>It is that the national reality, unbearably upright, does not serve to overthrow a majority Constitutional Government.</p>

<p>That is why they display "astonishing journalistic objectivity" in this election year. Planting cacophony so as to reap collective discord and misfortune, which is what the millions of dollarspaid out since the Trump Era, are for.</p>

<p>And if they manage the information blockade well, then they move on to the economic realm projecting respectively famines, unemployment, their longed-for war and, of course, the absurd jewel of the paradox: an endless stream of migration to the United States, so as to blame the misfortunes on Sandinismo.</p>

<p>Whatever it takes to impede continuing peace and stability, inclusive socio-economic development, and whatever the ballot box resolves on November 7.</p>

<p>Let's see.</p>

<p>Framing as "the situation of the country" ...</p>

<p>... The obsession of the "crown prince" to mark again, with the rusted branding iron of his inglorious lineage, the nation he decided to destroy in 2018 out of impure ambition ...</p>

<p>... The arrogance and lies of the "Infanta" who does not accept or even measure herself with her relative in the primaries of the blue bloods, under the same heraldic shield that their caste insists on confusing with the National Shield, to dispute the Viceroyalty .</p>

<p>... the reckless fallacy of certain pedigree candidacies that "an entire people demonstrated and ended up under the criminal bullets of the dictatorship."</p>

<p>... the atrocities that some presidential hopefuls mention, without acknowledging the atrocities of burning people alive ...</p>

<p>… The worldly sermon of the assistant of the Lowest who lives in the gall of bitterness and bonds of evil…</p>

<p>… or the poisoned speech of an undemocratic minority of uninhabited NGO acronyms that claims to represent more than 6 million Nicaraguans ...</p>

<p>… It is neither ethical nor journalistic.</p>

<p>So much so that Pope Francis stressed in January that "The crisis in the publishing sector can lead to information fabricated in newsrooms, at a computer, in agency terminals, on social networks, without ever going out into the street, without 'wearing down the soles of the shoes', without finding people to look for stories ”.</p>

<p>A sad example is an agency, whose unfortunate work prolongs the latest chapter of the racist and ruthless Council of the Indies.</p>

<p>Spreading inaccuracies and lies, its mission is to anoint, according to the Chief Scriptwriter of the Indies of the Metropolis, the Viceroy and other governors.</p>

<p>Either "win or win". Or "there was electoral fraud."</p>

<p>To do this, it has a radical right-wing group or Listeners.</p>

<p>Its invariable catchphrase is "the context of a bloody crisis", as if the country lived submerged in the war provoked by Franco in 1936, or that of the Francoist Spanish State itself during the ETA terrorism.</p>

<p>However, the Iberian press did not extol the extremists, advertising them as "liberators of the Basque people." Nor did it justify them with the argument of "the deep crisis that the Spanish State has suffered since 1936."</p>

<p>What the  EFE agency did not do in its own country, when the evidence of the brutality of the Franco regime abounded, it now wants to do by supplanting the truth of its colonial story, and the murky and gloomy peninsular period of dictatorship and terror, extrapolating it to Nicaragua.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>The Style Manual of the Media Council of the Indies and the Likes, to destabilize Nicaragua, is summarized by the RAE: Disinformation: “Give intentionally manipulated information in the service of certain purposes. 2. Give insufficient information or omit it”.</p>

<p>It is the aspiration of the upright professional to bring the public, as closely as possible, to the event, to what really happened, and not to the bile of the "editor" or the complete liver of its "director".</p>

<p>False broadcasts such as "the bloody crisis" are so crude that Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, quoted in one of the disinformative notes, does not urge to stop the confrontations and shootings.</p>

<p>And in no country decimated by a prolonged conflict, with many dead, wounded and refugees, will an ecclesiastical man come out appealing for people "not to say bad words."</p>

<p>The fraudulent agency (deceptions, lies), contradicting the bile that it sells to its subscribers as "reports", conveyed the concern that any sensible person could express to maintain peace, be it in Catalonia or Managua, and not to recover it:</p>

<p>“That in this time of preparation for elections we avoid confrontations, those ugly words, the disqualification of the brother because perhaps he does not think the same as I do; no, let's listen, let's share our reasons,” urged Brenes.</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>If there have been “bloody crises” here, it is not because of the people of Rubén Darío and Augusto César Sandino. Of the 495 years, since Gil Gonzáles arrived in the country until 2018, some 300 correspond to Spain and the rest is the unpayable bill of the oligarchy and its unpatriotic treaties, deals, mistreatments and contracts.</p>

<p>Pedro Arias de Ávila continued the imperial vassalage with massacres and torture (throwing dogs to devour humans, something similar to the tranqueros-coup conspirators) against the so-called "Indians."</p>

<p>This professional decapitator acted on behalf of the Crown, and the Catholic Church glorified him by nothing less than burying him at the foot of the altar of the first temple erected in León Viejo. He was the first of the vast list of perverts who, to the undemanding religious nose, lived and died "in the odor of holiness."</p>

<p>And it continued with the horde of colonizers.</p>

<p>Then the Creole “patriots”: the oligarchy that Spain spawned in Nicaragua, twho had an absolute free run since 1821.</p>

<p>At that time, with the provinces of the isthmus, Nicaragua emancipated itself from Hispanic rule, as recorded in the General Archive of Central America, on 15 September, endorsed two years later.</p>

<p>It so “happens” that the only use that these ancestors gave to Independence, until today, was to inaugurate its cycles of wars, overthrows, coups d'état, anarchies, underdevelopment, betrayals, filibuster invasions, pacts, appeals for  interference and interventions pleaded to the United States.</p>

<p>Because "history itself began to be lived and conceived as a civil war," lamented José Coronel Urtecho.</p>

<p>And with an extraordinary inability to defend the dignity and decorum of their nation, they also dedicated themselves to professing the aggrandizement of other countries, considerably increasing their cartographies, by delivering immense extensions of our geography and continental shelf to Honduras, Costa Rica and Colombia.</p>

<p>Still not satisfied with having demolished the vast original borders, and dwarfing the country, the miscreants devoted themselves, with what was left of the National Map, to the great "masterpiece" the size of their contempt for the homeland: establishing the Banana Republic.</p>

<p>Never in universal history has so much veneration of foreign will been witnessed.</p>

<p>It "happens" that this excess of genealogical mediocrity comes from their only childish "reason" for being, which they presume "divine": they believe they were born with the presidential sash on as a diaper, with the corresponding attachments that have messed up the country.</p>

<p>It "happens" that they also directed or were involved in the human and material destruction of the nation three years ago, to remind us that their "civic virtues" are bicentennial.</p>

<p>It "happens" that the Media Council of the Indies and idem have turned the barbarism of 2018 into Festivities.</p>

<p>It so happens that with the special Festivities of the scoundrel Pablo Abrao, fired from the IACHR with more than 60 complaints, they exalted as “peaceful demonstrations of the people”, what was carried out by paramilitary and terrorist Forces: the violent kidnapping of several cities and the roadblocks of torture and death.</p>

<p>As it "happens", for a change, they are now projected as the "Mahatma Gandhi of democracy."</p>

<p>And for final clarification:</p>

<p>What Nicaraguans do, 200 years later, is to extract from the 63 thousand files of the Guatemalan warehouses, and from the documents, books, oligarchic nonsense and monuments in which two centuries have been diluted, the right to be, for the first time, Nicaragua.</p>

<p>More specifically, not to be subject to the arbitrariness and the yoke “of any other power of the old, as well as of the new world; and that they are not and should not be the property of any person or family”.</p>

<p>And this is not the slogan of the Kremlin: they are the "just sentiments" of "recovering usurped rights", by express mandate of the Decree of Independence of the National Constituent Assembly of the United Provinces of Central America, of 1 July 1823.</p>

<p>Because Independence is more than school parades, gymnastic tables and four beautiful cheerleaders. It is to set up an Act that far from the Sun and the History to be made, lies cold and inert, between 18 ° and 24 ° centigrade of postponement.</p>

<p>... well, of what value in this world is an Act in Abstract State, if it was left owing to life the main Act of Freedom:</p>

<p>The National State that the oligarchy "forgot".</p>
