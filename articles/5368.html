<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="250" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario77.jpg.html" width="400" /></p>

<p>A very good afternoon, Compañera, and a very good afternoon, Beloved Families of this Blessed, Dignified, Sovereign Patriotic Nation of Ours... Full of faith, full of love!<br />
<br />
Nicaragua lives in Christianity, Socialism and Solidarity, and we live, as we know, according to our Customs, Cultures, Traditions, building the Future, All of Us Together, All Together, because that is how we can Go Onward.</p>

<p>This morning, the BRICS Summit concluded for us, with our Foreign Minister, Compañero Valdrack Jaentschke there in Kazan.</p>

<p>I remember always the Miraculous Image of the Virgin, Our Lady of Kazan, that the Poet Alba Azucena Torres, our Ambassador, sent me some years ago, and we always venerate that Sacred Image which has accompanied the Battles and Struggles of the Peoples, and above all the Battle, the Struggle against Fascism in the Great Patriotic War. I have her in front of me, personally, all the time, Our Lady of Kazan.</p>

<p>And there in that City, where her Image is in the Basilica, in the Cathedral, this important Summit Meeting was held to promote a Multipolar World, of Fair Trade, of Mutually Beneficial and Respectful Cooperation; of, I again use the word Respect which is never superfluous, Respect for the Sovereignty of each and every People, without impositions, and, too, the search for and the promotion of Union, so as to achieve Development according to the respective Models that each Sovereign People decides.</p>

<p>At that very important Summit Meeting we expressed our Solidarity, as always, with the Russian Federation, our gratitude for the Invitation, to President Vladimir Putin, and we recognized the Great Battle that the Russian Federation is waging against Fascism financed, armed and promoted by, who else? The United States of North America! The United States which, unfortunately for the World, is the Enemy of Humanity; in fact, the United States and NATO. We have reiterated our recognition of the fundamental role that Russia and the People's Republic of China play in the world. Under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, the Russian Federation and China, with the very important Initiatives that President Xi Jinping has proposed and is developing, in Respectful Solidarity, Cooperating for Development, creating the Community of the Future, the Future towards which we are all moving and fully inhabiting from now on, this New World.</p>

<p>And we have praised all his Initiatives, the Belt and Road, for Global Security, for Global Development... Such great Hope! So much Hope with the Leaders of the BRICS, President Putin, President Xi Jinping, the other countries that currently make up this Bloc, those that were incorporated at the previous Summit Meeting, and those more than 30 Countries which are requesting our incorporation to this Path of Hope and that Destination of Justice, Peace and True Truths.</p>

<p>The BRICS are fundamental for us, for all our Countries and Peoples who defend the Right we have to be Free, for which we deeply reject those Measures, known as Sanctions, which are really, illegal measures of Aggression, Economic Measures, Financial Measures, imposed on us by the United States of North America and its Western allies by means of which  they intend to continue imposing subjugation.</p>

<p>But we are not obedient to the Imperialists of the Earth, we have been proud Combatants facing down the Imperialists and the Colonialists, and those thirsting for blood, who have imposed a genocidal policy across the World which they seek to continue dominating... via Genocide and crimes against humanity!</p>

<p>We have been Fighters, Combatants, for Peace, for Justice, for Love, and really, that's what leads us to speak out: We embrace, meet and encourage each other. We know that among the Combatants for a Better World, We are Moving Onward, building Victories, building that Future of Justice, Respect, Harmony, and above all, of Peoples free from Poverty that is the most criminal mechanism, imposed by the Colonialists and the Imperialists of the Earth to try and ensure their domination and looting of Brave Peoples and Valiant Countries, such that we do not give in to their presumptions nor do we recognize them as Leaders of a World which they have destroyed and are bent on continuing to destroy. A world in which we see crimes against humanity every day.</p>

<p>What they apply are policies of Extermination! But we have a Voice, we have a Soul, we have a Spirit, and we have the heart to say no...! The Struggle and the Battles are Certain, and the Victories are Ours.</p>

<p>We have been there, and also, as always, quoting our Immortal Rubén Darío: Peace, Peace, Peace, for a World of a Bright and Shared Future, a World for Humanity, a World of Respect, I say again, because that word is never superfluous, it must be emphasized every day; Harmony, Brotherhood, Solidarity, Cooperation, Justice, Reparation that we deserve so much, and Peace, Peace, Peace...! This is how We Go Onward, demanding what is a Fundamental Right of Peoples: The Right to live peacefully, securely and in Peace.</p>

<p>And compañeras and compañeros, as part of the Achievements of Peace that we defend so much, as part of those Achievements which the Enemies of Peace, the Enemies of Progress, the Enemies of the Rights of Peoples, seek always to deprecate ... Because we live in Peace, we can announce today, as we announced yesterday the raises in salary, we can announce today too  that we will be delivering the Baccalaureate Bonus consisting of 3,000 córdobas in the coming weeks to 63,717 new High School graduates, if they all pass their exams in the Public Education System, which our President approved last year, because it was increased, the President attentive as always, our Comandante Daniel, to ensure that all these actions reach Nicaragua's Families directly.</p>

<p>Yesterday when we noted the salary increase, the leveling up of the basic pay for the Families Working in the State Institutions, we saw there the result of a constant concern of our Comandante who has been attentive, precisely, to making sure we could now achieve that pay rise.</p>

<p>And well, Peace and Work, Work and Peace, as we have said ever since we set out  to to recover the Government for the People, a Nicaraguan State for Work and Peace, since with Work and Peace we can make ever more progress, on a path and in a process increasing salaries so that we can exercise our Right to Live with Dignity, to Live Better.</p>

<p>Those Salaries and Baccalaureate Bonuses go directly to Families, which is why, when we make these announcements, we have to look to the Families, we have to look for Commerce, the business activity of our Family Economy which, Thanks be to God, we see developing everywhere, to the Producer Families, to the Cooperatives, to tell them, how really, all of this benefits everyone and are advances made possible because we have Peace.</p>

<p>That Peace which we strive to protect as the Principal Treasure, the Essential Heritage, the Right of our People after we have given so much in order to live as we live and to protect that Heritage, that Treasure, as we protect all our Traditions, Identity and Culture, as part of our Rights, of which our Essential and Primary Right is Peace...!</p>

<p>Peace with Security, the Sovereignty too that guarantees us Peace with Security, the Work and the Protagonism of all our Families, of the Nicaraguan People in Direct Democracy. We have always spoken of Direct Democracy, our Comandante Daniel has made Direct Democracy the central theme in all his Campaigns, namely the Right of the People to be listened to, to have rights, to work, to prosper, to progress.</p>

<p>Direct Democracy, Sovereignty, Security, Peace, such a great Heritage that we must protect every day: The role of Families and Communities.<br />
Around 192 million córdobas are being invested from the General Budget of the Republic, on the instructions of our Comandante Daniel, in this Bonus to ensure Educational Continuity for almost 64,000 new High School graduates.</p>

<p>We do have a Patriotic Nation...! There is a Nation...! There Is A Future...! There are young people learning, undertaking, developing in every possible space...! There is a Nation, and because there is a Patriotic Nation, there is Peace, and because there is Peace, because there is a Nation, so there are Patriots in this Nicaragua of National Dignity. Quite apart are those who do not love their Nation and betray it. But there is a Patriotic Nation here and we are Going Onward!<br />
