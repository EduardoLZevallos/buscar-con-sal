<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><b>in the Midday Edition of Multinoticias on Channel 4</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><b>October 16th 2024</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Good afternoon, Compañera. Good afternoon, beloved Families. What beautiful days we are living...! What beautiful afternoons...! Such Beautiful Times, Bright Times, while at all Times we are Worthy Descendants of our Heroes, of our Martyrs... Worthy Defenders of our National Sovereignty, which is the Guarantee of the Luminous Peace we now have. We are a worthy example of the Proud Succession of our Immortal forebears.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Our Immortals...! When we say that, one's heart fills with greatness. So much Heroism, so much Heroic Heritage that we have in our Nicaragua, so much to show us the Paths traveled, with Bravery, with Integrity that is Inspired by the Sublime Spirit of Providence. Because God commands us to live with Dignity and to live as Brothers and Sisters, and this is what we have sought to do through the Centuries in our Nicaragua, and we are, and we say so with Courage, with a Sense of profound Enlightenment, we are Proud Successors of our Immortals.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Yesterday, when celebrating those Centuries of Heroic Struggle, our Comandante Daniel, celebrating us all as an Inspiration of the People, of Heroes, of our Blessed Nicaragua, and when celebrating along with those Centuries of Inspiring, Exemplary Struggle, the 45 years of the MINT and the National Police, Daniel said: Sandino Lives in everyone of us, and he remembered our General, betrayed by those who always hate, a betrayal by the servile, a betrayal by cowards, and the betrayal of those who think they own the world.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And when we remember his Feat which filled us all with Courage, decades have passed, but there was Sandino and here is Sandino, and when we remember the betrayal we know that it is up to us to defend Peace in the face of all the traitors and cowards, who are indeed there, but only, thank God, in another World, which is not the Best World and nor this Sublime World. No...! But the world of iniquity.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Daniel said: Sandino Lives in all of us, and the Struggle Continues, with all of us. Because that's how it is. The Struggle continues, with all of us, because we, together with our forebears, are the same, still with all the Strength, Courage, Inspiration, Legend of Formidable Struggles, of Great Spirits, that is our Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And in those moments when Daniel was speaking last night, I remembered those Songs, those brave Slogans, those Times and now in these Times, because as we say, the Struggle Continues, with everyone, and yes we are the same, those whose Love for Nicaragua is engraved with Holy Blood in our Lives, in our Ways, in our Hearts. We are the same, valiant Defenders of our inviolable National Sovereignty.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We were wondering, as we were wondering yesterday and the day before: Are we tired...? We answered each other: No...! And when we wondered: Why not...? And we answered to each other: Because we are Sandino's Children, and the Children of Sandino Neither Sell Out, Nor Surrender, Ever! And so here we are, in this real World, fighting always with Pride, with National Dignity; fighting in this healthy, wholesome World, full of Strength and Hope. We know that we are making our way in this real world, and we know that we are Moving Onward.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That other sick, decrepit World has no Inspiration, no Hope, no Grasp, no Certainty, because there they are... And who are they? Who inhabits that world? The gross dregs of what never could be. Human wretchedness. The perpetrators of actual crimes against humanity and of treason against their Nation. A Nation that is sacred to us.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And they are stateless now, because they have no nation, because they betrayed their Patriotic Nation, and they continue playing at make believe, with slander and vulgarity. Hatred is vulgar, wretched. They play at living where they no longer live and at being what they no longer are, what they can no longer be, because they do not love, because they have shown they hate Nicaragua, and hate Nicaragua's people. Those of us who love Nicaragua are, with pride, Nicaraguans by the Grace of God!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In that sick World of theirs, they concoct all the crimes, every misery, all the baseness, every sorrow. They live like gloomy zombies, decreeing aggression after aggression, willing destruction, but unwilling to see this Bright and Luminous Nicaragua. Of course, she is no longer theirs, and does not belong to them, she doesn't clean up their dung heaps, because here there are none... Here there are Sublime, Sacrosanct Realities.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Their Odious World has no place here, because here we are Undefeated Warriors of Love and Daily Builders of Peace, Security, Labor and Well-being, that is what counts, that is what we see, that is what we live, these are the days of those who have Faith and Strength which we live out truly... the Strength of our Courage and Rights, of True Truths, of Justice, and of so much Hope.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Here we are, in this Real World, this World of Light, of Life, of Truth... It is this Heroic World through which we all go together every day, carving out our Future. Upright, on our own feet, that's how we are, Always standing tall, Always Onward. In that other world, their vulgarity whips them, scourges them, and it is their own ignominy that they swallow, their disgusting illusions, since they have no dreams, but nightmares. Theirs is the macabre, the world of zombies, a sinister world and all as the result of their own ignorance and servility.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">There are no songs, no flowers for them, only their tragic Inferno of vileness, cruelty, immorality, falsehood... Their defeat, their iniquity... Their defeat because They Could Not Prevail, Cannot Prevail, Nor Will They, against the Power of Love and Peace.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's what we saw yesterday and that's what we live every day: How committed we are, how responsible we are, committed to that Peace which Is All of Us. And it is with Peace, it's with Security, it's with Love, a unique and great Word, that the Future is built.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">This Reality, this Reality of All of Us, where We Move Onward, where Peace thrives in 94.3% of the National Consciousness... Where people know, Our People know that there is Economic and Social Stability... Where they breathe Peace, as the Families and the Communities say so, by 94.9%, that is to say 95%... Where we live in Freedom, in Democracy, and our People say so by more than 60%. 63% say that we have real opportunities to improve life, that there are Choices... Only 11% that there is no Security, while 91% of the Population talks about Dialogue, Unity, Democracy, Security. But in any case, Compañeras and Compañeros, we are All United.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Here 92% of our people think, believe that we live in freedom. There are 95.4% who say, fundamental Rights are respected. Those others have no idea. They don't have a clue. Since they are not from here, but from there, from hellish places, whereas here we strive, day by day, to live out the Kingdom of God on Earth, Brother and Sisterhood, Solidarity, Rights and the Hope of building the Society that we want, that we dream of, a Society of Well Being.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">There are Rights here, there are Equal Rights and Duties, 88% of the Population says; 82.8% say that Democracy works; and 76.6% of our population identify with what the Sandinista National Liberation Front does, with the Ideology and Practice of the Common Good, Christian, Socialist, Solidarity-inspired.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Then also, Compañeras and Compañeros, we have the Leadership of our Comandante Daniel with 83% approval and for the direction in which the Country is heading under the Government of President Daniel, 82.8. And such numbers... 85.1% say that our President seeks Unity and Reconciliation. We have recovered those values they wanted to snatch away from us; we have insisted that National Reconciliation is the Guarantee of Peace, Security and the Right of Everyone to Live for the Common Good.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So much positive, the great Security, say the Compañeras and Compañeros who took part in this Opinion Survey, and one really does feel Great, Great in Spirit, Great as a Human Being, because Human Beings come to this Plane of Life to learn to be Great, which means, to learn to live, to live together, to share, to be in Solidarity.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And that is what makes one feel great. Why? Why not...? Because I feel, we sense, we perceive that we have come to value the Sense of Humanity which must prevail in all things, and to value ourselves as a Heroic, Victorious, Hardworking, Combative People... People making our way, people who Go Onward... A Christian People, a Socialist People a Solidarity-inspired People.</p>
