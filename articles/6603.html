<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY<br />
OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA AT THE IV MINISTERIAL MEETING OF THE CHINA-CELAC FORUM</strong></p>

<p><strong>Date: Wednesday, May 13, 2025<br />
<br />
Venue: Beijing, People's Republic of China</strong></p>

<p>Dear Comrade and Brother Wang Yi, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China;</p>

<p>Mr. Gustavo Petro, President of the Republic of Colombia and President Pro Tempore of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC);</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers, Presidents, Foreign Ministers and Heads of Delegation;</p>

<p>Dear Friends.</p>

<p>First of all, allow me to convey the Warm and Fraternal Greetings of the Co-Presidents of the Republic of Nicaragua, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Comrade Rosario Murillo Zambrana. Greetings to Comrade Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, to the Communist Party of China, and to the Chinese People and Government. Likewise, Greetings to all participants in this important meeting.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is here, first and foremost, to reaffirm our Sisterhood and Brotherhood with China, based on the Historic Ties between the Communist Party of China and the Sandinista Front for National Liberation.</p>

<p>We are here to express our deepest gratitude to China for the unconditional cooperation we have been developing in all fields since 2021, when we reestablished diplomatic relations. We are also here to reiterate our firm commitment to expand the bonds of cooperation that unite us for the good of our Peoples.</p>

<p>Nicaragua and China have been advancing at an accelerated speed towards what our leaders have called a Strategic Partnership. We are fully engaged in and supporting all the global initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping: the Global Development Initiative, the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Initiative for Sharing among Civilizations, and the Artificial Intelligence Governance Initiative. These initiatives pave the way, giving us a ray of hope for how to move towards a better world, of peaceful harmony and shared benefits.</p>

<p>Nicaragua and China have been developing our cooperation based on three pillars. The first pillar is China's solidarity cooperation through the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA). The second pillar is the promotion of trade and investment with China. And the third pillar is the strategic projects of the Nicaraguan State with major companies from the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p>We wish to highlight the holding of China-Latin America and the Caribbean Business Summit, in November 2024, which was organized in Managua with the China Council for Investment and Trade Promotion (CCPIT). This Summit included the special participation of Co-Presidents Comandante Daniel Ortega and Compañera Rosario Murillo, an official delegation led by Comrade Yang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping, and more than 400 Chinese business leaders.<br />
<br />
At this event, Co-President Daniel Ortega presented the Nicaraguan Great Interoceanic Canal project to Chinese business leaders, inviting Chinese companies to participate in this project, which today is more necessary and urgent than ever, given the demands of maritime freight transit and the uncertainty created by the imperialist policies and actions of the United States.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>At this meeting, we wish to recognize the global leadership of President Xi Jinping and China, in times when the unilateralism of the United States is attempting to impose itself by force, with economic aggressions that violate the norms, treaties and laws of global trade.</p>

<p>We stand in solidarity with China in the tariff trade war launched by the US government. While it is true that it has been against the entire world, the most brutal blow has been against China, which they consider their main threat. We wish to reiterate that the threat against the world is the United States, who does not accept that other Peoples can achieve development with their own models and government system, with their own cultures and their own criteria.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is well aware of this. Historically, the United States has sought to dominate us, but the Spirit of Rubén Darío and General Sandino, the firm leadership of our Co-Presidents Comandante Daniel Ortega and Comrade Rosario Murillo, and the Strength, Courage, Dignity and Valor of the Nicaraguan People allow us to resist and advance in Victories, restoring the rights of our People and working to eradicate extreme poverty in Nicaragua, following the example of the Great China.</p>

<p>Dear Comrades,</p>

<p>Today we also wish to reiterate our rejection and condemnation to all the illegal aggressions launched by the United States and its European and Canadian allies against the Peoples of the World who do not subdue to the imperial boot. We strongly reject the illegal sanctions applied against China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and other Sister Countries.</p>

<p>We condemn the criminal blockade imposed against the Brotherly People of Cuba, the Heroic Cuba of Fidel, of Raúl and of Miguel Díaz-Canel.</p>

<p>We reject and remain alert to the ongoing attempts to destabilize and carry out coups d'état in our Latin American and Caribbean Region, by using the soft coup guideline, as well as the hard coup, as we have experienced firsthand.</p>

<p>We remember what they did in Venezuela in 2002 against the Eternal Comandante, the giant Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías, and what we experienced in Nicaragua in 2018: bloody and terrorist coup attempts, which promotes hatred and disunity.</p>

<p>We also reject and denounce the continuous disinformation campaigns carried out by the Western media against China, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, by ignoring the enormous achievements of our Governments in guaranteeing the full rights of our citizens.</p>

<p>Friends,</p>

<p>At this meeting, we must continue to raise our voices against the Genocide of the Palestinian People by the Government of Israel, supported by the United States. We demand justice for the Palestinian Government and People and their right to exist.</p>

<p>And from this place, we also reiterate our permanent support and solidarity with the Russian Federation in this new battle they are waging against the Nazism, which has taken root in the NATO-backed Ukrainian Government. After eighty years of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War against Nazism, the enemy remains the same, and Russia once again demonstrates its sacrifice and dedication towards world peace.</p>

<p>Today, we must also denounce the inhumane and illegal actions taken by the United States Government against immigrants, especially our Latin American and Caribbean Brothers and Sisters. We condemn the criminalization and the degrading and shameful treatment they are receiving. We demand an end to this racist and xenophobic practice.</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>At this meeting, we call for unity, cooperation and understanding among the Peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, based on the Principles of Respect for the Sovereignty and Dignity of each People, non-interference and non-conditionality. We must recognize each other as Sisters and Brothers who face the same enemy: poverty and underdevelopment.</p>

<p>We must recognize China as a friendly and respectful country that brings us development, cooperation and prosperity, a country that shares its great achievements and progress with all of us without imposing conditions. Unlike the United States and Europe, which historically see us as servants, China sees us as equals, as Brothers and Sisters who must cooperate together for the common good.</p>

<p>Thus, today we are pleased to support the Declaration of the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum and the Joint Action Plan 2025-2027 as important elements for expanding our cooperation with China.</p>

<p>Finally, we reiterate our firm support to the One China Principle, our support for all of China's efforts to promote and achieve the reunification of this great People, as well as our firm support to China on the issues related to Hong Kong and Xinjiang.</p>

<p>We thank the Government of China for organizing this event and we reiterate our firm determination to advance on the building of a shared destiny for humanity under the leadership of President Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
