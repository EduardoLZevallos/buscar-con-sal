              14th 2011</span><br>
            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : Can you tell us about CARUNA's role in
            the management of ALBA funds?<br>
            <br>
            Jorge Alberto Martinez : CARUNA RL is the legal entity in
            Nicaragua that holds and administers the ALAB funds, both
            the funds freed up from the oil account, 50% of which is a
            long term credit, and too the credits made available to
            Nicaragua via the Venezuelan Economic and Social Development
            Bank, BANDES. And we also play a facilitating role taking
            advantage of CARUNA's branch network of 35 offices
            throughout Nicaragua, by means of which we have been able to
            deliver the flagship programmes promoted by President Daniel
            Ortega and Rosario Murillo. <br>
            <br>
            For example, one of the programmes that has made most
            impact, in my opinion, is the Zero Usury programme which is
            a project whereby women receive small credits at highly
            favourable interest rates, 3% on the balance annually. This
            has helped more than 90,000 women at this point. And this
            programme has helped renew the economies of families in
            Nicaragua, with particular emphasis on women.<br>
            <br>
            Another programme that has had a big impact from my point of
            view is Zero Hunger which has brought cows, pigs, chickens
            and vegetables into the reach of Nicaraguan families to help
            with food supply and to contribute to the food sovereignty
            of women in our country, beacuse it is another program aimed
            at women.<br>
            <br>
            Another of the important programmes has been the programme
            of collection and distribution of basic grains carried out
            by the National Basic Foods Company (ENABAS), with help from
            ALBA's donations and loans. These supply a network of more
            than 3500 distribution points, small shops across the
            country and these provide products to the Nicaraguan
            population at truly fair prices.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : How are the social and production investment funds
            structured?<br>
            <br>
            Jorge Martinez : 50% of the oil account held and managed by
            CARUNA we administer via two important components. A social
            component which to date has carried out over 50 projects in
            the three and a half years we have been running them and we
            have assigned 38% to those social projects. And 62% of those
            funds we have assigned to our country's productive sector.<br>
            <br>
            To give you an example, right now we are funding thousands
            of producers throughout the country to strengthen the family
            economy and promote food independence and food sovereignty,
            with US$18 million for the first, second and third harvests
            mainly for maize, rice and beans. On instructions from
            President Ortega and Rosario, we are calling this programme
            CRISSOL which means Christian, Socialist and
            Solidarity-based. Nad this is part of the social-productive
            programmes we are managing with a component of 62% of the
            funds freed up as long terms credits.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : What controls are there on CARUNA's use of the ALBA
            funds?<br>
            <br>
            Jorge Martinez : CARUNA complies with all the norms
            established in the country for a Savings and Loan
            Cooperative. It presnets its annual audited accounts to the
            national Institute for Cooperative Development,. It presents
            its reports on private debt and funds received to two
            institutions. One is the Central Bank and the other is the
            Foreign Ministry's development cooperation office. In 2010
            we requested a formal letter from teh national Bank
            Superintendent confirming that CARUNA complies with
            Nicaragua's laws and that all its operations satisfy that
            legal framework.<br>
            <br>
            At the request of the Central Bank, we have appeared more
            than three times&nbsp; to give presentations to officials of
            the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to
            clarify to them some of their concerns in relation to the
            use and investment of the funds and their beneficiaries in
            Nicaragua. And we have given them concrete data about how
            much has been invested in social programmes. We have given
            them the data on how much has been invested in productive
            programmes. They have asked us if any of this constitutes
            public sector debt and we have told them no.<br>
            <br>
            They have asked us if we manage our bank accounts
            responsibly, if we're going to maintain financial
            responsibility and not suddenly withdraw funds from the
            banking system and we have explained to them that, no, our
            role is to assist the government in Nicaragua to keep
            inflation under control, keep the economy growing,
            contribute to the growth in exports and always be at the
            government's disposal to work in line with the programme of
            human development promoted by the government of President
            Ortega.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : What has been ALBA impact on Nicaragua's economy?<br>
            <br>
            Jorge Martinez : Nicaragua's Vice -Minister for Finance said
            in one of Petrocaribe's technical summit here that
            Nicaragua's growth, even in 2008&nbsp; - which was a year of
            global financial crisis beacuse there was much talk over
            what was caused by the US housing sector and other factors -
            even in 2008, Nicaragua had positive export growth, the same
            in 2009 and in 2010 the same with more emphasis still on
            growth in exports and the consolidation of exports. Perhaps
            without ALBA the economic situation in our country would
            have been very different.<br>
            <br>
            One of the biggest achievements that can be attributed to
            this alliance, to this Latin American and Caribbean Union is
            that here in Nicaragua, President Ortega ended the power
            cuts that were as long as 14 hours. With energy, with
            stability we can see a change in the country's economy,
            above all because those resources and that change are
            reaching the people who really need it.<br>
