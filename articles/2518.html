<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Address by Daniel</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Beloved Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, beloved families of this Land... as Dario used to say, even if one's nation is small, one dreams of it being great. No Patriotic Nation is small!<br />
<br />
And we are precisely in this Month of the Patriotic Nation, whereby this small country, Nicaragua, in the years of the last century or rather the century before, 1850 to 55, in that period, when the capitalists, imperialists, were already disputing how to transit through Nicaragua, the transit route that would take those people who were eager for gold, from New York to San Francisco. And in fact, they realized that it was safer to make the route by sea crossing over the Lake here in Nicaragua via the San Juan River.<br />
<br />
That's where the North American companies organized themselves to fight for that route and that way thousands of people from United States crossed our country, some stayed here in Nicaragua, while others continued the route to the West Coast of the United States, because that's where the gold was, and they were seeking after gold, whereas crossing the North American territory was a great risk, with a lot of danger, since there was still indigenous resistance and then too there were the bandits and criminals who attacked the wagon trains of the people who decided to travel across the North American territory from one coast to another. So then this became a route that gave a lot of security to US citizens, the men and women who crossed our territory.<br />
<br />
And it was precisely then in the month of February that this tiny territory, with a tiny population, but with men and women of courage, as our People have always had, courage, dignity, dealt the first defeat to the Yankee invaders, to the Yankee expansionists, who had been called by one of the political parties concerned to support them in their dispute over the route, so that it could be awarded to another company that was in collusion with that Party. And the invaders came... And here I have this book “The National War".<br />
<br />
This month of September is the month of the Patriotic Nation, because this was when Nicaragua became a Patriotic Nation, and already in the days of this month, confrontations were taking place with the invading Yankee who had called elections and in the month of October of the year 1855 he demanded of the political leaders in Nicaragua who were vying for Power, the Liberals and Conservatives, at that time he demanded of the President during the conflict in Nicaragua, who was President Rivas, that there had to be elections. And they organized the polls, several lent themselves to participate in the voting, and also voting was the invading Yankee filibuster, William Walker.<br />
<br />
The elections took place, just imagine, and by September 1856, William Walker was President of Nicaragua. The writer, the historian here says: “In comedy cynicism is often the main element. In Walker's tragi-comedy representing the dark side of the human soul was the Resident Minister of the United States in Nicaragua”; that is to say, the Ambassador, and the writer points it out there, why? Because the ambassador handed over, participated in Walker's recognition.<br />
<br />
In this month of our Patriotic Nation we are now approaching that historic date of the defense of the Nation, facing an enemy who was more powerful in armament, in military experience, and defeating it. And it remains for history and to the shame of the Yankee rulers, the defeat they suffered in San Jacinto, with General José Dolores Estrada at the head, and with Andrés throwing that stone when he ran out of ammunition; he did not run away, but took stones from the stone walls where they were entrenched and threw them and managed to knock down more than one Yankee.<br />
<br />
We are in the month of the Patriotic Nation when we will have Events of Commemoration of this 167th Anniversary of the first defeat suffered by the Yankees here in Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
Today, September 11th marks the 50th anniversary of an abominable, cowardly event, on the part of those who claim to have been and are said to be defenders of democracy and human rights. 50 years ago today, there was a coup like the one that the sell-out traitors long for here, there was a coup against the socialist President of the sister Republic of Chile, against the Hero President, the Martyr President, who did not give up and said so in his message, when the Presidential Palace was already surrounded by tanks and war planes were already approaching to bomb it. There was President Salvador Allende resisting. </span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="http://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/371200.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">A coup d'état that was organized by the sell-out traitors that exist in the World, and in this case with the sell-out traitors that exist in Chile. There are still sell-outs in Chile longing for Pinochet. It was an open conspiracy, an open intervention by the United States of America, which conspired with Pinochet, planning to promote boycotts, strikes, seeking to provoke discontent among the population.<br />
<br />
But since the population did not rebel against their government, the first socialist government in Chile, what they did was to carry out the brutal plan that remains for history; there are the images of the soldiers, of the tanks, the image of President Allende, with a helmet and a rifle resisting there with 40 comrades in the Presidency, and the war planes then bombing and murdering the 40 heroic comrades who with their Heroic President, giving up their lives rather than surrender to the Imperialists.<br />
<br />
Because that was a coup d'état organized, blessed, applauded by the Imperialists and by the governments of the time in Latin America and Western Europe, who did not want a People’s government, neither in their own countries nor in any other country. And when suddenly the socialist government appeared in Chile, they thought: Here comes an epidemic and more socialist governments are going to come.<br />
<br />
So it was a total conspiracy in which there were no major condemnations of this crime on the part of the Imperialists, on the contrary, they applauded it, supported it and maintained it.<br />
<br />
The stadium of Chile, where an event was supposed to take place today, that stadium was filled with young Chilean brothers and sisters and they were murdered for being socialists. And that extraordinary, revolutionary singer, Víctor Jara, was captured and his hands cut off so that he couldn't play the guitar, and then he was killed, he was murdered! Thousands and thousands were murdered and thousands more were disappeared who still do not appear. It was a genocide! That is, a crime against humanity.<br />
<br />
It is not possible for the human rights organizations to remain passive without opening a process that leads to punishing the murderers who are organized there, who have political parties and have political force. That is to say, they have managed to divide the Chilean people, and 44% of the population still to this day longs for Fascism and still longs for fascist-style parties, admirers of Pinochet, to come to government in Chile.<br />
<br />
There are the forces of the People, it is true, there are the sectors of the People, but then there are the carabineros, and the Chilean carabineros are not like Nicaragua’s National Police, they are trained in mass murder, the carabineros, nor is the Chilean Army like Nicaragua’s Army, rather they are trained to murder the People, workers, peasants, simply because Allende promoted programs in favor of the impoverished, in favor of peasants, in favor of workers. It was simply that there the sell-outs joined with the military led by Pinochet and began provoking boycotts so that people would get fed up with the government.<br />
<br />
A 50th Anniversary, and our veneration, our admiration, our recognition to the Martyr President Salvador Allende and the thousands of Chileans who were murdered, to the families of the disappeared, and we are sure that in Chile there stands the example, there stands the strength, the dignity of President Salvador Allende. It is in the people, it is in the poor, and the time will come when, as Allende said in his last message, the broad avenues of Freedom and Justice will become open.<br />
<br />
Because although this is a country with forces of the People that were victims of Pinochet, on the other hand there are the forces of the Right that have immense economic power... they have the economic power, they have the military power, and the initiatives that people have tried to take in the National Assembly have not been able to advance, because there is that barrier where they openly shout down the progressive forces, the revolutionary forces of Chile’s Youth, a brave, combative Youth.<br />
<br />
Here, we must remember the Chilean brothers and sisters who came to fight and who fell, joining the struggle against the tyranny imposed by the Yankees here in Nicaragua. We have had supportive brothers and sisters and we still have supportive brothers and sister, but the conditions there are hard. As long as those fascist forces have legitimacy in Chile, there will be no democracy in Chile.<br />
<br />
That's how Hitler came to power and those conditions that could not be removed are still being maintained there, because they are there. In other words, the battle is set and we are sure, yes, that the time will come when the great avenues will be opened, as Allende said, for working people, for Youth, for peasants, for socialists, for communists, for revolutionaries, who have marched and in this first march the Carabineros turned out to repress them. Ah, but there is no pronouncement of condemnation there, no human rights body condemns that repression.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">But here we pay tribute on this day, on this 50th Anniversary, to President Salvador Allende and to the thousands of Heroes and the Heroic People who continue to fight, to the Heroic People of Chile who have not lost their strength, which, with his example, they inherited from President Salvador Allende.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">On a day like today, too, September 11, 2001, there was the terrorist attack where planes were launched that were taken over along with their passengers, and the planes were crashed into the Twin Towers, there in New York, 22 years ago today.<br />
<br />
A fact that we condemned at the time, just as we condemn the terrorist practices of the US rulers, we condemn that crime where more than 300 firefighters died heroically, firefighters, yes, with great courage, with a great spirit of solidarity, and more than 3,000 citizens of different countries died in total, why? Because they were buildings with thousands of people inside including people from this region.<br />
<br />
A crime that we condemned at the time and in relation to which, today, on this 22nd Anniversary, we stand in solidarity with the families of the North American, Latin American, Asian and other citizens from other regions who died as a result of these acts of terrorism. We stand in solidarity with the US people.<br />
<br />
And too, today, on this day, on this date when we are commemorating the 44th Anniversary of the National Police, we salute First Commissioner General Francisco Díaz, we salute Commander-in-Chief of the Nicaraguan Army, General Julio César Avilés. Two instruments in the service of Peace: The Police and the Army, with the People, defending Peace. We also greet all the compañeros and compañeras who are presiding, who have been introduced, and their relatives.</span><br />
 </p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="http://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/371214.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p>Likewise, our appreciation, our affection for the People of Russia, a fraternal People that has always been present, offering solidarity to the Nicaraguan people. And here with us, Colonel General Oleg Anatolyevich Plokhoy, State Secretary and Deputy Director of the Federal Troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation.<br />
<br />
What will the coup plotters, the sell-out traitors say? They are will say that this compañero was sent, that President Putin sent him to assemble atomic bombs here in Nicaragua. Yes, the madness of these people goes that far, they will utter any barbarity, any lie, any infamy, any slander, trying to deceive the Nicaraguan people. They set about inventing such things every day.<br />
<br />
But no. The General is here to cooperate, as they have been doing, with a Center here in Nicaragua and from where the brothers and sisters of the Russian Federation, from their military specialized in the subject, carry out courses in which the entire Central American Region and, of course, our National Police participate. What for?<br />
<br />
So as to better confront drug trafficking, organized crime, so as to better confront the coup plotters, to better confront the terrorists... Of course! Because here, as Commission General Diaz has rightly said, we are defending peace.<br />
<br />
It is easy for Nicaraguans to reflect for a moment about what happened in Nicaragua in April. It was terror, it was a blockade, provoked by terrorists paid by the Yankees and by some European countries; it was murder, it was torture, and the burning of compañeros and compañeras, so many fellow students, fellow police officers, they tortured them and then burned them. And they filmed it, let's remember that, they filmed it themselves, because they believed that the coup attempt had already triumphed.<br />
<br />
They were three months of blockade across the country, blockaded and with all the artillery of the pro-imperialist community of Latin America and Europe, with their media firing slanders and lies, trying to justify the crime that US imperialism was committing here once again.<br />
<br />
And leter, when the time came to dismantle the notorious roadblocks, because the People asked for that, the People demanded it, when we had the Police in their quarters, the time came to restore order in the country, to restore Peace, and there naturally the Police set out, with the Volunteer Police, they set our and we quickly dismantled the infamous Roadblocks of Death.<br />
<br />
Today, on this 44th Anniversary, the cowards, the sell-out traitors, the <span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><i>machistas</i></span><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">, speaking out because we are complying with a principle that is far from new, which is that, in the directorates of our institutions, in the National Assembly, in the municipalities, we have stipulated, 50% Men, 50% Women. And thus the attention to women with all the Women’s Offices that have been organized across the country, Women’s Offices organized with the Police, with police compañeras attending to Families, visiting Families.<br />
<br />
After all, this step needed to be taken now, it needed to be taken in the directorates, in the departmental level Police Offices, in all the Departments of the Country. And what does that mean? Where previously there were only male compañeros in command, now women compañeras join them with the corresponding rank of Commissioner General, a Co-Directorate to defend Peace.<br />
<br />
They are all compañeras and compañeros from different regions of the country, with a long commitment to the People, of service to the People. And today we can now say that we are making a qualitative leap in worldwide terms. I don’t think the Police of any other country in the world have established this type of system, such that in all the main police offices we have a Co-Directorate, that there is a man joined by a woman, or where a woman is joined by a man.<br />
<br />
I was talking to the compañeras when we were awarding them their ranks, and they are all combative women, who confronted the terrorists in April 2018, without hesitation, and they have maintained their work selflessly. And they have children, of course, and they have to make the sacrifice of seeing their children only when time permits them to go home, but they are proud, they feel proud.<br />
<br />
And here this is a historic fact, of course it is a historic fact. But why is it historic? The coup plotters, the sell-out traitors have been calling out against the appointment of women compañeras to senior positions at the departmental level. In fact, it will hurt these coup mongers all the more if they insist on their acts of terrorism, when these women comrades catch them and grab them by the hair wherever they set out to try and sow terror.<br />
<br />
Beloved Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, beloved families, today we have paid tribute to the Heroes and Martyrs of the National Police with a minute of silence, a minute in which we ratify our commitment to them, who are still present with us.<br />
<br />
But we must not let our guard down, I was telling the compañeras and compañeros, we must not let our guard down, as I said to them, we must not be too trusting, because the enemy is the same one at whom Andrés threw that stone 167 years ago... It's still the same one! And the enemy should know that this is a People with institutions of men and women with Dignity, with Patriotic Love for their Nation. Who Do Not Sell Out and Do Not Surrender, Ever!<br />
<br />
Long live the National Police on this 44th Anniversary!<br />
<br />
Sandino Lives on, the Struggle Continues!<br />
<br />
A Free Nation or Death!<br />
<br />
Good night. But first, let me also salute Comandante Doris Tijerino, who was Head of the National Police, and our brother guerrilla Comandante René Vivas, who was also Head of the National Police.</span></p>

after the Central Celebration of the 44th Anniversary of the National Police<br />
<br />
September 11th 2023</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Good evening, on this day and this night of intense emotions, of great memories, of great invocations, in honor of great human beings; this day on which falls the 50th Anniversary of the Heroism of the Combatant-President Salvador Allende, who along with his People was sacrificed to further the corrupt interests of Empires.<br />
<br />
Today, as we celebrate our National Police, we have recalled the struggle of this Sandinista Police, our National Police, against criminals, and I'm not talking about just common criminals, I'm talking about political criminals, traitors, those cowards and traitors who have insulted the dignity of Nicaragua’s People, but who have found themselves, precisely because we are a Worthy People, with the infinite Dignity that has shaped us, They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They!<br />
<br />
Here is this People, here is this Police, this Army, of Sandino, of Zeledón... We are a Dignified, Combative and Victorious People! We celebrate the Life of all the compañeras and compañeros who have given their all to Our Nicaragua, we celebrate their Living Memory and their Living Example that is in all of us and in particular in their families, to whom we send immense embraces.<br />
<br />
We celebrate too the Victorious Hopes that illuminate us, because here those Victorious Hopes are those of a Sun that does not set, a Sun that now announces all the great Victories that make us grow in Confidence, grow in Militancy, grow in Loyalty, grow in vocation of Service to Nicaragua’s Families, and each one of us their servants are part of the Heroic Nicaraguan Family, which inspires us every day with the ability to transcend, to make our way, to work, to overcome.<br />
<br />
Many Memories, much Admiration in those Memories, much Determination and Conviction that the Future is ours, that we are building it, that we are a People, Blessed, Miraculous, Portentous a People of that God of All Victories who guides us. Because we are also, in the first place, a People of Faith, a People of Values, of Family; a People committed, because we are Christians, to Social Justice, to Genuine Truth, to our History of National Dignity, and the Memory of Courage, of Heroism, of Nobility.<br />
<br />
A People who, in the face of the deafness of Empires failing to answer calls for Justice, in the sense of the repeated call for reparations of all the destruction and suffering, we have set about first of all restoring ourselves, and making our way with the Strength that God gives us to advance, step by step, recovering as Spiritual Beings, and recovering our Material Life.<br />
<br />
There, whenever some coup leader and terrorist calls for more aggression against Nicaragua, there is a Family working, striving, overcoming, that does Overcome and goes Forward, because they have, because we all have, a Good Heart!<br />
<br />
A Day of Memory, a day for demanding and affirming each one of us as Combatants for Love, No Repetition! Because not only here, as Paquita said, no one gives in. As Leonel Rugama said “Let your mother surrender,", and we too come from that Heroic Story.<br />
<br />
They cannot be allowed to attack our Concord. They cannot be allowed to play with Peace again, to abuse Peace, which is the Treasure we have, the Heritage we have, the inheritance of hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans who have given their lives for us to be able to live peacefully, safely, working, content, with the Joy of Living in Peace, of working to Prosper, and we have the Right to all that.<br />
<br />
A Day that is also a Message : that Peace is not to be trifled with! A day that is a Prophetic Vision: We have a Nation, we have Peace. Because There is a Nation, There Is Peace! And the Prophetic Vision is this Luminous, Joyful Nicaragua, inaugurating every day the Programs, the Plans for Work and the Advancement of Social Justice that we deserve. That is the Prophetic Vision.<br />
<br />
Christ Jesus is there, who commands us to Love, and that is Love for the Nation that saw us born, for the Nation that gives us Light, and for every Nicaraguan who, as Brothers and Sisters, with Infinite Pride in being Free, we always continue to make our way Further On, transcending and building the Future!<br />
<br />
What a Blessing to know how to transcend. What a Blessing to be able to repair and restore the Soul from so much pain and suffering inflicted by the wicked, both here and there. What a blessing to be able to say: We Overcame, We Overcome and We Will Overcome. And We Are Free. We are the People of Darío, of Sandino, we Neither Sell Out Nor Surrender, Ever! We Overcame, We are Free, We will never be Slaves Again!<br />
<br />
A Big Embrace with immense Love in these Patriotic Days of Nation and of Freedom, to all Nicaragua’s Families. Thank you, Compañeras and Compañeros. </span></p>
