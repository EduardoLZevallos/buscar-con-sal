pardon theft of over US$900 million during neo liberal governments </span><small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">By Karla Jacobs</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">February 2nd 2010</span></small>
      </big><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Last week, on January
28th, a group of seven deputies belonging to former president Arnoldo
Aleman's PLC and former presidential candidate Eduardo Montelalegre's
MVE presented a bill proposing an amnesty for </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">over
1,500
former public officials who are accused of committing </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">crimes
including
(but not exclusively) the theft of over C$18 billion (roughly
US$900 million) from the Nicaraguan State between March 1990 and
January 2007. <br>
      <br>
This proposal comes at a crucial time for all political parties given
the imminent election by the National Assembly of over 30 top posts
within different State powers and institutions (the Supreme Electoral
Council, the Supreme Court of Justice and the Comptroller General
Office among others).&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In terms of the opposition leadership's expressed objective to form a united
opposition alliance between Eduardo Montealegre and Arnoldo Aleman prior to the 2011 presidential elections - a goal
which until now has not been possible due to the profound
mistrust between those two leaders - the
proposed amnesty could turn out to be the best hope for the creation of
such an alliance since the liberal split in 2002 when former president
Enrique Bolaños' administration began the prosecution process
against Aleman. </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">No one knows the true extent of
theft of public money during the neo liberal period</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
During a recent <a href="tortilla/node/43.html">TV interview</a>
Comptroller Luis Angel Montenegro described the proposed
amnesty as a "devastating economic and moral blow for Nicaragua...
which
would effectively discard all of the hundreds of audits carried out the
CGR during a 16 year period." As well as "encouraging corruption among
public officials and society in general" the proposed amnesty would
cause significant economic damage to the public
sector given that the Attorney General has embargoes equivalent to
C$400
million based on CGR resolutions relating to fraudulent activity during
the period in question, explained Montenegro. <br>
      <br>
The CGR's official figure for the amount of money</span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
officials of three consecutive neo liberal administrations stole from
the State</span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> is C$18,097 million. That figure is
based on CGR audits and backed up with extensive documented evidence.
Montenegro admits, however, that in all likelihood the real figure is
many
times that given the CGR's lack of capacity to keep tags on
all government institutions. According to the Comptroller, the CGR's
capacity is just a third of what is should be to effectively audit all
publicly administrated funds. <br>
      <br>
On top of that, there are specific cases of further multi-million
dollar fraud - for example the theft of a significant amount of
international aid money donated to Nicaragua as part of the relief
effort following Hurricane Mitch - which are not included in that
figure. Montenegro explained that, </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">as
part
of an agreement between then President Arnoldo Aleman and
former Comptroller General Agustin Jarquin</span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">,
the
government was not required to account for international funding
donated as emergency aid for victims of the devastating hurricane.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The opposition claim they are
persecuted for political reasons - actually the opposite is true</span><br>
      <br>
The opposition parties, who claim that the hundreds of different CGR
accusations against former right wing officials form part of an FSLN
attempt to persecute members of the opposition,&nbsp; justify the
proposed amnesty saying it is necessary in order to break the grip the
governing party has over opposition leaders. <br>
      <br>
As analyst William Grigsby explained on his TV show "Sin Fronteras"
however, this is a cynical manipulation of the truth:<br>
      <br>
      </span></span>
      
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Both [Aleman and Montealegre] say that the
FSLN [uses its influence within the justice system] to blackmail them
into negotiating [with the government]. But the exact opposite is true
- they blackmail the FSLN. They say "if you take me to court I won't
give you the votes you want, for example, to elect magistrates in the
different State powers ... I won't guarantee the presence of enough
deputies for the National Assembly to function." They say "if you carry
on with this prosecution I'll denounce you as a dictator, I'll say I'm
a victim of political persecution."</span></span></span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"></span></span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's
true
that the Nicaraguan justice system has been politicized, but it
wasn't the FSLN that politicized it, it was the right wing. The right
are the
ones who say that if the justice system prosecutes them it's for
political reasons. But actually they are the ones who politicize the
justice system to ensure that, for political reasons, the tribunals
absolve them of their crimes.<br>
      <br>
      </span></span></span></div>

      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Currently the FSLN is leading a
public and diplomatic campaign to try to dissuade the ratification of
the proposed amnesty. This offensive involves a high volume media
campaign bringing attention to the gravity of the financial crimes that
would be pardoned as part of the opposition's proposal. Over the
weekend (January 30th and 31st) dozens of large signs </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">were
located
on billboards on all Managua's main streets </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">featuring
pictures
of Montealegre and Aleman above the phrase "Would you vote for
these thieves?" TV and radio spots with a similar message have begun
appearing on the main media outlets that don't respond to anti- FSLN
interests.<br>
      <br>
Also on February 1st Foreign Minister Samuel Santos, Attorney General
Hernan Estrada and senior FSLN deputies held a meeting with the foreign
diplomats in the country in order to communicate the government's
position on the opposition's amnesty bill. <br>
      <br>
While certain foreign diplomats may have responded with genuine shock
and disapproval to the information presented by the government
representatives, US Ambassador Robert Callahan, and perhaps also a
number of his European counterparts, will no doubt already have been
all too aware of what the opposition's proposal entails.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible fallouts and outcome
should amnesty be passed</span><br>
      <br>
As mentioned earlier, the opposition may well be banking on the amnesty
turning into a catalyst for the formation of a united right wing
alliance, a task that has so far proved impossible. At this point it
seems likely that Montealegre's backers at the US Embassy would be
willing to rethink their former insistence on Montealegre's leadership
of such an alliance and settle for Aleman as the natural leader of
the Nicaraguan right wing. <br>
      <br>
      </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It is unclear, however, to what
extent the right wing would be able to overcome the inevitable damage
an amnesty would do to their already dwindling level of popular
support. According
to a recent poll carried out by Nuevo Siglo Consultas all the different
right wing opposition parties put together (PLC, MVE, ALN, PLI, MRS,
PC)
barely command 1</span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">5% of the Nicaraguan population's</span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
support. A poll carried out by the same polling company on January 30th
found that only 8.8% of the Managuan population said they would be
willing to vote for a candidate who had been accused of corruption. <br>
      <br>
Of course the formation of a disciplined anti-FSLN alliance involving
the PLC, MVE and&nbsp; the smaller right wing factions would make life
difficult for the government in terms of getting its legislative agenda
through the National Assembly, something that could prevent the second
two years of Ortega's presidency running as smoothly as the first
three. <br>
      <br>
On top of that, it is unlikely the governing party
could keep up the intense anti-right wing momentum an amnesty law would
allow them to create for the next 19 months until the general elections
in November next year.<br>
      <br>
With or without a united right wing alliance,
however, there is good reason to suggest that the FSLN is headed for
victory in next year's presidential elections. As far as one is
able to predict domestic trends and events, it is hard to imagine the
right wing doing anything themselves which would permit a
sufficient recuperation of public support to allow them to overtake the
FSLN in the electoral
race. <br>
      <br>At
this point it would seem fair to suggest that, should anything come
between the FSLN and electoral victory in 2011, it will come from
outside Nicaragua. Given the current regional situation, the most
obvious obstacle in this sense would be an intensification of the
developing stand-off between the United States, with its new military
bases in Colombia and Panama, and the ALBA countries led by Venezuela
and Cuba. <br>
