malnutrition and hunger in Nicaragua: a battle on many fronts </span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">

<br>
&#8220;Hunger is a consequence of poverty, caused by diverse factors that
reduce or impede access to food, one of those factors being
insufficient income to obtain food. Hunger is also a cause of poverty
given that it affects the physical and intellectual development of
children as well as limiting people&#8217;s general capabilities and their
ability to produce or generate income for themselves and for their
country as a whole.&#8221; <br>
(<a href="http://www.onu.org.ni/files/dmilenio/1170781791_objetivo1.pdf">UN document about millennium goals in Nicaragua</a>)<br>
<br>
This week the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier de
Schutter, visited Nicaragua for the first time to evaluate the
situation with regards to food security and malnutrition in the
country. <br>
<br>
As part of his week-long visit, ending on September
13th, de Schutter has met with Agriculture Minister, Ariel Bucardo, and
other high level government representatives, the Human Rights
Ombudsman, Omar Cabezas, Supreme Court magistrates, National Assembly
deputies and representatives of civil society and other organizations
whose work involves programs to do with food security and nutrition. In
early 2010 de Schutter will report on his findings at the UN
headquarters in New York.<br>
<br>
During comments to the press, de Schutter acknowledged the FSLN
government&#8217;s legal, institutional and programmic advances towards
reducing hunger in the country emphasizing the 6% reduction in infant
malnutrition. <br>
<br>
The UN Rapporteur described the recently approved Food and Nutritional
Security and Sovereignty Law as &#8220;encouraging&#8221; and a &#8220;model&#8220; on which to
base efforts to guarantee the Nicaraguan population&#8217;s right to food. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The state of food security in Nicaragua</span><br>
<br>
Diverse government and other institutional studies confirm that the
sectors of Nicaraguan society who are most likely to suffer hunger and
malnutrition are children, women, impoverished families, people who
have had little or no access to formal education, indigenous peoples
and rural dwellers.<br>
<br>
A <a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0291s/i0291s00.pdf">UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report</a>&nbsp; published in
2008 about the state of food security in the world, found that more
than a fifth of the overall Nicaraguan population (22%) was
malnourished in 2005. While the overall percentage of under nourished
citizens fell steadily from 52% in 1990 to 22% in 2005, other
in-country studies demonstrate that food insecurity among certain
sectors of society, specifically women in child bearing age and
under-fives, did in fact increase between 2001 and 2006, as did the
number of people living in extreme poverty. <br>
<br>
The <a href="http://issuu.com/nicaragua.nutrinet.org/docs/informe_preliminar_endesa_2006-2007/50">2006-2007 National Health and Demographic Census</a>
found that the percentage of under weight newborns (an indicator of
malnutrition in both infants and mothers) grew from 2.6% to 6.4%
between 2001 and 2006. It also found that more under-fives were falling
ill with diarrea in 2006 than in 2001.<br>
<br>
According to a <a href="http://www.onu.org.ni/files/dmilenio/1170781791_objetivo1.pdf">UN report about food security in Nicaragua</a> the percentage
of the population living in extreme poverty fell by just 0.1% from 15%
to 14.9% between 2001 and 2005. Taking into account the year on year
population growth in the country for that period, this figure actually
translates into a higher number of people living in destitution in 2005
than four years earlier. <br>
<br>
The same report demonstrates the intrinsic link between higher levels
of education and food security. While 18% of under fives with mothers
who were unable to study themselves are undernourished in Nicaragua,
only 1% of under fives with mothers who have high school qualifications
are malnourished. <br>
<br>
As part of the public sector <a href="http://www.magfor.gob.ni//descargas/SeguridadAlimentaria/Politica%20SSAN%20UV%20140509.pdf">Food Security and Sovereignty Policy</a>,
published by the Ministry of Agriculture in May 2009, a number of
cultural and other factors that contribute to a high tendency towards
malnutrition among the Nicaraguan population were outlined. <br>
<br>
The average Nicaraguan&#8217;s diet tends to be unbalanced with over 65% of
calories derived from carbohydrates, something which leads to a high
possibility of poor health related to insufficient protein consumption.
On top of this the daily average per capita calorie intake in Nicaragua
is 200 calories less than recommended daily levels. Considering the
extremely unequal distribution of wealth in Nicaraguan society, we can
assume that a significant percentage of the Nicaraguan population has a
much greater calorie intake-deficit than the per capita average.<br>
<br>
The tendency for ordinary Nicaraguans not to incorporate fruit and
vegetables into their diet is a factor that contributes to the
considerable levels of vitamin deficiency registered by the Nicaraguan
health authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
High levels of consumption of processed and synthetic foods (like soft
drinks, and other processed sweets and snacks) in urban areas and
growing levels of consumption of this sort of food in rural areas are a
cause of concern for the authorities, who admit that as yet no program
to tackle this specific problem has been introduced. <br>
<br>
In terms of the extent to which the population&#8217;s organisms are able to
biologically make the most of the nutrients in their diet, the
persisting problems of lack of access to sanitation and safe drinking
water constitute a major obstacle. It is estimated that 75.3% of water
sources used by rural dwellers in Nicaragua are not safe, while over
20% of the urban population still does not have access to one of the
state water company&#8217;s water systems. Meanwhile a significant proportion
of the overall population does not have access to basic sanitation.<br>
<br>
People without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation have
a high probability of suffering from chronic bacterial stomach
infections that reduce the body&#8217;s ability to digest food properly
provoking malnutrition. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
What has the FSLN government done to increase food security?</span><br>
<br>
Since coming to power in January 2007 the FSLN government has brought
in a number of measures aimed at increasing food security and
sovereignty for the population and the nation as a whole. <br>
<br>
The measures implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG-FOR) and
other public institutions related to agricultural production include
the Zero Hunger Program which aims to ensure that 75,000 rural families
previously suffering varying levels of food insecurity are able to
produce enough food to meet their own needs over a period of five
years. <br>
<br>
During the first two years of the FSLN government 32,359 food
production packages (consisting of a pregnant cow, a pregnant sow, ten
chickens, one cockerel, seeds and other inputs) were provided to the
same number of families in rural areas of Nicaragua.<br>
<br>
The government has also successfully increased the amount of basic
grains being produced by small and medium farmers and agricultural
cooperatives since 2007 as a result of its certified seeds program.
140,010 small and medium farmers who previously did not have access to
credit to produce food were provided with zero interest in-kind loans
of certified seeds and fertilizer in 2008. <br>
<br>
Additionally MAG-FOR has overseen the implementation of the National
Seed System, an inter-institutional system involving a number of public
institutions. By November 2008, the national seed system had converted
Nicaragua into the biggest producer of certified seeds for national
production in Central America. <br>
<br>
Certified seeds are the product of extensive quality monitoring and
guarantee higher yields for farmers, reducing the need for excessive
use of pesticides and other agro-chemicals. <br>
<br>
The State company responsible for guaranteeing basic food supply,
ENABAS, which had been effectively mothballed by previous neo-liberal
administrations, has been reactivated by the Sandinista government. As
a result, the company, which has basic grain storage facilities across
the country, is able to exercise growing influence on basic grain
markets resulting in much greater stability of both the price paid to
producers and the price paid by consumers. <br>
<br>
As part of the government&#8217;s Food for the People program, 3,506 ENABAS
supervised, community run shops selling basic foods at below market
prices have been set up in neighbourhoods and communities across the
country since 2007. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Free school meals and increased medical attention for infants and
mothers</span><br>
<br>
In terms of tackling the specific problem of malnutrition in
Nicaragua&#8217;s child population, the FSLN government&#8217;s policy is based on
two main projects. <br>
<br>
Since 2007 the Ministry of Education (MINED) has guaranteed free school
meals for all primary school children, something that was never
achieved during previous administrations. The meals consist of rice,
beans, corn, oil and cereal, and are prepared by pupils&#8217; parents as
part of a school supervised rota system. <br>
<br>
The impact and reach of this program is substantially increased thanks
to the record number of children and young people who are able to
attend school since the public school system was de-privatized in 2007.
Over one million primary school pupils (more than 15% of the entire
Nicaraguan population) receive school meals as part of this program.<br>
<br>
Additionally, a new piece of legislation obliging the State to provide
resources to fund a school milk program as of next year was passed
recently. This will allow for all primary school children to receive a
glass of milk with their school meal. <br>
<br>
In 2008 the Ministry of Health (MINSA) presented its plan <a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/meeting/013/ai711s.pdf">&#8220;Towards the
Eradication of Chronic Malnutrition in Infants&#8221;</a> which aims to
halve the percentage of children under three suffering from chronic
malnutrition by 2015 in line with the UN Millennium Goals. <br>
<br>
This plan, which is aimed at children under three and pregnant and
breastfeeding women, involves the progressive implementation of a
number of public health system supervised measures to reduce
nutritional deficiencies in the most vulnerable sectors of
society.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
As part of the plan MINSA has identified the regions where children are
most likely to suffer from malnutrition. 88 municipalities, home to 57%
of the population, were identified as areas with high, very high or
extreme nutritional vulnerability. In the ten municipalities with the
highest levels of malnutrition, over 50% of children were
undernourished. These municipalities account for the most remote areas
of the country where there is least access to healthcare and other
basic services. <br>
<br>
Among the measures to be implemented in the 88 prioritized
municipalities are universal provision of iron and folic acid to women
of child-bearing age, universal provision of vitamin A and iron
supplements for children between 6 months and five years, treatment of
diarrea with zinc and rehydration salts, universal vaccines against
rotavirus, programs to promote and support the practice of exclusive
breastfeeding until six months of age and the provision of family
planning advice with the option of contraception methods for all women
in child-bearing age. <br>
<br>
This plan, currently in its second year, is being implemented with the
supervision of MINSA&#8217;s Food and Nutritional Security Technical
Commission. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Food Security and Sovereignty Law </span><br>
<br>
In June the National Assembly approved the <a href="http://www.pesacentroamerica.org/biblioteca/SSANN.pdf">Law of Food and Nutritional
Security and Sovereignty</a>, which
recognizes the right to nutritious and safe food as a fundamental human
right. Surprising as it may seem, Nicaragua is among only a handful of
countries in the world to actually recognize the right to food as a
basic human right.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This law sets out the institutional framework of the National System of
Food and Nutritional Security and Sovereignty involving local,
departmental, regional and central government, relevant public
ministries and institutions, NGOs and other national and international
organizations working on food security issues and other relevant
institutions and organizations. <br>
<br>
This system, presided by the President of the Republic, is responsible
for designing, facilitating and implementing measures to directly
increase national food security and sovereignty in the short, medium
and long term. It is also responsible for articulating all the
different food security initiatives carried out by different groups in
the country as a way of ensuring maximum impact.<br>
<br>
The law obliges the State to provide funding for food security and
sovereignty programs and establishes the creation of a Food Security
Emergency Fund to respond to situations of extreme food insecurity
resulting from natural disasters and social or economic crises. <br>
<br>
Also as a result of the law, Nicaragua will appoint a Right to Food
Ombudsman to monitor and report on the evolving situation regarding the
right to food in the country. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
FAO representative praises government&#8217;s efforts to increase food
security</span><br>
<br>
Obviously the impact of the government&#8217;s multipronged approach to
tackling the problems of hunger and malnutrition is not something that
can be measured in the short term. FAO&#8217;s in-country representative,
Gero Vaagt, is confident, however, that the government&#8217;s efforts are
making a difference to those Nicaraguans who are most vulnerable to the
effects of long-term economic exclusion and the ongoing global food
crisis.<br>
<br>
During the inauguration of the 2009-2010 agricultural cycle, an event
that took place in the southern region of Nueva Guinea, <a href="http://www.conamornicaragua.org.ni/DOCUMENTOS%202009/MAYO/NICARAGUA%20PAIS%20MODELO%20EN%20SEGURIDAD%20ALIMENTARIA%20Inauguracion%20Ciclo%20Agricola%202009%20en%20Nueva%20Guinea%20160509.doc">Vaagt announced
</a>that the Nicaraguan food security program had been identified as one of
the two most successful such programs monitored by the international
organization: <br>
<br>
&#8220;I want to applaud the Nicaraguan government for its efforts in the
area of food security. FAO, as an international, intergovernmental
organization, has classified these efforts and Nicaragua as a model
country, an exemplary country in terms of confronting issues relating
to food security, reducing hunger and improving the nutritional
situation of the population. &#8230;<br>
<br>
The Special Food Security Program in Nicaragua, PESA, was identified as
one of the two most successful of the 62 food security programs that
FAO is involved with around the world. &#8230; <br>
<br>
The main reasons for this are the fact that the issue of food and
nutritional security has been defined as a priority by the Nicaraguan
government, but not just for the agricultural sector, also for the
education and health systems. In Nicaragua the Ministries of
Agriculture, Health and Education have been working together on food
security programs. It is as a result of this approach, of the
collaboration between these three sectors, that the creation of the
Food and Nutritional Security and Sovereignty Law was possible."<br>
