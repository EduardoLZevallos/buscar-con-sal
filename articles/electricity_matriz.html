are many factors that lead one to wonder what would have become of
Nicaragua if one of the right wing candidates had won the presidential
elections in 2006. Most prominent among these factors are the Nicaraguan right wing opposition's lack of realistic policy
proposals concerning the most pressing national issues and their
more than evident inability to improve living conditions&nbsp;for the
majority of the population. Surely one of the most critical issues that the
national right wing, in its various party political manifestions, failed
to address was the virtual collapse of the country's electrical energy
sector. (During the last year of Enrique Bolaños' government, the
entire country was subjected to daily
power cuts lasting between four and fourteen hours.)<br><br>The
three neo-liberal administrations that preceded the current FSLN
government were characterized by the implementation of
policies based on&nbsp;systematic cuts in public spending,
privatization of public services and submissive acceptance
of&nbsp;unacceptable abuses by big business. Ordinary Nicaraguans
suffered the&nbsp;progressively damaging effects this form of economic
laissez-faire had on their basic human rights for 16 long years. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collapsed energy sector</span><br><br>The
multipronged social and economic crisis created as a result of the
unquestioning implementation of neo-liberal economic policy was part of
most Nicaraguans' daily experience long before members of
the minority elitist classes began to suffer the disruption of daily
power cuts. Banks,
multinational chain stores and the richest of the rich were able to protect themselves from the
crisis to a certain
extent as the purchase of diesel run generators and fuel did
not make too much of a dent on their profit margins or fortunes. Unable
to absorb
similar dents, however, tens of thousands of small and medium business
owners went under. The school year was disrupted for tens of thousands of
students.The lives of patients in Intensive care&nbsp;were put at risk in
hospitals that could not afford to maintain a generator. It was
impossible
for the National Police to guarantee citizen security after dark. And
yet the&nbsp;government did next to nothing.<br><br>In August 2006, after a
relatively dry wet season, <a href="http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2006/08/19/nacionales/26919">Bolaños warned that the only hope</a>
for a
reduction in the country's growing energy deficit would be above
average rainfall in September and October so that Nicaragua's biggest
hydroelectrical plant, located in Lake Apanás, was able to operate at
full capacity. If the below average rainfall continued, he said, the
energy crisis "could get worse in the dry season."&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lack of investment and progressive privatization </span><br><br>At
the time representatives of the
Bolaños administration spoke a lot about the problem of the increasing
oil price. There is a lot more to the Nicaraguan energy crisis
than that, though. The neo liberal governments' most significant failure in
terms of ensuring the nation's energy security was the lack of
investment in new energy generation plants and maintenance for
existing generation plants. <br><br>Between
1996 and 2006&nbsp;only 142 additional megawatts (MW) were made available to the national grid. Over half of the "new"
energy created during this ten year period is produced in conventional
fossil fuel combustion generating plants exacerbating further the
country's irrational dependence on oil for electrical generation.
Nicaragua has the potential to produce over ten times the
current&nbsp;national demand from renewable sources (see
table below). Despite this, the country currently depends on imported oil
derivatives to generate roughly 75% of its electricity.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicaragua's potential and effective renewable energy generation</span></small><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 617px; height: 183px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><small>&nbsp;Type of Generation</small></td><td><small>Potential (MW)</small></td><td><small>Effective <br>Capacity (MW)</small></td><td><small>%&nbsp;of potential capacity <br>currently being made use of</small></td></tr><tr><td><small>Hydroelectric</small></td><td><small>3,280</small></td><td><small>98</small></td><td><small>3</small></td></tr><tr><td><small>Geothermic</small></td><td><small>1,200</small></td><td><small>37</small></td><td><small>3.1</small></td></tr><tr><td><small>Wind power</small></td><td><small>800</small></td><td><small>0</small></td><td><small>0</small></td></tr><tr><td><small>Biomass</small></td><td><small>200</small></td><td><small>60</small></td><td><small>30</small></td></tr><tr><td><small>Total</small></td><td><small>5,480</small></td><td><small>195</small></td><td><small>3.6</small></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><small>taken from the Ministry of Energy and Mines' <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/www.hacienda.gob.ni/hacienda/gap2007/PresentacionENERGIA.pdf">Strategic Plan for the Energy Sector</a> </small></span></div><br>Insufficient
efforts to promote investment in Nicaragua's enormous potential for
renewable energy meant that the country was doomed to suffer severe
energy insecurity when in 2005 the international oil price began to
rise. During 2006&nbsp;Nicaragua paid out 65% of the value of its
exports to import oil and other petroleum derivatives. <br><br>As
well as a lack of investment, a progressive process of privatization
was imposed on the National Electricity Company (ENEL) between 1990 and
2006 with the sale of numerous generation plants to national and
international "investors." Meanwhile some of the more important
generation plants still under possession of ENEL, which was by now severely
undermined, such as the Managua
Plant (57.4 MW) and the Las Brisas&nbsp; Plant (81 MW), were subjected
to such extreme underfunding that they experienced frequent technical
failures. <br><br>It seems fair to suggest that, as was the case with
the National Water Company (ENACAL), the neo-liberal governments' plan
was to provoke an unprecedented crisis within ENEL as a pretext to justify the complete
privatization of the company. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Union Fenosa's credit anomalies</span><br><br>Other factors which create
energy insecurity in Nicaragua include the fact that roughly 30%
of all electricity generated in Nicaragua is lost due to technical
faults in the national grid and energy fraud (energy "stolen" by
electricity consumers who have illegal connections to the
grid). This situation is exacerbated by the failure of Union Fenosa (the Spanish
company that distributes electricity in Nicaragua) to invest in
maintenance, repairs or expansion of the national grid. <br><br>Despite
the company's failure to comply with the investment commitments
outlined in its contract (investments which were designed to reduce
this type of losses and expand the national grid) Union Fenosa has
consistently claimed to be making multi-million losses in Nicaragua
(while sending healthy profits back to its share holders in Spain). During
2005 and 2006 Fenosa regularly refused to pay generating companies for
electricity provided, thus provoking a lack of liquidity within the energy
generating sector. <br><br> The lack of investment in new generation plant together with frequent
and serious technical faults in existing generation plant and a lack of liquidity within the sector meant that
by the end of 2006 the country was suffering a permanent energy deficit
of nearly 100 MW. (At that time&nbsp;the average national electricity demand
was 485 MW.) Bolaños' government declared itself incapable of doing anything to resolve the crisis. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FSLN government creates Energy Ministry </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>One
of the first things the FSLN government did once it assumed power in
January 2007 was to create the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) to
oversee the energy sector. This was the first move in what has become
the increasingly successful process of State empowerment within the energy
sector.<br><br>By
mid-2008 an extra 120 megawatts were being generated in Nicaragua with
the installation of diesel based generating plants operated by ENEL.
Most of these plants were made available under long term low interest
rate credit agreements as part of a cooperation agreement with
Venezuela. One of
the plants was donated by Taiwan. <br><br>A further 60 megawatts
will be made available with the installation of another diesel based
generation plant during 2009 to complete the government's plan of short
term measures to confront the energy crisis. As a result of these
measures the daily power cuts, or "electricity rationing," came to an
end in December 2007. This was possible despite the soaring
international oil price thanks to Venezuelan solidarity in the
provision of preferential payment conditions on fuel. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Long term plan to transform generation infrastructural framework</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>Simultaneously, the Energy Ministry has been working
towards the long term aim of transforming the infrastructural framework
of energy generation in Nicaragua so that by 2014 eighty percent of
the electricity produced in the country will come from renewable
sources. As part of this plan private and mixed international and
national companies have been given contracts to develop six different
geothermal generating plants, five hydro-electric plants, three wind
power plants and one biomass plant to generate a total of 597 MW by
2014. Many of these projects are&nbsp;already&nbsp;advancing towards
the final stages, with Nicaragua's first wind powered electricity
generation plant scheduled to start operating in early January&nbsp;2009.
&nbsp; <br><br>As part of its strategic plan to overcome the energy crisis
the FSLN government has signed cooperation agreements with countries
and multilateral organizations as diverse as Iran, Taiwan, Canada,
Iceland, Russia, Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, members of&nbsp;the European
Union and the Central American Economic Integration Bank making a
mockery of the government's political opponents' claim that the Ortega
Administration is isolating Nicaragua from the international community.
&nbsp; <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What to do about Fenosa?</span><br><br>In
an attempt to overcome the lack of liquidity (due to
credit problems for the generating companies caused by Union Fenosa
late or non-existent payment for power generated) the government
arranged
for&nbsp;credit with flexible payment conditions to be provided&nbsp;to
Union Fenosa and to electrical generating companies during 2007 and
2008. This credit is provided by the financial cooperative ALBA-Caruna
that administers funds made available as part of&nbsp;Venezuelan
cooperation with Nicaragua.<br><br>During the second half of 2008 the government negotiated an agreement with Union Fenosa whereby in
exchange for a US$10 million&nbsp;debt the company owed to state
institutions, the government would receive&nbsp;16% of the company's shares
in Nicaragua and be given one seat on the in-country Board of
Directors.&nbsp; <br><br>While
the most desirable option would be to
send the disgraced multinational packing, the government knows it would
most likely be liable to pay a multi-million dollar fine for cancelling
the 30 year contract Union Fenosa was given during President Arnoldo
Aleman's
administration.&nbsp;The World Bank agency that oversees the
development of
such contracts (rich country multinationals taking over public sector
service utilities in impoverished countries), the Multilateral
Investment
Guarantee Agency, has a track record of successfully pushing for
verdicts favourable
to multinationals in such disputes. This means that despite
Fenosa's repeated breaches of&nbsp;contract, the possibility of a
multi-million dollar compensation
demand must be a real concern for the Nicaraguan government. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Increase coverage and per capita consumption</span><br><br>Other aspects of the government's <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/www.hacienda.gob.ni/hacienda/gap2007/PresentacionENERGIA.pdf">Strategic Plan for the Energy Sector</a>
include the expansion of access to electrical energy in rural areas
(currently just over 50% of Nicaraguan homes have electricity). In this
vein ENEL is carrying out and overseeing the construction
of numerous small scale energy generation plants (mainly hydroelectric)
to provide electricity to remote rural communities. The energy produced
by these small scale plants will not pass through the national grid. <br><br>The
government also wants to increase per capita consumption of
electricity. Currently Nicaragua has the lowest rate of per capita
electricity consumption in the continent after Haiti.&nbsp; <br><br>In
terms of electrical energy, Nicaragua's problems are both numerous and
complex. Whereas previous governments preferred to&nbsp;leave
everything
to the "free" market, the FSLN government has proved itself willing and
able to take on those problems. By increasing State control over the
energy sector and broadening cooperation relations
with the wider international community, the government has taken bold
steps
towards turning the country's energy crisis into
an opportunity to modernise the generating sytem, which, ironically,
sounds a bit like all the neo-liberal, free market rhetoric Nicaraguans
got so used to hearing after
1990.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Karla based her research for this article on the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.mem.gob.ni/">Ministry of Energy and Mines' website</a><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.enel.gob.ni/">ENEL's website</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> and publicly available Nicaraguan and international news sources. </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br></td></tr><tr style="font-family: sans-serif;"><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
