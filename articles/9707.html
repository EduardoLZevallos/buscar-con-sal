<p><b>WHAT </b><b> IS OUR WATCHWORD?</b><br />
<b>THE PEOPLE CANNOT BE STOPPED!</b><br />
<br />
<b>WHAT </b><b> IS OUR WATCHWORD?</b><br />
<b>FSLN, FSLN, FSLN, FSLN, FSLN, FSLN...!</b><br />
<br />
Dear Compañer@s :<br />
<br />
<b>Onward, ever onward, we advance in Blessings, Prosperity and Victories, of Peace and Love...! Forward, we go, Comrades, advancing in the Revolution... Our People are the Owners of their History, Architect of their Liberation...!</b><br />
<br />
Onward, ever onward, with Love and Hope Assured we go, making the path we take, <b>Travelers</b><b>, there is no Path... we make the Path as we go... </b>And every day, from the moment God dawns, we make the Path we take, knowing that when we look back, we see a Path we may never take again.<br />
<br />
<b>Travelers, there is no Path, we make the Path as we go...!</b> And so we do go, with determined effort, with greater Conscience, with ever higher Commitment to New Victories, because already we are creating them with Good and Vibrant, Vigorous Heart, always in the Indomitable, Strong, Worthy Spirit of Sandino, our General of Free Men and Women, of Carlos, of Tomás, of all our Heroic Heritage, of Daniel, of all those Great Nicaraguans, Men and Women, Heroes, Martyrs, who have given their lives <b>OUT OF LOVE FOR NICARAGUA</b><br />
<br />
<b>With Daniel our leader, the People-President...!</b> A People that prioritizes and privileges Peace based on Sovereignty and National Dignity. A People defending the Right to Live and Work in Peace, in Harmonious Coexistence, in assured Security, in loving, active Solidarity, in the decisive Protagonism of Families, of Women, Men, of all ages, and of Youth always ready with Commitment.<br />
<br />
A People that painstakingly defends <b>the Right of All for the Good of All</b>, and to Work, to the Prosperity that we deserve as Human Beings, children of God, our right to the Gift of Happiness and Joy...  Our Duty is to Sing out in happiness, accepting all the Battles, and making our way through all our Victories.<br />
<br />
<b>THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES...</b><br />
<b>VICTORY IS CERTAIN...!</b><br />
<br />
<b>No one here has ever surrendered!</b> Here the ones who surrendered were never with us, the ones who gave up, who sold out, the ones who today must feel ashamed to see themselves in the mirror of history, in the words of our Comandante Tomás,<b> "the traitors and cowards who are already footnotes in a bygone story..."</b><br />
<br />
<b>No one here surrenders...!</b> Here there are Sacred Fire, Flames and Fiery Beacons of Love out of which we believe and create with Heroism this Present of unprecedented Commitment, new and formidable Patrimonies of the Nicaraguan Soul, Sandinista, Revolutionary and Evolutionary, of a People that Overcomes, because we do Overcome, and we will Overcome !<br />
<br />
<b>No one here surrenders...!</b> The ones bent over,  with their backs bowed, the ones on their knees, the ones who failed, are others, who survive as the ghosts of themselves, as shadows of themselves, with all the sorrow and none of the glory, revealing themselves without the masks they once used, but who only fooled themselves.<br />
<br />
<b>No one here surrenders...! </b>With Leonel Rugama, with Fernando Gordillo, with Ricardo Morales Avilés, with the courage of Diriangén, of Andrés Castro, of General Benjamín Zeledón, of Sandino and the Army In Defence of National Sovereignty, of all the thousands of peasants, workers and humble families, who were, and are, the Foundation and Origin of the Sandinista Struggle drawing from the Memory and Collective Consciousness of our People, and of this <b>Sandinista National Liberation Front</b>.<br />
<br />
At all times and in these recent decades with Daniel, we have known how to confront with courage and nobility, with firmness, with unity, the multiple imperialist attempts to destroy our Christian and Solidarity inspired Society, our Christian and Solidarity inspired Nicaragua, which disturbs them so much through its example of kindness, of generosity, of the rights and social justice which constitute our model, founded on the principles and values of yesterday, today, and the future that we can see ahead of us, from the Hand of God.<br />
<br />
<b>Our song is of the Values of those who dream. </b><b><b>Hope prevails o</b>n their bare, strong, capable shoulders...!</b><br />
<br />
<b>Forty-one years after a triumph that surprised the world; forty-one years after an immense victory</b> that put an end to crime, to genocide, to the hatred and perversion that ruled Nicaragua, subjugated by the Empire, an end to the intervention, occupation and imperial commands that shamed us all.<br />
<br />
<b>At 41 years of age, Nicaragua today stands always Bright, always full of Life and Hope</b>, as Rubén sang, always full of Heaven, of Blue Skies and of the Whiteness of Peace and of so much Good and Pious Heart that we Women and Men have, and our Youth, Divine Treasure, in this our Homeland, Always Blessed and Always Free... Nicaragua, Sacred Land of an intense Dawn...! <b>Nicaragua Free y Full of Light</b>, said Tomás, and so we sing, <b>"Carlos with his short-sighted, intense blue eyes</b>", here we are, grateful to God for so much Life and for that immense, glorious Nicaraguan Spirit!<br />
<br />
<b>Forty-one years after that memorable, unforgettable, that Happy Day of Long-Dreamed-of Freedom</b>, of inspired Heroes and Martyrs who gave Strength to this Vigorous People, the People of Rubén and Sandino, so as to make it possible... That same Heroism manifests itself as <b>a daily never setting Sun</b>, making us more and better able to work, to advance demanding Respect for Peace, for our Families, for the permanent Processes of Reconciliation and Democracy we proudly defend, because they are essential to our Struggles of Yesterday, and because now the Triumph of July 19, 1979 remains the Triumph of Freedom, Dignity, Fraternity and Democracy that we only then knew and could live fully, for the first time in our History.<br />
<br />
Democracy is an achievement of the Nicaraguan people. Democracy is a Conquest of the Nicaraguan People. Democracy is an inviolable heritage of the Nicaraguan people. We have a right to our Democracy. We have the right to demand respect for our democracy and we have the right to exercise it as decisive protagonists in our daily life, in the economy, in the social sphere, in the family, in the community, and in the various electoral processes which now, finally are clean, orderly, fair and transparent, as they have been since 1979.<br />
<br />
Democracy is one more proud victory of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, of the Brave and Dignified People of Nicaragua, and of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which together with our People achieved the Triumph of July 19, safeguarding and protecting, in all its forms, that precious Democracy which has returned to the People their Power, their Protagonism and their Leadership in all the expressions of our Society.<br />
<br />
We are 41 so let's go on, because here we are, so then let's go on ! These Paths of Victory interrupted only by the shameful surrender of some few. On the one hand, the usual traitors, the usual oligarchs, the usual mercenaries, the usual quislings, the usual servile sellouts, and with them too, a few pitiful adopted sons and daughters who, like Judas, sold out for a few or many coins of dubious or real material value, They sold their Soul to the devil, and today they still don't know the real dimensions of the outrages they committed, of their crimes, for which they are paying with the shameful erasure of where they came from, perhaps the worst self-inflicted humiliation for people who once claimed to be something better.<br />
<br />
<b>At 41 years of age, we are already marching united towards the Sun of Victories</b><b>, </b>taking infinite trajectories of a Freedom that has never known cowardice nor does it now. <b>Fatherland and Liberty</b> said Sandino... And he says and, says it to us, <b>Always Farther</b>...<br />
<br />
Brother, give me your hand... Because united we stand. Brother from the Mountains, Brother of the Cities, together and united we fight, we overcome, and overcome we will!<br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS OUR WATCHWORD?</b><br />
<b>THE PEOPLE CANNOT BE STOPPED!</b><br />
<br />
<b>WHAT IS OUR WATCHWORD?</b><br />
<b>FSLN, FSLN, FSLN, FSLN, FSLN, FSLN...!</b><br />
<br />
<b>At 41 years old we swore to defend our Victories and conquer New Victories, </b>with Faith, Love and Harmonious Coexistence among Nicaraguans.<br />
<br />
<b>At 41 years of age we swore to walk all necessary paths for the well-being, happiness  and a  dignified and safe</b> life of all Nicaraguan families.<br />
<br />
<b>At 41 years old we swore to defend our Liberties in Brother-and-Sisterly  Consciousness,  in Solidarity and the Growing</b> <b>Protagonism</b> of our valuable Democracy.<br />
<br />
<b>In 41 Years of Triumph</b>, after so much time of indispensable struggles that have taken us through different moments but with a single character, firm, combative, irreducible, freedom loving, incorruptible and fierce, recognizing that July 19th made us Free, and so, <b>we will never again be slaves, or a colony of anyone!</b><br />
<br />
<b><strong>NICARAGUA WILL CONTINUE TO BE FREE</strong></b><br />
<b>BECAUSE SHE HAS DAUGHTERS AND SONS WHO LOVE HER!</b><br />
<br />
<b>At 41 years of age, with Daniel leading, with the People-President leading</b>, and with our hearts full of gigantic Love, we are the Giant who woke up and who will never sleep or hibernate again, because we know the World belongs to those who fight, and above all to those who know how to fight always, because they know no other Song, no other Rhythm, no other Symphony than the Sublime Decision to confont Challenges, all Challenges with Courage, Dedication and Commitment.<br />
<br />
We are Hope ! The steps we take are of a People of Faith and God. We are the Heartbeat of many made into one who truly knows the Power of Love ! We are Sandinistas ! How proudly we shout: We are Nicaraguans and Sandinistas, by the Grace of God! We are Warriors of Light. We are the the sound of bells ringing continuously calling for Peace, Understanding, Love, and for holding together an Exemplary Country, an inspiring Country because we are an Exemplary People, one full of inspiration who knows how to give inspiration.<br />
<br />
In these unprecedented times of so many challenges, our own challenge is to do our very best in everything we undertake, and to achieve ever more Stability and better Governance, and in our days and hours to thank God, because He gives us Decision, Determination, the necessary Energies to treat every Mission as Christian, Revolutionary, Solidarity inspired and Evolutionary Orders that we make into our Map to show us the Ways and Routes to follow to strengthen our <b>Culture of Peace and Goodness</b> and our Commitment with Jesus Christ, of Respect for the Dignity of All, to the Rights of All and to the Good of All.<br />
<br />
<b>Forty-one years after that historic day</b><b>, we continue to make history </b>with love in our homes, our families and our communities, and with the teachings and lessons of the great love that Jesus Christ has converted and continues to convert into daily miracles for the good and people full of charity who, with good faith, cultivate and work for better days today and for the tomorrow that we want to be <b>full of light, life and truth</b>, full of resolute and indispensable harmony among us all, for the good of all.<br />
<br />
We will project in all possible ways today, in these difficult circumstances, emphasizing health and life, the victorious commemoration of our 41 years of revolutionary democracy. We will put up flags and symbols, and creatively carry out all possible activities, with the responsible care that we all must take.<br />
<br />
We will ensure all the virtual events, contests, competitions, conferences, congresses, concerts, everything that reflects the victorious spirit of our people, in these days of celebration of heroic life, of yesterday and today, creating new victories of peace and love. We visit the families of Heroes and Martyrs, where possible, to invoke together those miracles of courage that made possible the triumph of July 19.<br />
<br />
Each one of us in each Space of Revolutionary Work we propose and carry out, taking care of ourselves and taking on responsibilities, with our best efforts, with our creativity and our innovative imagination, Activities that reflect the Vitality and the Pride of our Great People, that advances, that is already advancing, and knows, along with Dario and Sandino, how to Fight, to Make its Way and to Keep on Winning.<br />
<br />
<b>At 41 Years Old, Let's Advance to More Victories !</b><br />
<br />
<b>41/19 </b><b><b>THE PEOPLE CANNOT BE STOPPED!</b><br />
<br />
41/19 ALWAYS FARTHER !<br />
<br />
WE ARE WINNING ! WE WILL GO ON WINNING !<br />
<br />
