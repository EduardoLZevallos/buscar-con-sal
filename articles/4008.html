<h3><strong><span style="line-height:100%">Here No One Surrenders!</span></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><span style="line-height:100%">Long live Peace!</span></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><span style="line-height:100%">Remarks by Compañera Rosario Murillo</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">It’s six years ago now that they began the siege, the intimidation, with bells not calling for celebration but rather to promote Death, Murder, Torture, Barbarism, Pain... How can we forget it...! Their bells called people to kill... Bells having nothing Christian to them nor any Religious Creed... Bells that rather called to reproduce the scene of Somoza’s bombings, in the last days before his fall... Bells of decadence then, with their vampire-like calls for blood, and with the viciousness of those hiding poison in their manipulation of Biblical Messages, and too with all the stupidity of their own cowardice... Bells rung with the aim of instilling fear, to suborn out of fear, to repress out of fear; seeking to wipe out the Bravery and Gallantry of Nicaragua’s People, who know about Struggle, who know about Honor... The Loving and Always Victorious People of Nicaragua.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Six years ago they bared their talons, their claws, they took off their masks, they thought they could prevail, but this People of Darío, of Zeledón, of Sandino, of Carlos, of Tomás, of Daniel, of our Blue and White and Red and Black Flags, those Flags are of the Nicaraguan People, not of the quisling Sell Outs... Once again this People taught them the Lesson, the Lesson that Andrés gave with his Stone, Zeledón with his Honor, Sandino with his Brilliance, his Brilliant Vision as the General of Free Men and Women... The Lesson that the Sandinista National Liberation Front gave them and is giving them... The Lesson that we continue to give to each and every one of those people bereft of a Nation, because those who sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Six years ago now, and the twisted, wicked disciples of Satan, the battered, the evil, the false, abandoned masquerading as good people, gave up the hypocritical smiles with which they had sought to deceive everyone, but as Sandino says: Over time time you end up fooling no one.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Six years ago now, Somocismo was reborn with its false images of grandeur, with its horror, embellished with colonial emblems, imperialist emblems, and with the convoluted words and messages of its sponsors and its media orchestra.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">They tried to overwhelm us, they tried to crush us, and of course we gave them their Lesson, like Sandino... And they left, and are still leaving, the many, wretched, dessicated dregs whose echo sounds out there somewhere... They Couldn't Prevail, Nor Will They, because the Giant People of Augusto Sandino told them: Murderers...! You Will Not Pass!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Six years ago now when the Light overcame the Darkness, and we put out their flames with Blood and Fire... Sacred Blood! Nicaragua, which represents Dignity in the Highest, this Dignity that has generated so much Sacred Blood, to bless and and mark the commitment of everyone. And we lived though the flagrant violation of all our Rights, at the hands of barbaric torturers who filled the Networks, the so-called Social Networks, with false messages, fictitious scenarios, manipulation, facades, charades of rebellion...</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Those torturers who made such play and excess, proud of torturing lives, of gouging out eyes, of making criminal mockery of Compañeras and Compañeros, of Nicaragua’s innocent Families, burning houses, kidnapping Women, Children... Those who created these fictitious scenarios of rebellion, when what they really wanted was to make us return to a subjugated Nicaragua, which of course you will never see... a submissive Nicaragua , Never, because we are Worthy and Proud Patriots... Proud children of this Blessed Nation For Ever Free!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">They invented false scenarios, usurped the true Messages of Liberation; they manipulated all our Patriotic Watchwords and Symbols... Scoundrels! Scorpions! Vermin! They, traitors and cowards, miserable Sellouts, wanted to dirty our Flags... They stole or wanted to steal our Symbols and our Songs of Struggle, that Struggle which Never Retreats... They stole, saying they were singing, when in fact what were they doing? Killing! They used as the musical background to their crimes the Songs of Real Struggle and of No Surrender.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">And Blessed Nicaragua, Sandinista, Revolutionary and Evolutionary, truly Free Nicaragua, that Nicaragua filled with Blood and Pain, that Nicaragua stood up and with a Giant's Voice shouted: Onward... Come, Comandante, you know we're going to win,... Come, Militants, you know we will overcome. And we did overcome, and we defeated them once more... once again Daniel, the Frente and the People-President defeated them. We sent them  on their way, because the history of a Free Nation cannot be dirtied, much less the Nation’s Glory. On the contrary, such garbage that belongs on the dung heap of Memory. Utter garbage!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Peace must not be trifled with... Peace must not be trifled with... Peace must not be trifled with... And there where they are, where no one pays them heed, where they live as beggars, longing for these Blessed Lands that do not belong to them... Wherever they continue or try to continue playing at their media war... There where they are nobody, insignificant dregs of Spiritual Disease... There comes to them the Glorious Sound of the Roar of the Battle, of Light, Life and Truth, of Full Justice; the Fight against Poverty, the Fight for the Common Good, the Fight in True Brotherhood, the Fight in Defense of Life, of Joy, the Fight in Honor and Patriotism, the Proud Fight of a People making its way, building, a People of Love, pulsating, praying to Jesus Christ, speaking in Spanish, telling them, sincerely, from a Glorious History: Here, No One Surrenders!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Those screams that the insolent and cowardly criminals used to shriek, usurping the Glorious Messages of Our Struggles... Because Really Here No One Surrenders... All those Messages, all those Symbols, are ours, of the hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans who have given their lives, so that we can live in Peace, with Dignity, with Tranquility, with Security, and with a Future.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Here No One Surrenders, and that's the Truth, We Don't Sell Out, We Don't Give Up! And none of our Symbols can be falsified or manipulated by frauds, phonies, fiction promoters, wanting to bend us, but They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Here, No One Surrenders... We have proved it and we continue to prove it... We are fighting poverty... We are fighting for the Peace and the Life We All Deserve... We fight for joy... We are fighting to be absolutely consistent with our Heroic Story of Nation and Freedom, of a Free Nation, and of Sovereignty written in large letters, not with ink but with Blood... And we have told them: Outside, Outside, and Outside you are, and there you can say what they want. But if you are in Tierra Nica, respect our Flags.You people bereft of a Nation too, respect our Flags, they are not yours. Because you don't know their Value or their Honor, disgraced and shameless as you are!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Sovereignty in our land... Sovereignty as the Norm and Model of Life... Decency, Intelligence, Coherence, Sensitivity, Continuity of Warriors of Love, Everyone, in this Blessed Homeland, in infinite Recognition and Appreciation of Peace, Security, Stability and Well-being, which is the unalterable Purpose and Mission of this Project of Unity, Reconciliation and National Prosperity.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Nicaragua belongs to Nicaraguans!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Nicaragua has children who love her!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Our Cause Lives, because it is the Cause of Justice, it is the Cause of Love!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Our Cause Lives, and Goes On...!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Nicaragua Remains Free!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Sandino Lives on</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">And the Struggle Continues</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">And our Victories are certain!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">We are under the Sun of Dignity and Freedom, the Sun that illuminates us, and does not set!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">We Are Free...! Our Nicaragua is neither mendacious, nor makes false pretences. We are not made for lies. We are not made for betrayal. We are not made for vice. We are not made for submission... We serve no Foreign Owner!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Nicaragua is for Glory and Victory, and We Go Forward, Always Further On, with Sandino, with Zeledón, with Andrés, with Carlos, with Tomás, with Daniel, with this Heroic People that has given up so many Children defending Life, defending Peace and the Values of National Pride, Sovereignty, Dignity and Decorum. That's what we have inherited, that's what we are, that's how we make our way, that's what we defend.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">By Love and with Love, Let's Go Onward!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Get behind us all betrayers, mercenaries and dealers in Evil!</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:100%">Victories belong to the Good, they are of the People, they are of the Honor of being Nicaraguans, by the Grace of God!</span></p>
