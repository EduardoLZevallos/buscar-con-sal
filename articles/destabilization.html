the brink of a downward spiral</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">by Karla Jacobs , August 13th 2008</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Except for a couple of US multinational companies which ended their
operations in the Nicaraguan Free Trade Zones earlier this year after a
modest increase in the minimum wage, US and other international capital
has not fled the country since Sandinista (FSLN) leader Daniel Ortega's
return to power in January 2007, as the most conservative factions in
the US and Nicaragua predicted.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) programs, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation fund and US government programs with
the Nicaraguan Army and National Police continue as normal. So does
trade between the US and Nicaragua. The most outspoken right-wing
critics had deemed all that impossible after Daniel Ortega's electoral
victory. They characterized him as a Marxist fanatic. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Just last week, on July 31st, the US Embassy in Managua announced
the US government's decision to approve for another year aid programs
it sponsors in Nicaragua along with ongoing support for Nicaragua's
applications for loans from international financial institutions. The
decision followed the Nicaraguan government's success in satisfying US
concerns relating to compensation claims by US citizens over property
and land confiscated during the 1980s. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
US aid to countries like Nicaragua which have undergone revolutionary
land reform processes is often conditioned on such compensation. In
order to ensure the continuing good relations with the US, Daniel
Ortega's government has paid out US$183 million to US citizens in
compensation during the last 18 months. <small>(1) </small>Many of the US citizens who
have received or who continue to claim compensation from the Nicaraguan
government are wealthy Nicaraguans who fled to Miami where they were
awarded US citizenship during the 1980s. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
But beyond that US seal of approval for another year of bilateral
cooperation and beyond the apparent normality of bilateral commercial
relations, there are signs suggesting that US-Nicaraguan relations
could be on the brink of spiraling tension.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">
The "anti-democratic Ortega" argument</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
On July 29th,&nbsp; outgoing US Ambassador Paul Trivelli reiterated
his "concerns" about what he calls "the closing of democratic spaces"
during President Daniel Ortega's administration.<small>(2)</small> Specifically,
Trivelli cited as proof of his claim the removal of former deputy
Alejandro Bolaños's right to his seat in the National Assembly, the
postponement of the local elections in the Northern Atlantic Autonomous
Region (RAAN), and the recent cancellation of the legal status of two
small parties. It is a claim repeated constantly by the national and
international corporate media and by national and international
opponents to the Ortega administration. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
On closer examination, however, Trivelli's arguments are easily disproved.
Deputy Alejandro Bolaños lost his seat after it was revealed that he
held double nationality (Nicaraguan and Canadian) which, according to
Nicaraguan law, means he is prohibited from holding public office. The
elections in the RAAN were postponed, at the request of the local
authorities, due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Felix in
September last year which displaced over 70% of the population and
destroyed the electoral records in some municipalities. The
cancellation of the Sandinista Renovation Movement's (MRS) and the
Conservative Party's legal status was decided after both parties failed
to meet routine legal prerequisites required of political parties under
Nicaraguan Electoral Law. The decision was vouched for by the Latin
American Council of Electoral Experts (CEELA). </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Nevertheless, the fact that the US Ambassador is so willing to repeat
and disseminate these snippets of misinformation is worth noting
inside and outside Nicaragua. It is particularly important given the
direct correlation between Trivelli's arguments and the arguments
repeatedly put forward by the Nicaraguan opposition, in local media and
in the international corporate media too. Opposition leaders regularly
describe the democratically elected president as a dictator. Some have
gone so far as to threaten to bring Ortega's government down by
force.<small>(3) </small></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">
The imminent arrival of Callahan</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Trivelli is scheduled to leave Nicaragua within the next few days,
handing over the post to someone who was a key collaborator in the US
organized Contra war, Robert J. Callahan. Callahan was a key member of
John Negroponte's team in the Honduran Embassy during the 1980s &#8220;dirty
war&#8221; there and&nbsp;also more recently in Iraq. It is strange and
worrying that the US government has decided to send such an experienced
wartime diplomat as Callahan to Nicaragua for the final six months of
George W. Bush's regime. US journalist Stephen Kinzer, in an article
published shortly after the announcement that Callahan was a likely
candidate to US Ambassador in Managua, asked "why would the United
States want to stick a finger in Nicaragua's eye by naming an
ambassador who helped inflict on the country the bloodiest conflict in
its history?"<small>(4) </small></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Back in January this year, when Callahan's nomination was announced,
Nicaraguan analysts agreed that the principal mission of the incoming
US diplomat would be to unite the opposition in an attempt to defeat
the FSLN at the ballot box during the municipal elections which will
take place in November. Retired army general and leading MRS
politician, Hugo Torres, said that without doubt Callahan's mission
would be to "bring new life to the project of liberal unity", while
analyst and social scientist Oscar Rene Vargas said, "an electoral
victory for the opposition would represent an enormous relief [for the
US] given that it would put a brake on the power of Daniel Ortega and
[Ortega's wife] Rosario Murillo."<small> (5) </small></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
One of the reasons behind the decision to replace Trivelli may have been to
break with his failed attempt to unite the opposition around Eduardo
Montealegre, former presidential candidate, on an "anti-pact",
"anti-corruption" and "pro-democratic" platform. Montealegre's
leadership has been ineffective and he is under criminal prosecution &#8211;
along with 39 other former public officials and bankers &#8211; for his
alleged role in Nicaragua's infamous CENIs financial scandal. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The potential for that prosecution to discredit Montealegre's
leadership further is enormous, especially since prominent
non-Sandinista figures like Nestor Avendaño and Francisco Mayorga have
challenged Montealegre to prove his innocence after Montealegre tried
to smear them. For the moment Montealegre enjoys parliamentary immunity
against prosecution.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Since Trivelli arrived in Nicaragua three years ago, he has stood firm
refusing to talk to disgraced former President Arnoldo Aleman, still
leader of the strongest Liberal Party grouping, the Constitutional
Liberal Party (PLC). Recent events suggest that despite Aleman's
conviction for multi-million dollar fraud against the State in 2003, he
still represents the best hope for unifying Nicaragua's fractious
opposition Liberal parties, a necessary part of any electoral strategy
to defeat Ortega. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Already there are signs that the right-wing parties are uniting around
Aleman, possibly spurred on by the multiple accusations involved in the
CENIS scandal prosecutions, which affect members of all&nbsp;factions
of the Nicaraguan Right. It may not be unreasonable to suggest
this is taking place on the initiative of, or at least with the
approval of, the US Embassy as part of preparations for Callahan's
support of a unified opposition around the corrupt former president on
the basis that there is no other way of defeating &#8220;totalitarian&#8221;
Ortega. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
That said, however, it is important to mention the lack of policy
alternatives being offered by the opposition parties which makes it
likely, according to recent polls, <small>(6)</small> that the FSLN will at least
maintain its hold on the majority of local governments in November's
upcoming municipal elections or even actually gain ground by increasing
the number of municipalities the party and its allies control. Faced
with that reality, the most viable option for an eventual electoral
victory - or any other kind of victory - for the opposition, probably
lies in creating a sense of increasing instability and general chaos. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">
An increase in provocations of political tension</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
With that thought in mind, it may be naive to assume Callahan's remit to undermine
Ortega's government will be limited to purely political means. Back in
June this year, the pro-FSLN radio station <span style="font-style: italic;">La Nueva Radio Ya</span> warned
that groups of young people trained by the CIA and the Spanish
far-right People's Party are operating in Nicaragua. According to the
radio station, these groups received training in "fomenting chaos"
during training sessions in Miami and Spain and will put their plans
into action in coordination with right wing media outlets like Channel
2 and <span style="font-style: italic;">La Prensa</span> and a number of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
"These are the same [type of] group that have sown violence in Bolivia
and Venezuela," Nicaragua's strategic allies in the Bolivarian
Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), reported <span style="font-style: italic;">La Nueva Radio Ya</span>.<small>(7) </small></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
In keeping with this worrying claim, political violence in the country
has increased, something atypical for Nicaraguan politics during the last
decade. On April 4th, thirteen people suffered gun shot wounds and
dozens more suffered minor injuries as a result of violence which broke
out between two groups in Bilwi, also known as Puerto Cabezas, in the
Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN), after a group of opposition
supporters attacked supporters of YATAMA, an indigenous political party
allied with the FSLN. The rival supporters were clashing over the
Regional Council's proposal to postpone municipal elections given the
ongoing state of emergency in the region after the devastation caused
by Hurricane Felix in September 2007. On the same day, First Secretary
of the RAAN Regional Council Centuriano Knight, who supported the
proposal, was attacked with metal bars by men he described as
supporters of Osorno Coleman,&nbsp; mayoral candidate of the PLC,
Nicaragua's main right wing party. The vandals also set fire to
Knight's house. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
During the transport strike in May this year, independent journalists
reported that anti social youths (i.e. not <span style="font-style: italic;">transportistas<span style="font-style: italic;">)</span></span> had taken part in
the burning of two truck tractor units.<small>(8)</small> Photos of this event, which
took place on the Pan American Highway in a town about 50 kilometers
north of Managua, were turned into emblematic images used by the
corporate press to create the impression that the strike was rapidly
spiraling out of control. Considering the government's flexibility, its
willingness to negotiate with representatives of the transport sector
and the strike's relatively short duration - twelve days - the numerous
outbursts of violence which took place were certainly unusual. The
notoriously long six month public health sector strike of 2006 provoked
no serious violent incidents despite the untold suffering inflicted on
the population and the Bolaños' government's totally inflexible
response. The&nbsp; contrast between the two disputes is striking. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
On July 31st this year, Antenor Peña, a TV journalist for the&nbsp;
pro-FSLN television Channel 4, was shot in the leg during an incident
which took place at Managua's central Ruben Dario roundabout. According
to independent media, the incident took place between members of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Movimiento Puente</span> (Bridge Movement) and a group of the Sandinista Youth
movement. <span style="font-style: italic;">Movimiento Puente</span> is a new anti-government group
paradoxically claiming to have no political affiliation. They demanded
the Sandinista Youth members leave the roundabout where the Sandinistas
had been publicising the government's National Literacy Campaign.
During the brief ensuing scuffle, shots were fired from a white truck
driving around the roundabout, one of which penetrated Peña's right
leg. <small>(9) </small></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
During the incident the Channel 4 vehicle belonging to Peña and his
colleagues was damaged by <span style="font-style: italic;">Movimiento Puente</span> members who smashed the
windscreen with stones. This is the third time in two months Channel 4
journalists have been threatened or physically attacked. In mid-June, a
Channel 4 vehicle was damaged and journalists threatened during an MRS
protest rally. At another opposition protest in mid-July, Channel 4
journalist Nelson Hurtado was kicked by MRS representative,
singer-composer Carlos Mejia Godoy. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
All these incidents have been reported in the local corporate media and
sometimes in the international corporate media as if the violence was
incited by the FSLN and its allies. Comparing the type of violent
incidents in Nicaragua over the last few months and the way they have
been reported in the local and international corporate media, it is
impossible not to note parallels with similar events in Venezuela and
Bolivia. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The US government's record in the region and Ambassador Callahan's
record in particular, suggest&nbsp; similar destabilization tactics
to those being used by the US government and its local allies in
Bolivia and Venezuela will be used in Nicaragua in the run up to the
municipal elections in November. Subsequently, they are likely to
continue, as part of wider US government destabilization efforts during
the last few months of George W. Bush's regime in countries where
policy and ideological changes that negatively affect US interests are
being implemented.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">
The SAM-7 missiles</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Meanwhile, on July 31st, Daniel Ortega announced his decision to
reject, for the moment, a US government offer in response to Ortega's
own suggestion that his government destroy 651 SAM-7 anti-aircraft
missiles in exchange for US medicines and equipment. Paul Trivelli
announced the US proposal informally, prior to standing down as US
ambassador. But Ortega said, at present, the conditions necessary to
destroy the missiles "do not exist", given increasing levels of tension
between Nicaragua and Colombia and the possibility that "at some point
it may occur" to Colombia to carry out an air attack on Nicaragua over
the maritime border dispute between the two nations. "The missiles are
the only thing we have to defend ourselves against an air attack," said
Ortega. He went on to say he will "study the US proposal carefully" and
"respond when the moment is right." (10)</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Washington has put immense pressure on Nicaragua to destroy the
Nicaraguan Army's SAM-7 missiles&nbsp;because they of the fear they could "fall
into the hands of terrorists." Former President Bolaños unilaterally
ordered the destruction of 1,000 missiles before the National Assembly
changed the law, making it impossible for the President to destroy
weapons without authorization from the legislature. Over a year ago
Ortega offered to destroy 651 of the remaining 1,051 Sam-7 missiles as
part of his suggestion for a mutually satisfactory exchange. The US
government, which&nbsp; expressed its approval of the proposal,
finally responded on July 28th with a list of medicine and equipment,
at a time when Nicaragua's relations with the closest US ally in Latin
America, Colombia, appear to be escalating towards dangerous levels of
tension. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">
Tense relations with Colombia</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Relations between Nicaragua and Colombia have worsened since the
illegal Colombian Army cross-border attack on a FARC (Revolutionary
Armed Force of Colombia) camp in Ecuador on March 1st. President Ortega
broke off diplomatic relations with Bogota on March 6th in solidarity
with Ecuador. The Nicaraguan government also feared Colombia might
carry out a similar attack against Nicaragua using as a pretext the
existing dispute over the maritime border which divides the two
nations. Relations were almost immediately resumed on March 7th after
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe made a verbal promise, which it has
subsequently failed to honour, to remove Colombian war ships stationed
on the 82nd meridian which Colombia considers to be its border with
Nicaragua. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
President Ortega's decision to grant humanitarian asylum to the three
survivors of Colombia's cross-border attack into Ecuador has also
caused fury in Colombia. The Colombian government has twice denounced
Nicaragua to the Permanent Council of the Organizations of American
States (OAS) for "harboring and protecting terrorists," but has not
filed a formal complaint. Colombian government officials regularly
refer to Ortega as a "friend of terrorists". For their part,&nbsp;
Nicaragua's representative at the Organization of American States has
referred to Uribe's government as a "narco-state" which "practices
state terrorism."<small> (11)</small> </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The situation between Nicaragua and Colombia was complicated recently
by a July 23rd article in Nicaragua's conservative newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">La Prensa</span>.
The article claimed six members of the FARC leadership met secretly
with Ortega in Managua on July 18th, prior to the celebration of the
29th anniversary of the Sandinista People's Revolution the following
day. Under the bold headline "Ortega received FARC leaders" the report
alleged six FARC leaders flew to Nicaragua from Venezuela in a plane of
the Venezuelan State oil company, PDVSA. The story is based entirely on
alleged claims by an unidentified "political source". <small>(12)</small>&nbsp; The report was then reproduced by international corporate news media
as if the allegations were factual. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
On July 16th this year, Ortega replied positively to a request from the
FARC to meet with him to discuss possible strategies for peace in
Colombia. But he denied the latest claims in <span style="font-style: italic;">La Prensa</span>'s report, saying
"if I had met [with the FARC], ... we would have done so publicly,
because there is no reason to go around hiding from anyone in order to
talk about peace." <small>(13)</small></span><small> <big>Ortega has accused <span style="font-style: italic;">La Prensa</span>'s directors of treason over the report, an accusation currently being investigated by the Attorney General. </big></small><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">
More smears against Ortega's government</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
On August 5, Nicaragua's relations with Colombia were
complicated further after Venezuelan corporate TV channel Globovision
"revealed" the names of two FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia) delegates the channel claim took part in the supposed secret
meeting with Ortega. Without mentioning any source, anonymous or otherwise, Globovision
announced that two of the FARC delegates who had met with Ortega were Ovidio Salinas (aka Juan Antonio
Rojas) and Alberto Bermudez (aka el cojo). The media company went on to
claim that Bermudez is the FARC representative in Cuba where "he has a
fluid relationship with the Nicaraguan Embassy." Finally, and most
significantly, it was claimed that the Colombian authorities in Cuba
are in the process of investigating whether or not the "mission"
discussed during the "secret meeting" is to facilitate the sale of
Nicaraguan Army SAM-7 missiles to the FARC. <small>(12)</small></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
It goes without saying that Ortega's decision not to destroy the
anti-aircraft missiles for the moment, will be used by the US and its
allies to paint Ortega as a warmonger. This most recent report by
Globovision, like the <span style="font-style: italic;">La Prensa</span> article before it, conveniently
provides ammunition for the US and Colombian authorities and their
propaganda media to report falsely that the Nicaraguan government is
arming the FARC. The US may only be a few simple moves away from
classifying Nicaragua as a terrorist State that supports terrorism.
That is a matter of concern, especially since Colombia's
President Alvaro Uribe, the most important US ally in the region, still
maintains warships on its disputed maritime border with Nicaragua.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
