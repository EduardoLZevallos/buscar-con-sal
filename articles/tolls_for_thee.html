      <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;The American fascist would
prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of
public information. With a fascist the problem is never how best to
present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive
the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more
power.&#8221; - </span>Henry A. Wallace, The Danger of American
Fascism,&nbsp; New York Times, April 9, 1944.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;There are many who do not know
they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes.&#8221;</span><br>
Ernest Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls, 1940*<br>
      <br>
That time is now and the analysis by Roosevelt's Vice-President, Henry
Wallace, has proven prescient : for fascist read oligarch. The
anti-American US ruling elite's betrayal of their country's people is
savage and comprehensive.&nbsp; A look at the domestic betrayals gives
a better understanding of the meaning of the betrayals on foreign
policy.<br>
      <br>
The abandonment of 14.3% of the population to poverty and 17% to
unemployment is accompanied by denial of the stagflation the great
majority experience in real life - stagnant incomes and price inflation
at anything between 3% and 7%.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve schemes to
sell back heavily depreciated assets cheap to the very banks from whom
they bought those same assets - at a premium over their market value -
as part of the rescue plan following the collapse in 2008. Willy nilly,
taxpayers will fund the difference - many billions of dollars.<br>
      <br>
A corollary of the financial sector's destruction of the US economy has
been the abandonment of accounting standards via opaque, barely
reported deals between major financial corporations, the Federal
Accounting Standards Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. Plenty of people have a mistakenly high opinion of the
FDIC. But the FDIC is probably heading for insolvency, again, and is in
any case, under Bush-appointee Sheila Bair, as compromised by corporate
oligarch influence as any of the other US authorities. <br>
      <br>
The pathetic folding of regulatory bodies like the FASB and the FDIC to
demands by corporate financial oligarchs compounds the overall failure
of US regulatory authorities to better manage the devastating collapse
of the financial system in the first place. In all likelihood, the US
legal system will before too long lurch from wholesale injustice to
irredeemable disrepute when Congress decides to bail out the banks'
hopelessly flawed procedures for securitizing mortgages with some
retrospective legislative patchwork.<br>
      <br>
The profound correlation between financial corruption and media
corruption is self evident from&nbsp; the role of the media in
misleading the people of the United States by misrepresenting the
catastrophic failures of their country's predatory elite. Either they
let pass ridiculous claims that the crisis was unforeseeable or else
they blamed the carnivorous elite's hapless victims.&nbsp; Similarly,
corporate accounts have for many years failed to give a true and fair
view of the insolvent state of numerous important companies, especially
the big banks. <br>
      <br>
Managed bankruptcy has always been, and remains, a readily applicable
option &#8211; one carefully censored from public discussion by the corporate
disinformation media. Four or five incompetent, criminal speculative
financial conglomerates with a few thousand grossly overpaid personnel
are too big to be allowed to fail. But tens of millions of vulnerable
impoverished citizens are treated as insignificant. <br>
      <br>
This truly is the logic of fascism, one the US media have generally
amplified and legitimized. Since World War Two the United States has
consolidated its power and influence to subjugate weaker countries
around the
world more effectively than ever in order to control their natural
resources. Now, as US power and
influence declines around the world, the assault-via-impoverishment is
being turned from vulnerable peoples overseas to the vulnerable
majority of people in the United States itself.<br>
      <br>
The foreign policy betrayal<br>
      <br>
Peoples and governments in the rest of the world &#8211; especially the
equally rotten elites in the European Union - know the US authorities
are hopelessly corrupt. The US legislature is permanently suborned by
corporate funding.&nbsp; The judiciary generally responds to corporate
or political influence at almost every level as in environmental cases
or the recent ruling on corporate political campaign finance or the
cases of political prisoners like Mumia Abu Jamal, Leonard Peltier and
the Cuban Five or the Angola 2, in solitary confinement for over 35
years.<br>
      <br>
US political, financial, media and judicial corruption spill seamlessly
over from the domestic sphere into foreign policy. The by now regular
scandals over revelations about the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan tell us
nothing new about those massive war crimes. From the very start those
wars were abominations of criminal inhumanity. From the very start, the
US authorities paid cash to buy innocent people whom they then
trafficked as political prisoners&nbsp; to Guantanamo and other
destinations, subjecting those people to vile, systematic torture. <br>
      <br>
Continuing crimes against humanity by the US government mirror overseas
the comprehensive domestic betrayal of people in the United States.
That international betrayal feeds back into the domestic arena via the
corporate media which currently serve mostly as echo chambers for US
government propaganda. An interesting feature of that reality in recent
years has been the incorporation of neocolonial progressive and radical
opinion into the official disinformation feedback process.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Examining foreign news coverage in the US &#8211; and international &#8211;
corporate media, one is struck by the uniformity of editorial opinion
among the news media of NATO-member countries. They sustain a
surprising continuity of themes within and across regions. Occasionally
events belie their propaganda. The recent massively welcoming visit to
Lebanon by the Iranian president confounded Western media caricatures
of President Ahmadinejad as an odious, insane pariah &#8211; a constant NATO
country media motif. <br>
      <br>
In Latin America, NATO country media have tried to peg the
odious-insane-pariah motif on leaders like President Hugo Chavez in
Venezuela and President Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. That same motif was
used to justify the coup d'&eacute;tat against President Manuel Zelaya
in 2009 in Honduras. Other false motifs deployed against Venezuela and
Nicaragua have included<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>the US government seeks stability in the region whereas the
Venezuelan government destabilizes the region;</li>
        <li>the US government seeks to promote democracy in Nicaragua
whereas President Daniel Ortega is corrupt, incompetent and
anti-democratic;</li>
        <li>US military deployments in the region, including
reactivating the Fourth Fleet, promote peace and stability.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
Arturo Valenzuela in Managua<br>
      <br>
A recent editorial in the Washington Post on Nicaragua gives a good
example of how the corporate media serve government propaganda
purposes. The editorial preceded by a few days a visit to Nicaragua by
Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Arturo
Valenzuela.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Washington Post's editorial takes on
greater interest in the light of remarks by Valenzuela following his
meeting with President Ortega in Managua.<br>
      <br>
Among the insincere banalities dropping from Valenzuela's forked tongue
, with memento mori Death's Head ambassador Robert Callahan smirking
beside him, was this, &#8220;We also discussed briefly the issue of Honduras
where we in the United States accompanied the consensus of OAS member
countries in condemning a coup d'&eacute;tat and in not accepting what
was an overturning of a democratic process...&#8221; <br>
      <br>
Valenzuela's downright
lie rewrites the shameful role of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and
Thomas Shannon. They all made sure the US government adamantly refused
to
denounce the coup in Honduras as a coup d'&eacute;tat. They refused to
do so because if they had it would have triggered a series of sanctions
they were unwilling to impose.<br>
      <br>
The US government actively sided with Roberto Micheletti's fascist coup
regime by insisting on treating them as equal partners in a fake
&#8220;dialogue&#8221; with the legitimate President Manuel Zelaya. US diplomats
consistently suggested that Zelaya himself was somehow to blame for the
military coup that illegally exiled him from his own country. The US
State Department then worked closely with the coup regime, buying them
time to stage the illegitimate elections that brought Porfirio Lobo to
power as a direct continuation of the coup.<br>
      <br>
The Washington Post on Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
When a senior diplomat insouciantly rewrites history, blatantly lying
about yet another US government betrayal of fundamental democratic
principles, it comes as no surprise that the State Department's
propaganda mouthpiece, the Washington Post, does the same. In their
disinformation editorial of October 20th &#8220;Nicaragua, Honduras and
hypocrisy&#8221; the editors contradict their own government by alleging the
events in Honduras from June 28th onwards were not a coup d'&eacute;tat.<br>
      <br>
They misrepresent the non-binding poll in Honduras scheduled for June
29th as an &#8220;illegal referendum&#8221;. They lie that President Zelaya sought
via the referendum to help overturn a ban on re-election. In fact the
poll posed a simple question to the Honduran people about whether they
wanted the right to vote on whether or not to hold a constituent
assembly to be held in the period of the President that would have
succeeded Zelaya under normal circumstances. <br>
      <br>
The editors argue, ridiculously, that the stalwartly right wing
Organization of American States was somehow railroaded by its minority
of left-leaning governments into condemning the coup. Even disingenuous
gangsters like President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Felipe
Calder&oacute;n of Mexico forthrightly condemned the coup. They
understood they could not approve the coup in Honduras without creating
an ominous precedent for their own corrupt regimes. <br>
      <br>
On the basis of their Munchausen syndrome account of the Honduran
military coup, the State Department propaganda frauds at the Washington
Post go on to make a grossly misleading comparison between Porfirio
Lobo's illegitimate violently repressive regime and the legitimately
elected government of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. Totally ignorant of
Nicaraguan constitutional history, they talk about &#8220;blatantly illegal
decrees&#8221; by Daniel Ortega, along with &#8220;manipulation of court rulings&#8221;
and &#8220;mob violence to clear the way for his re-election&#8221;. <br>
      <br>
Left out from this far-fetched distortion of events in Nicaragua is the
fact that the Nicaraguan opposition have a big majority in the
country's legislature. The obvious question is why, if Daniel Ortega,
is so undemocratic, the Nicaraguan opposition have failed to organize
an effective resistance. The clear answer to that question is that
President Ortega and his colleagues have consistently acted within the
Constitution and scrupulously followed the relevant procedures. <br>
      <br>
So when the Washington Post throws histrionics and asks why the OAS has
not reacted to the non-existent constitutional abuses allegedly
committed by President Ortega, the answer is the same. The OAS has no
reason to intervene in Nicaragua's internal affairs because President
Ortega's government has followed the constitutional rules. The
Washington Post's frauds allege that a Supreme Court ruling in favour
of Daniel Ortega's right to stand for re-election was made by a court
&#8220;composed entirely of Mr Ortega's Sandinista movement.&#8221; Another lie.
The court that made that judgment was composed of several
pro-Sandinista magistrates and also Liberal magistrates substituting
for their Liberal colleagues who had wantonly absented themselves from
Nicaragua's Supreme Court for several months.<br>
      <br>
The Washington Post propagandists also mess up their facts when they
write of President Ortega &#8220;The former Marxist dictator lost four
consecutive elections beginning in 1990..&#8221; Daniel Ortega was
democratically elected with over 60% of the vote in 1984. He was never
a &#8220;dictator&#8221;. Back then Washington Post darlings like Sergio Ramirez
willingly served in Nicaragua's elected government. The Washington
Post's pathetically weak grasp of Nicaraguan history rewrites events to
their proto-fascist taste.<br>
      <br>
All through 2010, the Nicaraguan opposition have tried to create
institutional chaos by unconstitutionally refusing to vote 25 top
official posts including Supreme Court magistrates and&nbsp; Supreme
Electoral Council officials. To resolve that crisis President Ortega
acted on a clause that was never revoked by the country's legislature,
one originally used to cover an institutional hiatus caused by the
handover of power following the elections in 1990. Outmaneuvered, the
Nicaraguan opposition falsely cried foul, a cry echoed by their foreign
supporters in the Washington Post.<br>
      <br>
The Washington Post fakers pretend that supplementary judges sworn in
to replace absent Liberal magistrates were all Sandinistas. That
enables the Washington Post to lie that a packed Sandinista Court
pushed through sensitive rulings in Daniel Ortega's favour. In fact the
Liberal magistrates were correctly substituted by their own
supplementary magistrates who then proceeded to deal with an enormous
backlog of thousands of routine cases neglected for months by their
Liberal colleagues. Subsequently, the Liberal magistrates who absented
themselves returned to work accepting every single one of their
colleagues' decisions without demur &#8211; including the ruling allowing
President Ortega to stand for re-election.<br>
      <br>
Left hand - Right hand<br>
      <br>
Arturo Valenzuela and his Washington Post buddies are a perfect example
of Goldman Sachs style ethics. Always get your left hand to deny what
the right hand is doing - the ethics of scam-mongers and cheap crooks.
Arturo Valenzuela lies that the US government condemned the coup
d'&eacute;tat in Honduras. The Washington Post celebrates it. One arm
of Goldman Sachs sells overpriced junk to its clients while another arm
bets that same junk will crash in value.<br>
      <br>
Barack Obama makes smarmy calls for understanding, as Valenzuela put it
in Managua: &#8220;Our vision with President Obama is to have a new deal with
the countries of our America.&#8221; But the reality Latin American peoples
and their leaders see is otherwise. <br>
      <br>
They see repeated militarist escalation via deployment of grossly
disproportionate menacing US armed forces throughout the region. They
experience reiterated covert support for anti-democratic oligarchies
like those that provoked the military coup in Honduras and its
attempted facsimile in Ecuador. They observe persistent funding to
co-opt non-governmental organizations in support of minority opposition
parties and partisan &#8220;electoral observers&#8221;. <br>
      <br>
They note continuing deep involvement of the CIA and the Drugs
Enforcement Agency with the regional drugs trade as well as the role of
US banks like Wells Fargo's Wachovia in laundering illicit proceeds
from that trade. They are well aware of US government double standards
in manipulating aid for development cooperation for political ends.
They resent continued interference by US government diplomats and other
officials in their internal affairs. <br>
      <br>
No one with high office in Latin America is likely to be fooled by
frauds like Arturo Valenzuela, Secretary of State Clinton or President
Obama. Everyone understands very well the cynical double dealing and
sadistic power politics that are the US government's stock in trade.
The
only ones fooled by the US government and its accomplices in the
corporate propaganda news outlets are the forever deceived people of
the United States, despicably and comprehensively betrayed by their
political, financial, commercial and media leadership.<br>
