after the Graduation Ceremony of the Officers of the Nicaraguan Army</strong></p>

<p><strong>December 10, 2021</strong></p>

<p>Good Day, Good Afternoon... Good Evening, These are Good Times we are living in.... Historic Times ! Times of Consolidation of Peace and Good, in our Nicaragua. Times in which to give thanks for the Gifts, the Miracles, the Portents, that God bestows on this Blessed, Dignified, Sovereign and Always Free nation, and on this Great Nicaraguan People, Heroic, Noble, Victorious. Our People and all of us who love Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Ceremonies like these, Events like these, Days like these, are Sacred for us, because here each one of us is breathing the Sacred Air that nourishes us, the Air that shares and carries our Love for Nicaragua, and the Love among ourselves, Love for our Neighbor, as a People of Good Christians, truly Christian, Fraternal, Brothers, Sisters, Socialists and in Solidarity.</p>

<p>How many achievements in these days, and how many achievements ahead, because every day in realizing or achieving the goals, the objectives that we set ourselves, small, or very small Actions, as well as big Events, Moments, Accomplishments, every day we know that we are Going Forward, All Together, and that we advance United.</p>

<p>We are together to enforce the Peace that the vandals, the terrorists, who now make themselves out to be "angels" wanted to deny us. What kind of angels? Unfortunately we saw the diabolic, perverse instincts that showed themselves in this Nicaragua that only knows Peace, that does not admit this diabolic, Mephistophelian perversion. We all saw it...!</p>

<p>And we saw people who pretended to be part of a Great Alliance and were in fact the standard-bearers of hatred, the standard-bearers of destruction, those who sponsored the criminal delinquents. Because, as Comandante Daniel said a moment ago, they did not get their own feet dirty out in some Barrio or at one of the roadblocks, they did not go out themselves to intimidate, to terrorize and kill. No...! They sent out others for that. Which is even worse. What kind of dirty conscience! What kind of evil conscience! What kind of hatred and lack of love! As our Comandante Daniel was saying, it is impossible to forget, and we must never forget !</p>

<p>This nation of ours has lived through so many episodes, throughout History, of provocation, of dishonor, of attacks, from the one Empire after another, and we have been learning more and more to preserve what is good, what is valuable, what must not be altered, and that is Peace ! Here Peace cannot be altered again. Here we are making our way, and for everyone, everywhere, the most important thing is Tranquility, Security, Stability, which allows us to continue making our way, All Together, along Paths of Prosperity.</p>

<p>As we make this painful journey, we also make the Patriotic Oath of Never Again! Not to allow it, as Nicaraguans that we are, Sincere Patriots, dedicated to the service to our People, not to allow any more this aggressive and country-betraying criminality, Never Again! Not allowing them to set foot in this Sacred Geography.</p>

<p>We are coming to Christmas, we are coming to the End of the Year, and we are heading into another Year of great challenges. But of so many advances ! This week alone how many advances, how many Victories...! This Restitution of Relations between Transcendent Revolutions such as the Revolution of the Communist Party of China and its People and of the Sandinista Revolution and the Sandinista Front, and now too between the Governments of the People's Republic of China and Nicaragua, this is historic, but also very important for the Future, and for the Present in which we are already changing Life, for the Good of Nicaragua's Families.</p>

<p>Life with Well-being, Life with Work, with Study and with all that is necessary to feel that we are Citizens of a Dignified World, because that is what we are here for and it is a reality of Dignity to which we have a Right.</p>

<p>Compañer@s, truly, one is also moved when one sees the Courage, the Nobility, the Bravery, the Integrity, of the Nicaraguan Army, of its Officers, Soldiers, its Command, its Military Council, its Cadets, Women, Men, who graduate to serve the nation and to consolidate Peace, that Peace which we all defend.</p>

<p>We have also been talking about Heroism in Nicaragua throughout all the Chapters of our History. Darío said it well: We are made of Vigor and Glory, and we are made, by History, for Humanity, for Freedom.</p>

<p>And when we relive those Personalities, Exceptional Characters, like the Priest and Comandante Gaspar Garcia Laviana, how proud we feel and how responsible we feel for taking care of the Nation; how proud we feel to see that God has given us the Privilege of having these Extraordinary, Magnificent, Formidable Human Beings, who leave us their Example, Inspiration and Legacy, for All.</p>

<p>When we speak of Youth we say, well, the Youth of all Times, the Youth that grows and moves forward, learning every day to Love Nicaragua, because that is what we all carry in our hearts: AMORANICARAGUA !</p>

<p>Those who do not love their Nation are really miserable, they are petty, they are, I say, Beings who unfortunately or for their own misfortune do not know of transcendent gifts. Because one can give oneself, or they, people like them give themselves over to what? To making money, just for themselves, serving Empire to come here to take from us, not to give to us, but to take from us.</p>

<p>That is what all the Empires have done, they have plundered, they have murdered, they have massacred, around the whole World; cutting off hands, cutting off heads. That is the History of the Empires and that is the History of the Fascists, and that is the History of the last Century and all the misfortunes that Fascism has caused in so many places.</p>

<p>I believe that, deep down, such people are deeply unhappy, because they do not know the transcendence of loving, in every task, in every gesture,  in everything we do, finding love as an Honor in every person.</p>

<p>How much Pride, we say, in having an Immense Heroic Heritage, Infinite, every day we can learn from one of our Heroes, and from so many Anonymous Heroes, National Heroes, Anonymous Heroes, Martyrs, and Families that have given their children, parents, siblings, grandparents, to the Nation, and for the Nation to defend itself and for our People to live better.</p>

<p>To defend the Nation with Love, to defend Peace in the Nation, with Love, that is what we dedicate ourselves to every day. We aspire and ask God to give us Faith, more Faith, more Strength, more Fortitude, to continue believing, and creating all these Times that we are now creating, and all those to come, which we are sure will be of even greater Successes and Victories, of more Prosperity for our Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Days of Good Will. Days to feel and be grateful for the Happiness of having our Nation that fills us with Pride. Days of Joy to share the Tranquility, the Harmony, the experience of Family.</p>

<p>How many countries in the world do not know the Family Culture, Family Values. Here we are not only a Great Family, but we live as a Family; no matter how humble we are, no matter how much we need a solution to so many problems, Family Love is still there, and that is an enormous capital, a Human Treasure.</p>

<p>So our Commitment is the same as always: To serve the People as we hope to serve Jesus Christ, God our Lord. And to serve the People while advancing United, encouraging more and more Unity every day so as to reach those Times of Happiness, of Progress, of Prosperity and of Joy... Happiness, Progress, Prosperity, Work, Security and Peace, in this Nicaragua Ever Blessed, Always Strong, Always Noble, Brave, Sovereign, Dignified and Free... Always full of Faith and Love for God !</p>

<p>Thank you, Compañer@s, and let us all Move Onward...! Let's Go Onward, Together, Always Further On, building the Future ! Many embraces and much Love. Thank you</p>
