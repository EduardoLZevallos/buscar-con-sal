In early January President Daniel Ortega instructed the Attorney
General's Office to make full use of the measures contemplated in
national legislation in an attempt to ensure the defence of the
nation's Biosphere Reserves - Bosawás and Indio Maíz.
Ortega also instructed the Nicaraguan Army to create an Environmental
Battallion, made up of soldiers specially trained in environmental
protection, with the fundamental purpose of protecting the nation's
reserves from illicit resource trafficking, and a specific
responsability regarding the protection of the two Biosphere reserves. <br>
      <br>
By the end of January the Environmental Ombudsman, José
Luis García, had
overseen the arrest and conviction of 27 individuals who have since
been
found guilty of coordinating the illegal posession and sale of land in
Bosawás and of violating relevant environmental legislation.
Currently
these 27 individuals are awaiting sentence.<br>
      <br>
These government actions, which make up part of a new hardline policy
after years of ineffective and counteractive government policies
regarding Bosawás, come just two months after a group of
representatives of the Mayagna People travelled to Managua in December
to express their utmost concern about the
effect illicit resource trafficking is having on Bosawás'
ecosystem. <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 421px; height: 440px;" alt="mapa etnica bosawas" src="images/bosawas_map.gif"><br>

According to the Mayagna People
hundreds of meztizo farmers (farmers from the Pacific side of
Nicaragua), who have acquired land within Bosawás illegally,
along with
the land and resource traffickers responsible for those illegal
landsales, are protagonizing a rapid expansion within Bosawás
which threatens to provoke irrevocable damage to the reserve's
ecosystem. <br>
      <br>
The Mayagna People are an indigenous people with a population of over
50,000 who have inhabited large parts of the area today referred to as
Bosawás for thousands of years and who were recently awarded
land titles corresponding to a large stretch of the Biosphere reserve.
Bosawás, which represents 15.25% of Nicaragua's national
territory, is also home to approximately 100,000 members of the Miskito
People.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The Bosawás Reserve, which was declared Patrimony of Humanity by
UNESCO in
1997, is the most extensive unaltered rain forest ecosystem in Central
America. <br>
      <br>
In January a number of environmental experts together with a commission
of public officials travelled to the reserve to verify the Mayagna
People's recent claims, concluding that, indeed, Bosawas' ecosystem is
under considerable threat as a result of extensive illicit land and
resource trafficking.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Of course, this conclusion is nothing new - local people and
environmentalists have been warning for years that timber felling and
the advancing agricultural frontier (mainly for cattle ranching)
represent grave threats to Bosawás. What has come as a shock to
many is the extent to which the reserve has already been damaged by
this type of activity. <br>
      <br>
Independent environmentalist Kamilo Lara is concerned about the fact
that, as the government-led delegation recently verified, resource
trafficking activity is rapidly encroaching, not only on the buffer
zone, but also on areas of virgin rain forest. Lara believes that up of
60% (or around 11,000 of the reserve's 19,896 square km) of the reserve
is affected to some extent by the traffickers' ongoing destruction. "At
this rate, " he says, "within ten years, Bosawás will be
history."&nbsp; <a href="http://ipsnoticias.net/wap/news.asp?idnews=94531">(1) </a><br>
      <br>
The situation is complex and potentially explosive. According to
official estimates there are now tens of thousands of mestizo farming
families living within the boundaries of Bosawás who purchased
the land as part of what they initially believed to be above-board
transactions. Now, as a result of recent government actions, these
farming families have discovered that their property titles are invalid
and that, potentially, they could be evicted. <br>
      <br>
The majority of the farming families are peasant farmers who, unlike
the minority of richer colonists who engage in large-scale cattle
ranching and intensive farming techniques, are unlikely to have the
capacity to contribute much to the
wider destruction of the reserve's ecosystem . <br>

      <br>
So far it is not clear to what extent the government's announced
hardline policy will differentiate between these different categories
of illegal Bosawás inhabitants, although at the beginning of the
month Environmental Ombudsman José Luis García announced
the imminent departure of an Attorney General led commission accompanied
by several members of the Nicaraguan Army to Bosawás to commence
the eviction of a number of illegal inhabitants who have not complied
with previous orders to leave certain properties. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
According to renowned Nicaraguan geographer and biologist Jaime Incer
Barquero (who is currently an environmental adviser to President
Ortega) another complicating factor is the complicity between resource
traffickers and a number of local government representatives.
Incer confirms that much of the essentially illegal activity in
Bosawás is carried out with permission from local government
authorities. <br>
      <br>
To exemplify the extent of the rapprochement between local authorities
and traffickers, Incer mentioned what are as yet unconfirmed plans by
the Siuna local government to authorize the construction of a road from
the town (situated just outside Bosawás) to the very heart of
the reserve's virgen rain forest expanse with the inevitable objective
of facilitating further timber felling activity. Should the existence
of such a plan be confirmed, said Incer, "then, of course, the
situation would have to be rectified."<br>
      <br>
Cirilo Otero, President of the Center of Environmental Policy
Initiatives (CIPA), does not believe that the government's announced
hardline policy is likely to work. "Intimidation has never managed to
detain environmental destruction before. ... What is necessary are
strong institutions, financial resources to provide campesino farmers
with alternatives ... and lots of environmental education." <a href="http://ipsnoticias.net/wap/news.asp?idnews=94531">(2)</a><br>
      <br>
Brooklyn Rivera, leader of the Miskito political organization YATAMA,
meanwhile, is pessimistic about the army's capacity to effectively
stall
resource trafficking given the precedents he claims exist of army
officials accepting bribes to turn a blind eye to illegal timber
felling activity. <a href="http://ipsnoticias.net/wap/news.asp?idnews=94531">(3)</a>
These claims are denied by Omar Halleslevens, head of the Nicaraguan
Army. <br>
      <br>
Jaime Incer Barquero, however, says he approves of the government's
plans to implement a policy
involving army presence and patrols in Bosawás. This sort of
policy "is necessary because other measures have been
tried and have failed. ... State presence is necessary in the most
vulnerable points of the reserve" in order to detect and detain timber
felling and other illegal activities. <br>
      <br>
Incer feels confident that, after twenty years of failed government
policies, and thirteen years&nbsp; of wasted international funding
provided to protect Bosawás since 1997 when it was declared a
biosphere, the Nicaraguan government is now actually beginning to take
steps in the right direction regarding the defence of Bosawás. <br>
      <br>
"Previous governments," he said, "presented wonderful plans, they did
great presentations, ... but nothing was actually done on the ground to
protect Bosawás from invaders. There was no effective State
presence. They didn't bother to take into account what the local people
were saying. Over the years there has been a lot of funding for the
protection of Bosawás, but [the policies implemented] haven't
worked." &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Many journalists believe there are powerful political and economic
interests which would be seriously disadvantaged should an effective
hardline policy against resource trafficking in Bosawás be
applied. According to Incer a certain level of complicity between local
authorities and resource traffickers can be taken for granted. <br>
      <br>
Should links exist between traffickers and political or economic movers and shakers at national or even
international level, however,
something which is by no means out of the question, then the situation
may well become impossible for the government to deal with.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Netan Mordy, a member of the Mayagna People's governing organization,
believes the Environmental Ombudsman's sudden decision to suspend the
planned trip to evict a number of illegal inhabitants can be put down
to threats of an armed uprising by the meztizo farmers affected, who,
Mordy and his colleagues believe, respond to interests much greater
than their own. Interests, he claims, that are intertwined with
representatives both of the PLC and FSLN. <a href="http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2010/02/04/nacionales/118495">(4)

      <br>
In Guatemala and El Salvador a number of individuals committed to the
defence of natural resources and biodiversity have been murdered over
the last few months after their struggle came too close to stepping on
the toes of the rich and powerful. It is wIth that regional context in
mind, that observers should analyze the coming struggle of the State
against the structures of such a lucrative illicit trade in Nicaragua. <br>
