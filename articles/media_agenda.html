<span style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">By
Karla Jacobs, January 9th 2009</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In Nicaragua,
as in many other nations around the world, the onslaught
of
global capitalism has turned the main national media outlets into
obstacles between society and information essential for social
well-being. Relevant information, opinions
and ideas, necessary to overcome the nation's most pressing social,
cultural and economic problems,
are seldom discussed at any length by Nicaragua's corporate media
outlets. As is the case in many other parts of the world, this
situation is caused mainly by the simple fact that the owners and
sponsors who exercise almost exclusive control over the informative and
cultural content of the main media outlets form part of powerful
economic groups with
aspirations that go against the well-being of society as a whole.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">While on the
one hand the entertainment or cultural content of the main
TV channels, radio stations and the Press in the country is generally
commercialized and frivolous, and&nbsp;usually imported from
foreign media corporations. On the other hand,
national news and
information programs are </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> generally </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">presented from a point
of view which goes against the interests of most Nicaraguans.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It is true
that the media outlets aligned with the FSLN progressive
government provide an alternative source of information and, to a
lesser extent, an alternative source of cultural content. It can be
argued, however, that these media outlets, like
their corporate counterparts, mostly fail to contribute to a
constructive
debate about the main issues that concern the majority of the
population. Among the list of
pro-government outlets are the semi-FSLN owned
Channel 4 and Nueva Radio Ya and the FSLN's weekly party political
newspaper El 19.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Imported
entertainment, imported
values</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<strong style="font-family: sans-serif;"></strong>
<strong style="font-family: sans-serif;"></strong><strong style="font-family: sans-serif;"></strong><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The vast
majority of the entertainment content broadcast on Nicaragua's TV
channels (including Channel 4) is imported, along with
certain sets of cultural norms and social stereotypes. Action films and
other blockbusters are imported from the US while&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">telenovelas
</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">and
"reality TV" shows
are imported from larger Latin American countries like Mexico and
Brazil. Meanwhile, only a tiny number of the thousands of music
programs broadcast on Nicaraguan radio are dedicated to the promotion
of anything other than commercial, imported music. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In the case
of films and TV programs, it is understandable that the
vast majority are imported given that very few have ever been produced
in Nicaragua. It is not so easy to accept the failure to promote non
commercial Nicaraguan and Latin American music, however, given the long
and healthy tradition of folk and testimonial music Nicaragua shares
with the rest of Latin America, and the population's enthusiasm for
those musical genres. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This
overwhelming bombardment of imported commercial entertainment
contents has led to a progressive process of cultural denaturalization
and
contributed to certain cultural and psychological trends within
Nicaraguan society like the widespread installation of consumerist
mentality, the normalization of street violence, the reinforcement of
oppressive gender stereotypes and the cultural isolation of
impoverished communities. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">From
Nota Roja to media
terrorism </span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In terms of
the presentation of news and information the </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">nota
roja</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
(red note) style of
reporting dominates many outlets' reporting. </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">Nota
roja</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
(think red as in blood)
style reporting is typified on TV news programs like Acción 10,
22 22, the daily tabloid Hoy and news updates on La Nueva
Radio Ya. In this sort of reporting much time is dedicated to gory
details (close ups of car crash victims' wounds, for example) and
coverage of domestic or local confrontations between individuals or
groups (who are, incidentally,
almost exclusively from marginalized communities) while little if any
importance is given to the social, political or other relevant context
within which such events take place. This sort of voyeuristic reporting
normalizes violence and encourages disrespect for the dignity of
individuals and social groups from impoverished
communities. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Among the
news outlets that do not focus efforts around </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">nota
roja</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
style reporting are the
newspapers La Prensa, El Nuevo Diario and El 19, Channel 2's TV
Noticias and Channel 4's Multinoticias. While on one side of the fence
the two
daily newspapers (El Nuevo Diario and La Prensa) and TV Noticias are
aligned with the right-wing
&nbsp;and centre-right opposition and present political and other
information in such a way so
as to undermine the government's every move, on the other El 19 and
Multinoticias believe the government can do no wrong. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Independent
writers and communication experts have written at length
about how the corporate media in Latin America is used to undermine
popular efforts for political and social change. The
Nicaraguan corporate media has proved itself to be no exception
demonstrating, since the
FSLN government came to power in January 2007, that it has no qualms
about engaging in systematic
falsification of information. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This
falsification process includes omission, manipulation, baseless
claims and unfair insinuations. Successful government programs are not
reported about. Facts, figures, images and statements are manipulated
so
as to shine a bad light on any and all government activity. Claims that
cannot be backed up with documentation or factual evidence are
presented as solid arguments. Questions about the transparency of
official transactions are raised without any effort to clarify whether
or not there is a valid answer.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This sort of
anti reporting is designed prevent readers, viewers and
listeners putting news items into a realistic context so as to ensure a
lack of
understanding about key issues. In this sense the opposition media
practice a form of media terrorism, as defined in the </span><a style="font-family: sans-serif;" href="http://www.alopresidente.gob.ve/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,0/task,doc_view/gid,355/">Caracas
Declaration</a><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
(which came out of the First Latin American Encounter
Against Media Terrorism in March 2008). In this declaration, signed by
independent journalists and social communicators from across Latin
America, media terrorism is described as "a form of permanent massive
aggression" used by "information corporations" to "undermine people and
governments that struggle for peace, justice and inclusion." </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">In
self defense FSLN denatures
its own media outlets</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In response
to the aggressive attitude of the opposition media the FSLN
aligned news and information outlets have adopted a reporting style
based on uncritical praise of the government. While these media outlets
are important in that they provide a range and depth of information
about government activities and policies not available anywhere else,
the
strictly uncritical nature of the reporting style means very few
non-FSLN supporters ever make use of them. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Seldom, if
ever, will Multinoticias, La Nueva Radio Ya or El 19 include
contributions which could be considered as constructive criticism of
the government, although, vicious statements from fierce opponents are
often incorporated as a justification for
the use of similarly vicious statements against those opponents. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">William
Grigsby, director of the independent radio La
Primerísima, spoke about this phenomenon in </span><a style="font-family: sans-serif;" href="../tortillaconsal.com/william_grigsby.html">an
interview</a><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
with Tortilla con Sal in October. Grigsby believes that the FSLN have
"made a big mistake. They have distorted the party's media outlets.
It's true that there is an explanation for that: the government is
being hounded, the right wing is hounding the government with all means
available. And the government is simply defending itself. But sometimes
I think that it defends itself in the wrong way. I think the way it is
using its media is mistaken. The FSLN media have been turned into
instruments of propaganda. They are no longer communication media as
such."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">FSLN
should raise awareness to
maintain majority<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">By
putting off viewers, readers and listeners in
households that have not traditionally supported the FSLN, the party
may well be
losing out on the opportunity to raise awareness about
the real issues facing Nicaraguan society today. It is also not in a
good position to counteract commonly held
misguided beliefs about what the government can and cannot do in terms
of providing solutions for the most pressing concerns of the
Nicaraguan population. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It is one
thing, from an academic point of view, to write about how the
sort
of economic and social policies that have been implemented by the FSLN
government over the last two years are generally appropiate, given the
complex
national
social and economic situation. It is quite another for ordinary
Nicaraguans, who have been culturally and intellectually undermined by
neo-liberalism in all its different forms, to unravel
the web of misinformation and
understand the limitations experienced by the government. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In the recent
municipal elections the FSLN won an overall national
majority, presumably due mainly to the successful social programs which
have been implemented
over the last two years. It may well be the case, however, that, for
many non-traditional FSLN
voters who voted for the party in the November elections,
a change substantial enough to ensure future commitment to the
FSLN is yet to be felt. If the FSLN is to secure an unshakable overall
majority going in to the 2011 presidential elections it is essential to
raise awareness among the population about the mechanisms of
imperialism and the current geo-political situation in Latin America.
&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There are so
many innovative and exciting ways this type of work could
be carried out; Nicaraguan cultural inheritance provides endless
opportunities for relevant messages to be communicated in a subtle and
appealing way. Of course the profound changes to the national
curriculum which will be brought in later this month represent one very
important trench in this multifaceted struggle. In terms of media
presence the FSLN may well need to rethink its approach. At present the
corporate
media is still setting the
agenda.</span> </td>
