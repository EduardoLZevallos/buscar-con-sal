<p><b>Message of President-Comandante Daniel for the Patriotic Parade</b><br />
<b>in Commemoration of the 166th Anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto</b><br />
<b>and the 201 of the Independence of Central America</b><br />
<br />
<b>September 14, 2022</b><br />
<br />
Beloved Brother and Sister Nicaraguans, beloved Families, from this Avenue Bolívar to Chávez we greet all the communities of the different territories of our country, from the banks of the Coco River, along the border with Honduras, which are the communities of the original peoples, from the borders with Costa Rica, where the San Juan River is and where there are the communities, the peoples of Rio San Juan.<br />
<br />
San Juan, yes, the San Juan River and the port areas, that in the midst of conflicts, rivalries, of those fighting each other to dominate the World, disputing these Lands of Our Latin and Caribbean America that did not belong to them, there were the Empires, from the Spanish Empire to the British Empire, and the North American Empire also disputing these Lands in those great contradictions unleashing bombardments, back in those years, when they already saw that Nicaragua had an immense Future, the Canal Route was already being appraised since that time, and that is what the Spaniards, the English were disputing, along with the French, the Germans.<br />
<br />
And in the midst of these contradictions between them all, in order to take over Nicaragua, which was dominated by Spain, half of Nicaragua, the other half dominated by England, they bombed San Juan, the port of Río San Juan, there. Back then, mind, those bombardments, not for Peace, not for Life, but simply because they wanted to take over Nicaragua, and thence to  go ahead with the Canal through Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
And so precisely for that reason William Walker came to Nicaragua, the Yankees came to Nicaragua, introduced by bad Nicaraguans who were fighting against each other, and so they brought in Walker. And the US companies were already traveling that route, from New York to the San Juan River the boats came, and then they went along the river, and they crossed the Lake, and back then they had stagecoaches there waiting for the passengers, all of them from the US, who were going from the East Coast of the United States to the West Coast, because there was a Gold Rush and of course they wanted and were seeking wealth.<br />
<br />
They followed that route, you see, and then after crossing the Isthmus of Rivas they took ship again and headed for the West Coast, there in the area of San Francisco and Los Angeles, where now there are so many Latin Americans, so many Nicaraguans, so many Central Americans, so many Mexicans, emigrants who are there striving to make a life.<br />
<br />
It was under those conditions, after Walker had already become President of Nicaragua, accompanied at his Inauguration by the Ambassador of the United States of America, bleeding our nation dry. But there was, indeed, also the Dignity of those Nicaraguans who could not accept, in that new period Central America was already going through, they could not accept being dominated by North American expansionism. And that is when the Glorious Battles take place, where Workers, Peasants, the Indian archers of Matagalpa, united in a single People, in a single nation, defended what had already been achieved throughout Our America and especially in the Central American Region, which was Independence from Spain.<br />
<br />
Such that, in 1821 came Independence of Spain, and immediately in the 1850s Nicaragua was already being disputed by those great powers. And at that point the Nicaraguan People rose up, the Dignity of Central American Peoples who, united as Brothers and Sisters, offered their Lives, their Blood, their Sacrifice, until they defeated those we know today as the Yankee Filibusters. They were defeated! They couldn't prevail, they couldn't take over Nicaragua!<br />
<br />
Such that it was a short time that Walker acted as President behaving as the owner of Nicaragua, but the People in various combats, in different battles and in that Heroic Battle of San Jacinto, under the command of the General José Dolores Estrada, National Hero and National Hero Sergeant Andrés Castro, with their Courage, their Dignity, with their Patriotism, achieved the defeat of the Filibusters. A small part of our history.<br />
<br />
But pay close attention, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, what were they after? The Canal Route! And the Canal, truly, at some point the Canal will be a reality here in Nicaragua. Why? Because while it is true there's a Canal through Panama that has been expanded, the demands of international sea traffic are so great that the Canal through Nicaragua is necessary.<br />
<br />
But the Canal through Nicaragua will be for the Peoples, for Peace, for the greater development of the Economy of our Country, and for all our brothers and sisters who are watching us in the Cities, in the Countryside, in the Regions, in the Miskito Communities, Mayagnas, in the Afro-Descendant Communities in the Bluefields area, the Garifuna brothers and sisters and the Ramaquí brothers and sisters of the little islands located there in Bluefields, a community that has held on to its Roots.<br />
<br />
So that all of you, so that all of us, sister and brother Nicaraguans, so that all our Families can continue living in Peace, guaranteeing above all the life of Nicaraguans, guaranteeing the health of Nicaraguans, both the elderly and the children; guaranteeing education for all Nicaraguan Families. Yes, Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and the new Technological Schools which are multiplying in all our Communities.<br />
<br />
University education is also being installed in different territories of our Country. It is no longer the University only of León, as it was originally, and then in Managua. Not now, now universities have multiplied all over our country, and they will continue to multiply... Thanks to Peace!<br />
<br />
Peace is fundamental for Work, for Agricultural Production, for the development of Livestock, for the development of all Economic, Industrial Activities, Small Businesses, Medium-sized Enterprises, the micro Family Business, the corner shops, the street food stalls. So that all this activity contributes to Peace, provide their services in Peace, for leisure activities, because the People have the Right to Leisure, to Joy, to Music, to Dance, to Folk Dance, to Theater, to Singing, to Theater Plays, to everything that has been multiplying in our country, where no Nicaraguan can be discriminated against.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the economic and social conditions, here the days are gone when working people, humble people, who are the majority of the Nicaraguan people, were discriminated against, exploited, marginalized, and there was class discrimination, yes, and racial discrimination too, racism, against our Indigenous Roots, which are simply inhuman attitudes and behaviors.<br />
<br />
Not now, now we have been moving forward, always fighting against those who try to restore what will no longer return. That Past of Extreme Poverty, that Past of Death, that Past of Wars, that Past will never come back! That Past is buried forever!<br />
<br />
Now what we have is a People looking towards the Light, both looking towards the Future, making their way towards the Future, rain or shine, but with Joy and with that Spirit given to us by  our Heroes and Martyrs in the Battle that was fought in San Jacinto, and in different territories of our Country, including those Heroic Battles like that of Rivas.<br />
<br />
This day, September 14 of this year 2022, brother and sister Nicaraguans, all of you, from your Homes, from your hearts, from your feelings, we are all going to swear our Loyalty to our Motherland, and this Oath before the Flag, by the students, by the young people who are present here, and those too who are present in their homes with their Families and who are watching this Ceremony on television:<br />
<br />
We swear, beloved Boys, beloved Girls, beloved Students, We swear to God, to the Nation, to our Families, to our Heroes and National Heroes, that we will continue studying with vocation and spirit of service to fulfill our personal dreams and contribute to the development of our Country, so that every day in Peace and Tranquility we lead a Dignified Life, in which all Nicaraguan Families feel strong and blessed, with our Model of Christian, Socialist and Solidarity Ideals and Values.<br />
<br />
This is how make this oath before God, before the People, before the Nation, and thus God Willing we will fulfill it.<br />
<br />
To all of you are Young People, to this Youth, to the Boys, Girls, of 5 years, 4 years, of 6 years, all this Youth who given this, God Gift to his People. This is a Gift for all Families, from those who are better off, to those in more humble circumstances, all who have managed to witness on television this beautiful Gift of Love and of Peace. This is a Gift from Christ, a Gift from God, for our Nicaraguan Families.<br />

<h3><b>Remarks by Compañera Rosario, Vice-President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the Patriotic Parade</b></h3>

<h3><b>September 14, 2022</b></h3>

<p>We feel very content...!  A very good night,  a very good afternoon, a very good day, good times for those who live in this Nicaragua of Ours, Blessed and Dignified, Always Sovereign, Forever Free and full of Love!<br />
<br />
Here we are illuminated by a Sun that never sets, and that Sun now shines on all the new Victories of this People that is All of Us, these Families that are All of Us: Laborers, Workers, Generous, Loving, Victorious People...!<br />
<br />
On this Day of the Battle of San Jacinto we have talked so much, about what it means as a symbol of our Heroism and our National Dignity.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, the 15th, the Independence of Central America, which Nicaragua defends, Heart and Soul, the Independence and Sovereignty of the Nation. This Nation that we love so much, which is why we say with such pride: Our Nation prevails! And why is there this Nation...? Because we are Patriots, because we are capable of defending what is ours: our Lands, our Models, our Way of Living, of relating to and understanding each other. Because they are traditional ways of living, of understanding... our Culture, our Identity!<br />
<br />
And here we want no more interference from foreigners, and this Heroic People has said this with Blood and our Hero, our General Sandino, our Dario has said it: We are a Free People, and because we are Free we are Indomitable!<br />
<br />
Warm embraces, and may we have a good week of festivity, of Joy that is the Gift of God that characterizes us Nicaraguans; of Family, of Faith, of Community! An embrace, Compañeros and Compañeras.</p>
