the "International Community" really willing to support food security</span>

<div style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">The
"international community" (namely, rich country governments and the
multilateral international organizations they dominate) succeeded in
demonstrating its unwillingness to resolve the global majority's severe
food insecurity during the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
summit in Rome. Meanwhile in Latin America a number of progressive
governments, including the Sandinista FSLN government in Nicaragua, are
taking steps to reverse the state of nutritional insecurity imposed on
most countries in the region. The initiatives being undertaken by
President Daniel Ortega's government in Nicaragua reflect the
recommendations made recently by the UN High Level Task Force on the
global food crisis, recommendations subsequently taken up in the final
declaration of the FAO summit. It remains to be seen, however, whether
the international élite will allow such programs to succeed.<br>
<br>
It
is hard not to feel dismayed by the extent of the hypocrisy expressed
at the FAO summit (World Food Security: the challenges of climate
change and bioenergy, Rome, Jun. 3 - 5) by rich nation diplomats and
their (perhaps to some extent reluctant) accomplices in the UN, World
Bank and the World Trade Organization. <br>
<br>
While World Bank
President Robert Zoellick warned that "without fast action, this crisis
will steal the potential of a generation," (1) UN Secretary General Ban
Ki Moon said "today's problems will only grow larger if we do not act
now," neither of these two most influential men pushed at the summit
for a comprehensive timeframe within which the recommendations made in
the final declaration should be implemented.<br>
<br>
During their
speeches to the plenary and subsequent comments to the press, both
Zoellick and Ban Ki-moon, along with FAO Director General Jacques
Diouf, World Trade Organization Director General Pascal Lamy and US
Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer, insisted that doubling global food
production over the next few decades would help to guarantee global
food security. None of them bothered to mention, however, that
according to the FAO, the world already produces enough food to feed
itself twice over, (2) or that the three fold increase in global food
production registered between 1961 and 2007 has not helped to reduce
levels of malnutrition significantly in the world's poorest countries.
(3)<br>
<br>
One can be relatively confident in assuming that figures
like Robert Zoellick, Pascal Lamy, Ed Schafer and other rich nation
representatives enjoyed excessive influence in drafting the summit's
final declaration. So it was no suprise that the document not only
failed to include a specific timeframe, but also failed to commit rich
nations to eliminate or reduce agricultural subsidies. There was no
commitment to take concrete steps towards mitigating the effects of
climate change for which they are mainly responsible nor did those
countries undertake to suspend or reduce biofuel production or donate
resources to finance the recommendations made in the same document. (4)<br>
<br>
Considering
the severity of the current global food crisis and the unquestionable
role multi million dollar agricultural subsidies for export crops in
rich nations, carbon dioxide emission triggered climate change and
largescale biofuel production have played in creating and exacerbating
that crisis, the declaration's final pledge, "to eliminate hunger and
to secure food for all today and tomorrow," seems tragically
unrealistic.<br>
<br>
Ziegler: summit a "true scandal" <br>
<br>
According
to Jean Ziegler, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for the UN
Human Rights Commission, the outcome of the summit is a "true
scandal:&nbsp;private interests have been imposed over the [global]
common interest. The decisions taken in Rome may even provoke an
increase in levels of hunger around the world." (5) Representatives of
the International NGO/CSO Planning Committee's simultaneous forum
"Terra Preta" (fertile earth), concluded that the Rome declaration
"will not fill even one empty plate." (6)<br>
<br>
Interestingly the
loudest voices of objection from within the plenary hall were Latin
American. During the final plenary session the Argentinian delegate
criticized the lack of concrete measures in the final declaration and
came to the conclusion that "if one diagnoses a problem incorrectly,
one will not prescribe a suitable remedy, which is what has happened at
this summit." (7) This comment sparked a series of fierce criticisms
from other Latin American delegates, representatives of more
progressive leftwing governments.<br>
<br>
Progressive government delegates object final declaration <br>
<br>
The
Venezuelan delegate said he "deeply regretted ... the lost opportunity
to fight against this scourge. ... Hunger in the world is a structural
problem," he<br>
said, "resulting from patterns of distribution and
consumption." The Nicaraguan delegate said she had hoped for a "more
realistic" declaration not one which failed to reflect the "fundamental
contributing factors of this crisis."&nbsp; For the Cuban delegate
the
declaration represents the "lack of political will from the North to
put a definitive end to hunger in the world." Delegates from Ecuador
and Bolivia also spoke out against the general lack of committment in
the final document before the plenary chairperson said he could not
allow any more interventions. <br>
<br>
If one takes a brief look at the
type of food security measures being implemented by the governments
these delegates represent, it becomes clear that, unlike rich nation
and international financial/trade organization delegates, they actually
do have a moral leg to stand on during forums like the FAO summit in
Rome. <br>
<br>
In Venezuela, the state owned food distribution company
PDVAL plays a crucial role in ensuring internal food security by buying
basic goods directly from producers or importers and distributing them
across the country at fixed prices, thus reducing the negative impact
of hoarding and speculation. Simultaneously, the government subsidized
food chain, Mercal, provides the most impoverished sectors of society
with access to basic products at substantially discounted
rates.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In Cuba the success of food production and distribution policies
implemented<br>
over
the last 50 years by the country's revolutionary government have
resulted in "remarkably low percentages of child malnutrition,"
according to the FAO nutrition country profile, which put Cuba "at the
forefront of developing countries." (8)<br>
<br>
While reading through the FAO summit's final declaration and listening
to the<br>
speeches
of rich nation diplomats, specifically that of US Agricultural
Secretary Ed Schafer, anyone familiar with government policy in
Nicaragua will be struck by the correlation between many of measures
recommended to combat hunger in developing countries and the sort of
agricultural and rural economic policies the Sandinista government has
been implementing in Nicaragua. <br>
<br>
Among the UN High Level Task
Force recommendations were to "boost smallholder farmer food production
through an urgent injection of key inputs (seeds and fertilizers) in
time for this year's planting seasons." Schafer echoed this idea in his
address to the plenary: "our approach is to support the rapid increase
of production and availability of key staple foods in developing
countries ... and access to rural credit and livelihood programs for
farming families."<br>
<br>
Zero interest loans for small farmers<br>
<br>
The
Ortega government has been successful is providing zero interest rate
material loans (certified seeds and fertilizers) for over 177,000
smallholder farmers to produce basic grains this year. The loans will
be repayable with agricultural produce at harvest time.&nbsp; The
Rome
summit final declaration underlined the importance of developing
countries increasing their stock capacity and implementing food
distribution networks to guarantee access to basic products for the
most impoverished sectors of society. Schafer also underlined the need
for "investment in distribution networks and storage facilities." <br>
<br>
Food for the People program<br>
<br>
The
Nicaraguan government is currently working on the reactivation of the
ENABAS (National Basic Food Company) warehouses nationwide as part of
their program ("Food for the People"). Over the last year and a half
ENABAS has been working to incoporate as many smallholder farmers and
agricultural cooperatives as possible into the government program. In
November 2007 it was reported that ENABAS had signed agreements with
over 50,000 smallholder farmers and 72 agricultural cooperatives to buy
basic grains and other basic food products at fixed rates. ENABAS
distributes the produce bought from local farmers directly to the
community supervised points of sale in impoverished neighborhoods and
communities which are being set up across the country, where they are
sold on to the population at below market rates.<br>
<br>
In the FAO
summit final declaration it was stated: "We support the development of
agricultural systems and sustainable forest management practises that
positively contribute to the mitigation of climate change and
ecological balance." Here it is worth mentioning two Nicaraguan
government initatives which should warrant the support of those
countries that signed the final declaration; the "Zero Hunger program"
and the "National Reforestation Cruzade." <br>
<br>
Zero Hunger Program<br>
<br>
The
"Zero Hunger" program, which is coordinated by the Ministry of
Agriculture (MAGFOR) is essentially the widespread implementation of a
model pioneered by the Nicaraguan NGO CIPRES during the last decade or
so. This model constitutes a realistic, ecologically friendly,
integrated proposal for the revival of impoverished campesino families'
productive capacity so they can again become self sufficient in food
production and sell surplus basic food products locally. The model is
adjusted to the economic, social and environmental realities of rural
Nicaragua today. <br>
<br>
Those families chosen to participate in the
program are awarded a food production package which includes a pregnant
cow, a pregnant sow, chickens, a cockerel, seeds, fruit trees,
endangered forestry species saplings, a gray water filter (which
recycles soapy or dirty water so it can be reused for irrigation), a
biodigestor (which produces cooking gas from animal dung thus
eliminating the damaging effects of firewood usage on the environment
and on human health) and other essential tools and materials. The goods
are registered exclusively in the name of female campesinas who must
commit to producing food, reforesting part of their land and to not
selling on anything from the original production package. <br>
<br>
The government's aim is to integrate 75,000 smallholder farming
families into<br>
the
"Zero Hunger" program before 2012. Last year MAGFOR gave out 13,000
food production packages. MAGFOR is on course to award 14,537 packages
during 2008.<br>
<br>
National Reforestation Crusade<br>
<br>
When the
Sandinista (FSLN) government came to power in January 2007 a National
Reforestation Crusade was announced. Some reports estimate that over
60% of Nicaragua's forests have been destroyed during the last fifty
years. The crusade aims to mitigate the devastating effects of massive
deforestation during recent decades on the local environment, the
livelihood of the most vulnerable sectors of the population, on public
health and on the national economy. It is important to note that the
vast majority of the timber felled in Nicaragua is exported by
multinational companies and therefore leaves little to no economic
benefit behind it. <br>
<br>
The initial aim of the National
Reforestation Crusade's for the five year governmental period (2007 &#8211;
2012) was to reforest 300,000 hectares, or 60,000 hectares a year.
Despite falling significantly short of these perhaps unrealistic
initial aims, the FSLN government was able to reforest an area five<br>
times
larger (14,000 hectares) than the average area reforested by previous
governments during the last forty years (2,333 hectares). <br>
<br>
The
National Reforestation Crusade is supervised by the the National
Forestry Institute (INAFOR) in coordination with other state
institutions and local governments which promote and facilitate the
participation of members of the general population including school and
university pupils and members of the recently established Councils of
Citizen Power. <br>
<br>
Finally the FAO summit final declaration stated that "South-South
cooperation<br>
must
be encouraged," and that considering the "urgent need to help
developing countries expand agriculture and food production, all
relevant organizations and cooperating countries should be prepared to
assist countries, on their request, to put in place the revised
policies and measures to help farmers, particularly small scale
producers."<br>
<br>
Could OPEC subsidize HIPC agriculture?<br>
<br>
On
Jun. 2 President Ortega announced that members of his government and
his Honduran counterpart Manuel Zelaya's government are currently
working on an initiative to request funding, in the form of discounted
rates on the importation of oil and other petroleum derived products
from OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), to
invest in the agricultural sectors of the world's poorest countries
(including those countries involved in<br>
the World Bank's Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative) as
part of an<br>
effort to encourage food sovereignty in these countries. <br>
<br>
The
idea behind this initiative came from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
who, during a recent OPEC conference, insisted that a mechanism to
subsidize oil exports to the world's poorest countries must be found.
During a subsequent meeting between Chavez and Ortega it was agreed to
take the idea further and incorporate it into an initiative to increase
food security in the most impoverished regions of the world. Ortega and
Zelaya are in the process of contacting the governments of the poorest
countries of Latin America and Africa and representatives of
international organizations to consult their proposal. <br>
<br>
Grass-roots
rural workers organizations and cooperatives in Nicaragua welcome the
Sandinista government's agricultural policy priorities aimed at rapidly
increasing food production and boosting consumption among the country's
most vulnerable socio-economic sectors. But it is far from clear
whether the diplomats and officials who drafted the FAO Summit's final
declaration on June 5 will back initiatives like that of Presidents
Zelaya and Ortega. It remains to be seen how far US and European
governments will go to defend their corporate agribusiness interests in
the region against moves to consolidate Latin American integration
processes in defence of the region's peoples.<br>
