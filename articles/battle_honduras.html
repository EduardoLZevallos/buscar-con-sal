What happens in Honduras will be decisive for the future of all Latin
America. At stake is the chance of defeating the extreme right-wing
continental project to deny the impoverished majority in Latin America
meaningful political participation and a decent life. Whether in
government&nbsp; - as in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru and
Panama &#8211; or in recalcitrant, entrenched opposition as elsewhere in the
Americas, the continent's extreme right-wing elites are determined to
use Honduras as a laboratory for their continental project.<br>
      <br>
Under cover of the economic crisis they themselves created, the ruling
plutocrat elite in the United States has already engineered&nbsp; a
massive transfer of wealth in their favour. In addition they have
consolidated the country's financial sector in such a way as to
guarantee taxpayer bailouts for the feckless speculating rich for the
foreseeable future. So the US government views the threat of genuine
democracy in Honduras with horror. That is why Hillary Clinton
continually treats the criminal Honduran coup regime as if it were an
entity deserving equal treatment as the legitimate government of
Honduras led by Manuel Zelaya.<br>
      <br>
Here is Clinton talking at a press conference after her meeting on
Monday September 21st with US State Department catspaw Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias. Asked if she was warning the coup regime not to
attempt to harm President Zelaya, Clinton replied,&nbsp; &#8220;Well, we have
certainly communicated very directly our expectation that there will be
order and no provocation on either side. This is not just a one-sided
request. It goes to both sides. Both sides have supporters who need to
be restrained and careful in their actions in the days ahead.&#8221; (1)<br>
      <br>
Clinton's cruel hypocrisy is irrelevant. Her and President Obama's
studied now-you-see-it-now-you-don't cynicism in support of the coup
regime is not going to prevent the overwhelming popular rejection of
the illegitimate coup regime in Honduras from expressing itself. Just
before Clinton spoke, the coup regime had savagely attacked around 4000
peaceful demonstrators outside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa,
where Manuel Zelaya has taken refuge. That savagery and the resistance
to it effectively mean that both the spurious elections scheduled for
November 29th and the settlement proposed by Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias &#8211; the so called San Jos&eacute; Agreement &#8211; are now almost
completely irrelevant.<br>
      <br>
Despite the vicious assault against the non-violent protest at the
Brazilian embassy and despite the continuing massive deployment of
security forces, on Wednesday September 23rd, the resistance in
Honduras mobilized 150,000 people against the coup regime in the
Honduran capital Tegucigalpa. Across the country hundreds of thousands
of people demonstrated against the coup regime in favour of their
elected President Manuel Zelaya. Attempts by people to converge on the
capital were only thwarted by heavy militarization of all the main
highways leading to the capital.<br>
      <br>
The ruthless brutality of the violence used against&nbsp; protesters
has injured hundreds. Human rights organizations are unable to report
the full extent of casualties because most of those organizations are
based in Tegucigalpa. Very probably, well over a thousand people have
been detained throughout the country. The Committee for Defence of
Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) reckons that far more people have been
killed in the latest&nbsp; round of repression than the four or five
reported so far. Overall, since the coup took place on June 28th ,
unofficially, CODEH's director, Andres Pavon, reckons over 150 deaths
can be attributed to the security forces.<br>
      <br>
Bertha Caceres, a leader of the COPINH popular organizations and
indigenous peoples' council, describes the coup regime as &#8220;A
dictatorship for the 21st Century which maintains some characteristics
of the dictatorships of the '70s and '80s and offers new strategies so
as to appear to be democratic. But no one can doubt that one is dealing
with a dictatorship with an economic, political and military structure
that controls all the powers of State and whose objective is to strike
against the emancipatory processes in our continent.&#8221; (1)<br>
      <br>
In an interview for Tortilla con Sal two days before Manuel Zelaya's
return to Honduras, Salvador Zuniga, also of COPINH, and, like Bertha
Caceres, a leader of the National Resistance Front said:<br>
      <br>
&#8220;We think that a restitution (of Manuel Zelaya) under the terms of the
San Jos&eacute;&nbsp; Agreement is a possibility that is closing down
more and more and is becoming minimal. This is because the coup leaders
are so intransigent. And also because these coup leaders are involved
with the ultra-right in the United States, the ultra-right in
Venezuela, the US-Cuban ultra-right. Oligarchies in Latin America and
the rest of the world agree with those authoritarian projects and with
this coup d'etat.<br>
      <br>
The coup leaders are determined to deny the restitution of President
Zelaya. Their strength is in the weapons they use against the people,
the military weapons, military force, so as to impose themselves
despite a few measures taken by the international community. In the
case of the United States these are measures that are not even
lukewarm. They are extremely soft measures.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Asked what role President Zelaya should play once back in Honduras,
Zuniga argued that Zelaya should &#8220;directly, no longer support the
proposal for his reinstatement but a proposal that would mean change in
Honduras, a national Constituent Assembly that can deliver a new
constitution, an emancipatory project with the idea that he ought to
support that and to which he could bring a great deal.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Both Caceres and Zuniga argue that Honduras is a litmus test for the
chances of continuing progressive change in Latin America. Caceres said
of the coup regime, &#8220;What should worry us is that one is dealing with a
new trend that could be repeated at any time in any part of the
continent, and that is why it is fundamentally important to stop it.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Zuniga elaborates a bit more, &#8220;All progressive governments and all
peoples should be in solidarity with the Honduran people directly. I
say this because the repression is going to increase.&nbsp; A war is
approaching of the ultra right-wing coup supporters against the
Honduran people. They are already recruiting mercenaries in Colombia,
El Salvador, Venezuela, US-Cubans and others....and they are part of a
strategy of invasion and domination in such a way that progressive
governments ought to be aware that after this coup d'etat will come
other coups and that this is the moment to form a single bloc so as to
stop here in Honduras this escalation by the ultra right. And that can
be done by helping serious efforts towards emancipation which obviously
have to include defeating the coup regime.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
The corporate media deliberately under-report what is happening in
Honduras. And never report what leaders of resistance to the coup
regime, like Salvador Zuniga and Bertha Caceres or Juan Barahona and
Carlos H. Reyes, are saying. Even a leading intellectual like Noam
Chomsky said recently, after nearly three months of unprecedented
popular resistance in Honduras, &#8220;Central America is traumatized by the
Reagan terror. Not much is going on there.&#8221; (3)<br>
      <br>
In general, most reporting of the coup on Honduras has focused on the
figure of Manuel Zelaya rather than on the epic resistance struggle by
hundreds of thousands of Hondurans. Most analysis tends to focus on
shallow discussion of available options, like the completely irrelevant
elections, the dead-agreement-walking of San Jos&eacute;, or possible
further sanctions against the coup regime. But since President Zelaya's
return on Monday September 21st, what happens outside Honduras is being
shoved to the margins by events in the streets. <br>
      <br>
Resistance to the coup regime is now more intense and widespread than
ever. The organizers of the National Resistance Front against the coup
have difficulty as they struggle to keep up with the popular response
to the implacable repression deployed by the fascist coup regime
leaders. A large part of the resistance stems from a determination to
reinstate the constitutionally elected President, Manuel Zelaya. <br>
      <br>
But the greater part of the resistance is by now deeply committed to
holding a national Constituent Assembly come what may. Another leader
of the National Resistance Front, Margarita Murillo, confirmed the
views of Caceres and Zu&ntilde;iga, remarking on the day Manuel Zelaya
returned to Honduras &#8220;the coup leaders obliged us to unite with one
single objective. And that objective is to oppose the coup d'etat and
then go for a national Constituent Assembly.&#8221; (4)<br>
      <br>
Likewise, Honduran garifuna leader Miriam Miranda said in a recent
interview, "now more than ever the Honduran people is preparing to
install a national Constituent Assembly. That is the cry. That is the
objective. And that is the step we must take. And I think we have
earned that as Hondurans. The Honduran people has earned the right to
build a new process, a process of change, to generate a different
process of change in this country."(5)<br>
      <br>
The intransigent coup regime, backed up by the most reactionary
political forces in the Americas, will go to any lengths to prevent a
Constituent Assembly in Honduras. The precedents in Venezuela, Bolivia
and Ecuador have demonstrated that any Constituent Assembly will mean
far-reaching change threatening the power and privilege of the region's
corrupt oligarchies. But the popular resistance is unlikely to accept
anything less than the Constituent Assembly they have been calling for
since before the coup of June 28th.<br>
      <br>
As the country moves ever closer to general insurrection against the
illegitimate coup regime and the nightmare of outright civil war, the
issue of external intervention figures more openly and frequently in
discussions about likely outcomes. The example of Haiti haunts the
leaders of the popular resistance. There, five years after the coup
that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Brazilian and other
troops continue to occupy Haiti, acting effectively as imperialist
enforcers on behalf of local, regional and international corporate
elites. <br>
      <br>
Plenty of people in the Honduran resistance fear that the strategy of
the US government is to deliberately hold back from applying meaningful
sanctions against the coup regime so as to create the conditions for a
multilateral intervention. That intervention &#8211; possibly in the
framework&nbsp; of the controversial principle of Responsibility to
Protect - would very likely impose the terms of the San Jos&eacute;
Agreement which explicitly discards the option of a national
Constituent Assembly. That aside, it may be no exaggeration to argue
that the future of genuine participatory democracy in Latin America now
depends on the resilience of the popular resistance movement in
Honduras. <br>
