On January 14th Daniel Ortega's government officially launched the new
Social Housing Program which will be carried out in collaboration with
Nicaragua's private sector. The project is the result of over six
months of talks between relevant public institutions, representatives
of Nicaragua's private banks and the construction and urban development
sectors.<br>
      <br>
According to Presidential Economic Adviser, Bayardo Arce, the Social
Housing Program goes a long way towards tackling the financial, legal
and administrative obstacles which have for years prevented a
significant dent being made in the country's shockingly high housing
deficit.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's precarious housing situation<br>
      <br>
The 2005 Housing Census carried out during former president Enrique
Bola&ntilde;os' administration established the number of existing
housing
units in Nicaragua to be close to 1 million and identified a housing
deficit of approximately 400,000. This figure was established mainly by
taking into account cases of severe overcrowding and houses located in
high risk areas.<br>
      <br>
At the time NGOs specializing in housing issues in Nicaragua questioned
the housing census results and methodology claiming the extent of
housing related problems in the country had been underestimated given
that housing units in need of major infrastructural repairs and
improvements (for example houses made from inadequate construction
materials like plastic sheeting and bamboo), and therefore unfit for
human occupation, were included within the number of existing houses
rather than being taken into when calculating the housing deficit.<br>
      <br>
Additionally, according to the same organizations the overall housing
deficit grows by between 15,000 and 20,000 housing units each year.<br>
      <br>
Judith Silva, current President of the Public Housing Institute, INVUR
(the organization which is responsible for coordinating the recently
announced Social Housing Program) estimates the national housing
deficit at a little over 900,000. That figure, she says, is made up of
over 400,000 new housing units and roughly 500,000 existing housing
units in need of major infrastructural improvements.<br>
      <br>
New legislation creates foundation for national housing plan<br>
      <br>
After initially establishing the need to prioritize the reduction of
the country's housing deficit&nbsp; via the mass construction of social
housing, President Ortega's administration began work on the Social
Housing Law. This legislation, which was passed by the National
Assembly in April 2009, set the legal and practical foundations for the
development and implementation of a national social housing plan.<br>
      <br>
For example, among many other measures, the law created a publicly
owned land bank requiring local governments to identify areas suitable
for social housing developments which would be added to the national
land bank and designated exclusively for the development of social
housing
projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <br>
      <br>
Also as part of the Social Housing Law a body called the National
Social Housing Council was created which was assigned the task to
overcoming the administrative, financial and other obstacles preventing
private sector investment in social housing. This council, presided by
INVUR's Judith Silva, is made up of the heads of seven different state
institutions and six different private sector associations. <br>
      <br>
During a TV interview on January 13th, Roberto L&oacute;pez, President
of the
Social Security Institute (INSS) and key member of the National Social
Housing Council,&nbsp; spoke at length about the details of
government's Social Housing Project and the obstacles the authorities
have had to overcome to make the recent announcement possible.<br>
      <br>
This government has had to persuade the banks to make significant
changes<br>
      <br>
When the FSLN took power in 2007 "approximately 5% of the bank's credit
portfolio was set aside for mortgages. ... And the vast majority of
those mortgages were available only for houses worth more than
US$70,000," said L&oacute;pez. He goes on to explain that up until now
the
sort of mortgages offered by Nicaraguan banks have pay back periods of
ten or fifteen years and annual interest rates of 14 - 16%. Monthly
payments on this sort of mortgage are around US$500 or US$600 making
them completely inaccessible for the vast majority of Nicaraguan
families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Therefore the challenge for this government has been not only to
persuade banks to increase the percentage of loan portfolios set aside
for mortgages, reduce interest rates and increase payback periods, but
also to create the conditions so that banks are willing to provide
mortgages for social housing. (INVUR's definition of social housing
units measure between 36 and 60 square meters, include access to
running water and electricity, and have a value of&nbsp; US$30,000 or
less).<br>
      <br>
In order to get the banks to agree to these sort of conditions it has
been necessary for the INSS to take back a certain amount of control
over its own financial reserves (which are invested within the national
banking system). As part of an agreement between INSS and the four main
Nicaraguan banks (BDF, Bancentro, BAC and Banpro), INSS will invest
US$45 million (roughly 10% of the institute's financial reserves) in
the banks under the specific condition that the funds be made available
for social housing mortgages.<br>
      <br>
L&oacute;pez describes this new arrangement vis-a-vis INSS investments
as
representing "a radical change. ... Previously INSS deposited the money
in the national banking system but had no control over how the bank
managed that investment."<br>
      <br>
Now banks will provide worker friendly mortgages<br>
      <br>
The mortgages made available as part of this agreement will be
exclusively available for social housing and should be paid back over a
20 year period at 8% annual interest. The borrowers of this sort of
mortgage will be required to make monthly payments of roughly US$100.<br>
      <br>
Additionally, the government has committed to subsidizing the interest
rate on mortgages of less than US$20,000 which means the less
financially able families involved in the housing program will end up
paying interest rates as low as 5.5%. For this type of mortgage,
monthly payments will be reduced to US$70 or less, according to
L&oacute;pez. <br>
      <br>
Those likely to be most benefited by the Social Housing Project are
precisely the INSS affiliated workers whose monthly social security
payments create and maintain the Institute's financial reserves in the
first place given that these workers will have greater ease persuading
the banks of their pay back ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
A long term solution which will also help the national economy<br>
      <br>
All the different sectors represented on the National Social Housing
Council appear to agree that the Social Housing Project will contribute
significantly to the Nicaraguan economy's predicted recovery during
2010. Jos&eacute; Ad&aacute;n Aguerr&iacute;, president of the most
influential private
sector organization, COSEP, confirmed this opinion pointing out that
construction, which fell by 20% in 2009, is one of the most important
sectors in the Nicaraguan economy, especially from the point of view of
generating employment.<br>
      <br>
Like so many of the FSLN government's positive social and&nbsp;
economic policy reforms during the last three years, the Social Housing
Project is not the result of a noteworthy increase in available
resources but the application of political will inspired by a
commitment to change. By no means would it have been impossible for
INSS authorities under previous administrations to invest 10% of the
institution's financial reserves in a similar housing program, but
presumably the former authorities had no interest in doing so.<br>
      <br>
Of course, the concrete plans announced last week would have to
constitute only the beginning of a far reaching national housing plan
in order to come anywhere close to solving Nicaragua's housing
problems. The US$45 million put up by INSS would only cover 2250
mortgages for houses worth US$20,000. The banks have committed to
matching INSS' initial investment once the program gets going. But many
more resources will have to be found over the coming years to ensure
the continuity and expansion of the program. If those resources are
found, the project could well represent a feasible long term solution
to the lack of access to adequate housing for Nicaraguan workers.&nbsp;
