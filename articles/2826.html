<p>I don't know how to pronounce words, or how to make them meaningful and expressive.</p>

<p>What is happening in Palestine cannot be described in words, but the least I can say is that it is genocide and a clear policy of ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>Genocide and violations of international law :</p>

<p>The number of martyrs in the Gaza Strip since October 7 reached 3,785 martyrs and more than 12,000 wounded, as well as 74 martyrs from the West Bank and more than 1,300 wounded.</p>

<p>70% of the martyrs were children and women, and there are still more than 2,000 people under the rubble, and people are being rescued in primitive ways due to the lack of mechanisms to search for them, as the Gaza Strip has been living under siege for 17 years. The entry of basic materials for life has been prevented. So what is the situation? As for the mechanisms!</p>

<p>People are sleeping in the open because their homes were destroyed<br />
The spread of diseases due to the presence of bodies under the rubble, as ice cream refrigerators were used after the refrigerators for the dead in hospitals became insufficient, there is no clean water, insufficient food, and there is a risk of starvation among the people.</p>

<p>The Israeli occupation is bombing hospitals, and the last massacre occurred when the Israeli occupation bombed Al-Ahli Mamdani Hospital, more than 500 martyrs killed and hundreds of wounded.</p>

<p>Ambulances, which are protected according to international and humanitarian law, were bombed. More than 40 ambulances were targeted by insane bombing by Israeli occupation aircraft.</p>

<p>Civilians were targeted in their homes without warning, and entire families were killed and removed from the civil registry.</p>

<p>The Israeli occupation cut off water, electricity, and the Internet to the people of Gaza. There is also no medicine or medical supplies available, and diseases began to spread due to Israel’s use of internationally banned phosphorous bombs.</p>

<p>The Israeli occupation destroyed entire residential buildings and towers by the hundreds, and bombed agricultural lands, schools, and even UNRWA schools. More than a million people were displaced from northern Gaza, half of the population of the Gaza Strip, which numbered about 2 million, three hundred people, in an attempt to displace them to Sinai in Egypt.</p>

<p>"It has become clear that the issue is not only the elimination of the Palestinian resistance, but the goal is to eliminate the Palestinian people, starting with the Gaza Strip. This is thanks to USA support and some European countries for the occupying state".</p>

<p>Human stories of Gazans displace workers in the West Bank:</p>

<p>It is that the Israeli occupation arrested a large number of Gaza workers who were working in the Israeli labor market.</p>

<p>The displace workers were thrown at military checkpoints in the West Bank, where their number reached about 5,000, and the number may increase.</p>

<p>They were abandoned without food, shelter, water, or any humanitarian services</p>

<p>Committees were formed in various West Bank cities to prepare workers to provide shelter, food, water, mattresses and pillows for sleeping, and even work.</p>

<p>Some of these disworkers lost their children and families in the Gaza Strip.<br />
One of the workers started working in the Tarqumiya area in Hebron.</p>

<p>He decided to save some money to implant an in vitro fertilised baby. He only had one child, and he spent many years without having children.</p>

<p>He called his wife in Gaza to tell her about this. The shocking news was that his wife and son had been killed due to bombing by Israeli occupation aircraft.</p>

<p>One of the workers in Tarqumiya had his family killed, and the people in the village decided to set up a funeral home for him to alleviate his great affliction.</p>

<p>But the Israeli occupation soldiers stormed the funeral home, clashes occurred with the Israeli occupation soldiers, many of them were injured, and Gaza workers who were in the village were arrested.</p>

<p>Another story...<br />
Gaza displace workers who were accommodated in the vocational training center in the town of Halhul, north of Hebron. The town was stormed at night and all 26 workers were arrested.</p>

<p>One of the residents adjacent to the center went out of his house to explore what was happening outside and was surprised by the Israeli occupation soldiers who fired three bullets into his chest.<br />
He was martyred in the hospital.</p>

<p>In the West Bank, additional military reinforcements were sent from Israeli occupation soldiers, and the cities were separated from each other by erecting additional barriers and isolating them from each other, as well as isolating one city from its villages and cities, which made life impossible and people began to move on foot if they could to reach other areas.</p>

<p>The Israeli occupation arrests Palestinians every day in the West Bank:</p>

<p>Arrests are carried out every night, as the number of prisoners jumped from 5,300 prisoners before October 7 to more than 10,000 Palestinian prisoners living in extremely difficult humanitarian conditions, overcrowding in the Israeli occupation prisons, bad treatment, poor food, and beatings of prisoners.</p>

<p>There are families in Hebron in the heart of the city who cannot leave their homes because they are besieged and are not allowed to leave.</p>

<p>Additional checkpoints were added at its entrances, as the checkpoints and closed roads that existed in Hebron before October 7 were 111.</p>

<p>It is known that the heart of the city of Hebron has turned into a ghetto for Palestinian families due to the presence of Jewish colonies inside the heart of Hebron, guarded by 2,500 Israeli soldiers, and there are more than 60 military checkpoints in an area not exceeding one square kilometer in the heart of Hebron.</p>

<p>The unlimited support from the United States of America, and some Western countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy and others, has become clear that they are partners in the extermination of the Palestinian people, while we do not see this support with us from the governments of Arab and Islamic countries, many of which open embassies. For the Israeli colonial state, life was normal in Palestine, and the Israeli colonial state was friendly to them.</p>

<p>A human flood is required against the embassies of Israel and its partner countries, led by America, until their embassies are closed.</p>

<p>We are dying every moment and every day, and the values of humanity and international and humanitarian law have become meaningless and empty in the face of preserving our meeting. What is required are actions that rise to the torrent of Palestinian blood, death and genocide.</p>
