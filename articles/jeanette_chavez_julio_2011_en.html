            <br>
            TcS : Has ALBA increased employment in Nicaragua?<br>
            <br>
            Ministra Jeanette Ch&aacute;vez: The figures we have make us
            think that what has been happening in Nicaragua is that
            unemployment has fallen and that in general employment has
            been growing, most fundamentally for women.<br>
            <br>
            The ALBA projects have led tot he implementation of a series
            of economic and productive programmes that have had direct
            repercussions in the population, generating employment,
            creating jobs and we can mention for example the Productive
            Food Bonus also know in our country as Zero Hunger. This is
            a programme which has created employment for more 60,000
            rural women.<br>
            <br>
            We want to stress this because this programme has had an
            impact in rural areas and in the lives of&nbsp; rural women
            who had no kind of paid work and who today, thanks to this
            programme and the transfer of resources that has taken
            place, are women who are productive, increasing the
            country's wealth but above all bringing food and well being
            to rural families.<br>
            <br>
            And it has not just affected their own direct employment but
            also that of their families because the family shares in
            looking after the animals, in food production and its sale
            and so that is an example of what is taking place in
            relation to employment.<br>
            <br>
            I'd also say that in urban areas programmes like Zero Usury,
            which consist of micro-loans extended to women heads of
            households they can start a small business. And these were
            unemployed women who today in practice have paid work, have
            a small business and are feeding and creating well being for
            their families.<br>
            <br>
            Programmes like Housing with Dignity or Roofs for Houses
            with Dignity are programmes that speed up or more correctly
            generate activity in the country's economy because people
            look for someone to make that roof. Then people live in
            better conditions and if they are working from home they
            have better conditions to develop that work and also are in
            conditions with more dignity for their families.<br>
            <br>
            I think ALBA, really we should say the Peoples' ALBA, has
            brought only benefits to people in Nicaragua because as well
            as increasing employment for us it has given us dignity as
            human beings. We think and feel that our people are hard
            working and to the degree that these ALBA supported
            programmes are reaching them, people have access to work
            with dignity, that gives them dignity as people and also to
            their families.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : The impression is that ALBA has provoked a multiplier
            effect....<br>
            <br>
            Jeanette Ch&aacute;vez: To the extent that there is more
            production and investment &#8211; and the ALBA investment projects
            are fundamental &#8211; that has also made employment creation
            more dynamic.<br>
            <br>
            In Nicaragua, before we had these projects, there really
            were high unemployment levels. So to the extent that the
            ALBA programmes have been implemented along with programmes
            promoted by the government itself, then to that same extent
            unemployment levels have been falling and employment levels
            have been rising.<br>
            <br>
            Let me give you a statistic. We have clear figures that we
            get from the Nicaragan Institute for Information on
            Development which has precise data. In Nicaragua since 2007
            325,000 jobs have been created up until May this year.That's
            the figure we have. This means that the unemployment rate
            has fallen. But we can also say that formal salaried
            employment in Nicaragua of workers registered for social
            security has increased. <br>
            <br>
            In 2007, we had in Nicaragua 420,000 people paying social
            security contributions adn today we are talking about
            592,000. And that has to do with the productive dynamic, the
            generation of work and employment that the ALBA progammes
            have had in practice in Nicaragua. To give you another
            figure, we are exporting record amounts of meat, both as
            live cattle and in the form of special cuts that are being
            sent to Venezuela. <br>
            <br>
            And now we are talking about exporting chicken. That means
            we have making the economy more dynamic since we embarked on
            these ALBA programme and since Venezuela is purchasing far
            more exports from us.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : What impact will projects like the refinery and the
            agro-industrial projects have?<br>
            <br>
            Jeannette Ch&aacute;vez:The refinery called the Supreme Idea
            of Bolivar is going to be really important adn will very
            likely produce about 4000 direct jobs. And if we are talking
            about 4000 jobs directly we reckon we can multiply that by 5
            which means in terms of indirect employment we should reach
            around 20,000 secure jobs resulting from the installation
            and operation of the refinery.<br>
            <br>
            If we are look at the production from the agro-industrial
            sector, milk processing plants for example then currently we
            count more or less one million jobs in the rural economy.
            That means that as a result of these agro-industrial
            projects linked to the dairy or beef industry we could be
            talking about another 300,000 more jobs in rural areas
            linked to this type of project.<br>
            <br>
            That means that if at any given moment the open unemployment
            rate in Nicaragua is at around 6.5% or 7% we might be able
            to get that figure down to 2%. And the impact of that on
            people would be felt immediately. And that's what we're
            aiming at with the projects and programmes of this
            government.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : Do you think ALBA can be credited with helping the
            recovery of the cooperative sector?<br>
            <br>
            Jeanette Ch&aacute;vez: There's a very interesting figure to
            do with this. I've been directly involved with the
            cooperative movement. In 2007 when Comandante Ortega took
            office again, we found 8000 cooperatives registered in the
            Employment Ministry records. So one of the tasks we had to
            carry out was to confirm those records, how far they were
            accurate in practice or whether they were just artificial
            numbers and those cooperatives did not in fact exist.<br>
            <br>
            And we found to our great surprise that when we went to
            confirm if those cooperatives existed or not we discovered
            that only 1200 of those cooperatives still existed. Those
            8000 were what the Revolution had left in 1990 after having
            given the cooperative movement a significant boost. And with
            the establishment of neoliberal policies the cooperative
            movement was wiped out. It had been made to disappear
            through lack of credit and the loss of the land of the
            cooperatives' members.<br>
            <br>
            So at the end of 2007 with a new Cooperative Law, the
            Institute for the Development of Cooperatives was created,
            called INFOCOOP, and the Employment Ministry has a permanent
            presence in INFOCOOP with a seat on the executive board. We
            started with those 1200 cooperatives which were what really
            existed and at the close of 2010 we had 3,500 cooperatives
            up to date and fully legal.<br>
            <br>
            That gives you some idea of how in a process that has taken
            three years there has been a recovery and a newly
            invigorated energy in the cooperative movement, but most of
            all in the rural cooperative movement, in the agricultural
            cooperatives and of those 3500 cooperatives at least 330 are
            women's cooperatives. That gives you an idea of what the
            recovery of the cooperative movement has meant and the
            significance of the support that the ALBA programmes and the
            government programmes have been giving.<br>
            <br>
            The cooperative movement needs to recover once more what it
            was up until 1990, a powerful movement of small and medium
            sized producers working as partners in their cooperatives
            and especially the women's cooperatives involved in rural
            production, These are real figures, not invented ones. These
            are formally legalized cooperatives. And there have been
            very large cooperative assemblies. One can see concretely
            how the cooperative movement in this country is recovering.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : Do you have any general observations on the issue of
            employment in Nicaragua?<br>
            <br>
            Jeanette Ch&aacute;vez: We want to demystify what is being
            said about the issue of employment in Nicaragua, that
            employment is stagnant here: Because what the right wing
            economists insist on referring to is formal salaried
            employment. In Nicaragua, with an economy like ours based
            mainly on small and medium sized businesses, we are not only
            dealing with formal salaried employment which is being
            created by all the various projects, we are also dealing
            with what we call small working businesses.<br>
            <br>
            That is to say people working on their own account as a
            result of programmes being promoted by the government, small
            productive economic activities that are encouraging the
            small business capacity of our people and which people are
            developing so as to have an income and a way of improving
            their well being, what we refer to as the common good. That
            shared social responsibility where all of us, employers,
            workers and government are committed to building this
            revolutionary project in Nicaragua which our government of
            reconciliation and national unity is promoting.<br>
            <br>
            We are moving ahead. ALBA's help has been decisive for us.
            ALBA in practice is the waking up or our peoples and in
            Nicaragua that is being made a reality and that link to our
            Bolivarian sisters and brothers is decisive in enabling this
            leap forward so our people have a better future.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : Has ALBA had any effect on emigration?<br>
            <br>
            Jeannette Ch&aacute;vez: We do have some concrete signs
            showing us that in some sectors emigration is declining. In
            2007 among those going to Costa Rica to take part in the
            coffee sugar cane and melon harvest there, about 5000
            Nicaraguans visited the Employment Ministry so we could
            accompany them in the process of getting visas and safe
            conducts and getting contracts duly reviewed by the
            Employment Ministry.<br>
            <br>
            As we have made progress negotiating the minimum wage via
            the Minimum Wage Commission which the Employment Ministry
            heads, seeking to increase the minimum wage we've tried to
            ensure that progress on the minimum wage also benefits the
            minimum payments made to coffee harvesters <br>
            <br>
            One example is that at the start of 2007 the average minimum
            wage in Nicaragua was 1400 c&oacute;rdobas (tr. about US$68)
            By February 2011, the minimum wage in Nicaragua was 3000
            c&oacute;rdobas. In other words, we have more than doubled
            the minimum wage now. The same has happened in relation to
            the coffee harvest. We have worked persistently with the
            coffee workers. <br>
            <br>
            And the coffee workers were&nbsp; telling us in 2007, &#8220;I'm
            off to Costa Rica because they pay better than here in
            Nicaragua.&#8221; In Nicaragua in 2007 the measure of coffee
            picked for export was US$0.57 cents. While in Costa Rica it
            was US$1.20. <br>
            <br>
            So we began to work on increasing that minimum payment.
            Today, taking into account the value of the meals workers
            receive, the measure of export coffee iN Nicaragua is paid
            at US$1.52 and in Costa Rica at US$1.50. So a moment arrived
            in which our minimum wage policy has given us results and
            encouraged workers not to head off to Costa Rica but to stay
            picking coffee in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            We visited coffee plantations last December and were talking
            to producers who told us that they no longer have problems
            recruiting labour. Instead, they now have more than enough
            labour which means pickers have decided to stay in Nicaragua
            rather than go to Costa Rica. And the pickers have told us
            they prefer to stay in Nicaragua than go to Costa Rica to
            work as emigrants.<br>
            <br>
            There will always be emigration for various reasons.
            Sometimes out of custom, sometimes because people have
            relatives in other countries. But I think the economic and
            employment policies the government is promoting have in
            general improved our workers' situation. And we have
            concrete proof of that in examples like that of the coffee
            workers which I have mentioned.<br>
