<p><strong>Address by Daniel</strong><br />
<br />
Good afternoon, Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters, families of Nicaragua, Venezuelan Brothers and Sisters, families of Venezuela, Nicaragua and Venezuela are one Big Family, we are Sisters and Brothers, and none us will ever sell out or surrender!</p>

<p>He was born one day, in a village, he was born in a humble village, Sabaneta is the name of the town where our Brother Hugo Chávez was born; he was born on July 28th 1954, and today we are commemorating his Birth, but we are also commemorating another Year of his Life, because Heroes never die, they always live on, they always fight on.</p>

<p>And, having known Comandante Hugo Chávez, from the very first moment I sensed in him firmness, tenderness and a Heart as great, as big, as good, as that of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and I would say that on that day, on this day, a Saint was born in Venezuela. Not for nothing did he invoke Christ, not for nothing did he have faith in Christ; Christ, the Greatest Hero Mankind has ever had.</p>

<p>Today we embrace the Fraternal Bolivarian People, we embrace President Nicolás Maduro Moros, who has been able to carry the Sword onward, has been able to defend Venezuela, and has been able to achieve great Victories, like the Victories they achieved yesterday.</p>

<p>An Extraordinary Victory!</p>

<p>In a vote where there were no disputes, no lawsuits, where the Venezuelan people, the Venezuelan Workers, Venezuela’s Peasants, Venezuela’s Youth participated, in a format that was established to give them all the right, both very young men and women, as well as adults, to cast their vote.</p>

<p>And when you cast your vote to say, as they certainly did say, I cast my vote for more Schools, I cast my vote for more hospitals, I cast my vote for more university education; I cast my vote so that we can have more employment. That is to say, by depositing that vote they are showing their will, they are not asking for gifts, they are asking for Public Works, Schools, Hospitals, Health Centers, to serve the Venezuelan People.</p>

<p>And it was an extraordinary vote where they also won many municipal authorities. The Opposition was left with a reduced number of municipal authorities, their share was reduced, before, the Opposition had a few more municipal authorities, but with yesterday's vote they lost some municipal authorities, and the Venezuelan People, Venezuela’s Workers, Hugo Chávez, Eternal Comandante, achieved a New Great Victory.</p>

<p>And these are victories you have to work hard to achieve, you have to have Heart, you have to have Soul, you have to have Strength, and that Heart, that Soul, that Strength is indeed held by Venezuela’s Youth and the Venezuelan People, just like Nicaragua’s Youth and  Nicaragua’s People.</p>

<p>These are Extraordinary Victories, because they are affirming, asserting the Process of Liberation, the Revolutionary Process, not only in the Sister Republic of Venezuela, but also in all of Our America. Because, even though we have enemies all over Our America, enemies to the death, enemies who would like to drop atomic bombs on us, who would like to destroy us, simply because we want to be sovereign, because we want to be independent, this Victory in Venezuela is a great defeat for the Imperialists of the Earth.</p>

<p>And it raises the morale of those Peoples in struggle, those Peoples who are oppressed, the morale of those Peoples who are threatened, Peoples who are extorted and blackmailed; the morale of the thousands of emigrants that the so called democrats, because they call themselves democrats, the Yankees call themselves democrats, thinking they are the kings of democracy...</p>

<p>How did the Yankees get to the United States? The Yankees did not exist before, those who were in those American lands were indigenous peoples, just like the indigenous peoples we had throughout our America before the invaders, the Imperialists, arrived to murder, to steal, to kill.</p>

<p>And the Europeans arrived, the English arrived, the French arrived, and they all set out looking for how to take over territory in North America that wasn’t theirs, it was the Caciques and their Indigenous Peoples who had been born there, who had grown up there, who lived there, who survived there, in difficult conditions, but they survived.</p>

<p>Suddenly the invaders appear with armaments, with ships, just as the Spaniards came to invade our lands here, and they decided that they are the owners of those North American lands, lands that belong to the indigenous Peoples, and those lands, let the President of the United States not forget where he comes from... He is not native to there! He has no Indian blood! He didn't own an inch of land! There in the United States, in those territories, the owners of the land were the Indigenous people.</p>

<p>And they arrived, they seized, they murdered, and now it turns out that they have become owners of that territory that never belonged to them, and since that territory does not belong to them, that territory, let us all trust in God, that it will one day return to the hands of its true Owners: The North American Indians!</p>

<p>You see, they arrived as invaders, or they arrived as those people from Latin America who go to the United States are now called. What do they call us? Emigrants. But they gave themselves the right not only to emigrate, well, it would have been different if the English and the French had arrived there, as emigrants, to buy land, but not to take over by force the lands of the Indigenous people, not to murder North American indigenous tribes.</p>

<p>If they had arrived in Peace, if they have come instead to help, to build houses, to improve the living conditions of the North American Indians, no one would have the negative opinion humanity has now of those Powers who simply take over, make their own, in that way, what is not theirs. And anyone who takes something that is not theirs is called a thief... They are thieves! Thieves!</p>

<p>The day of rebellion is coming in the United States. It is coming. Because they felt they had the right to come to the United States, to take over the United States, but if a Latin American, if a Nicaraguan, if a Venezuelan, wants to go there to the United States seeking work, better living conditions, now no longer, no longer, that’s not allowed any more.</p>

<p>Even if they have made a family there in the United States, even if they have children born in the United States, what do the thieves of those American lands do? They expel them, they put them in prison. They put mothers in prisons, simply because they are not white, simply because they were not born in the United States, because they were not born white.</p>

<p>Because there are also cases of US citizens people born in the United States but because their skin is a little brown or a little black, they stop being from the US. Why? Because what is bearing down on the world right now, the biggest threat to the World, is Fascism, Racism, which is regaining strength. And so, if you're not white, you're not human, you're meant to be a slave.</p>

<p>Fascism is the biggest threat that the world has at the moment, promoting wars, massacres... Palestine! They are destroying an entire people, the Palestinian People, simply because the ruling class of Israel, I do not blame the People of Israel, it is the rulers of Israel who, in collusion with the Yankee ruling class and the European ruling class, want to take over that entire Region because it has a lot of wealth, there is a lot of wealth.</p>

<p>They want to take over the Region, occupy it, they want to disappear the Peoples who need to disappear, as they want the Palestinian People to disappear, but they are not going to achieve it! They're not going to get their way! Because the Peoples, even in the very worst circumstances, in the most difficult conditions of slavery, the world’s Peoples have in the end managed to break the chains and free themselves from their oppressors.</p>

<p>On this day a Saint was born, Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías is a Saint, he was born a Saint, he behaved like a Saint, with an immense Heart, bringing Benefits not only to his People, he was not selfish, but he brought Benefits to many Peoples, to many Nations, including Nicaragua. This we cannot forget.</p>

<p>He is the noblest Saint I have ever known, in the conversations we had, there was nothing of evil, there was nothing of hurting others. No! What he wanted was for us to unite and to help each other, and that Venezuela was willing to help in any way it could, so that the economies of the most impoverished countries in this Region could develop.</p>

<p>How many houses have you built there in Venezuela, Ambassador? How many did you build?... Five million houses, and Nicolas is still building there. That is to say, he set himself to get the People out of Poverty, to improve the living conditions of the People, to improve health conditions, to improve the conditions for study, to improve the conditions for vehicles to transit there in Venezuela. And we say to the Venezuelan people, we say to President Nicolás Maduro Moros: Onward, Brother, Onward!</p>

<p>Chavez had a great vision, and let's remember that dramatic night when although he was in difficult conditions, he was there, giving battle, he was in difficult health conditions, but he was fighting the battle, despite being in difficult health conditions, he was raising his arms, in the rain, in that Closing Electoral Event. These are the actions only Heroes, out of Love for their People, out of Love for their Principles, are capable of doing.</p>

<p>And what vision Chávez had, what vision, when that night he announced that if he were to depart, the person who should take his place is Nicolás Maduro Moros, and he said it with great conviction, with great confidence, because he had the instinct to search out where there is good, where there is badness, and to put to one side the bad; and go onward with the good.</p>

<p>And he, with that vision, said: Here, like that great guiding moon, Nicolás will be the President if he, Chávez, were to depart. And he was not mistaken, there is Nicolás giving Battle with the Venezuelan people, Battle against the Imperialists of the Earth, who want to take over Venezuela so as to steal Venezuela's oil, and who also conspire with Guyana to try to steal from Venezuela’s People, from Venezuelan territory, the great oil riches that exist there.</p>

<p>Even when there are Agreements blocking that, whereby they have to start negotiating, and then reach a final Agreement. But no! What the Yankees are doing is that setting out to contract for oil that does not belong to Guyana, and so they provoke incidents and they would like to provoke violence, war. But I am sure that President Nicolás Maduro has the Wisdom, he has the Patience, he has the Strength, he has the Faith such that the battle for Guyana's oil has already been won by Venezuela and Guyana has lost.</p>

<p>On this evening, our congratulations again, our greetings, and our embrace, to that Youth who participated and won those Elections... And also 285 out of 330 municipal authorities were won.</p>

<p>And amid all this, in all these battles they have been waging against the conspiracies and attempts to invade Venezuela, in all these battles they have been waging, now with these Youth Elections and the Municipal Elections, Victory has been possible, because the Sainthood of Comandante Hugo Chavez has accompanied all these battles. He never leaves them on their own!</p>

<p>Chavez is one of those who, like Christ, who after being crucified rose again a few days later, and Chavez too is alive, he is risen, he is in all of us, he is in all of our Peoples.</p>

<p>Long live Comandante Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías!</p>

<p>Long live President Nicolás Maduro Moros!</p>

<p>Long live the People of Venezuela!</p>

<p>And long live this Date that remains in our Hearts, remains in our Soul, because it is the date on which a Saint was born: Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías!</p>

<p>Thank you, and see you soon.</p>
