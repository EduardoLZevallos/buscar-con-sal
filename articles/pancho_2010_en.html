direct democracy<br>
An interview with Francisco
Valenzuela, Mayor of Estelí<br>
      </span>Tortilla con Sal, 25 de febrero del 2010</span><br>

      <br>

Tortilla con Sal: For many years Estelí's local government has
had the reputation of being one of the most efficient and responsible
local governments in all of Nicaragua. Not long ago, during the
previous administration, the local authorities received a formal
acknowledgement confirming the truth of that reputation.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

Francisco Valenzuela: That's correct. <br>

      <br>

TcS: One of the most innovative things about the FSLN government has
been the project of Citizen Power. As Mayor, do you think this
project is producing results?<br>

      <br>

FV: Today, in the morning, we took part in a meeting with several
Citizen Power representatives. During this meeting information was
provided about what the local government had done, the amounts that
had been invested, the different projects that had been developed
during 2009. <br>

      <br>

We studied the report from both a quantitative and qualitative
perspective. In quantitative terms, what we found was that we invested
more that we had anticipated. We
had foreseen investments of C$76 million but we actually invested C$90
million. And we were able to do that despite the economic crisis. We
have been negatively affected by that crisis, and yet we invested 17%
more than we had anticipated in the different projects we carried
out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

However, the most important improvement perceived was in terms
of the quality of local government operations, which has to do with
the change in our operating model. The change that has taken
place involved a move towards governing together with the people - the
promotion of the Citizen Power model in which it is the people that
make the decisions concerning public investment in the municipality. <br>

      <br>

We began the great participative Municipal Budget Consultation last
year. This process is not just about asking<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> people their opinion, but about the people deciding what specifically the local
government should prioritize based on projected income. And it is our
responsibility to respect the people's will.</span><br style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

      <br>

During previous years people were consulted about the budget, but then
the Municipal Council came along and made the final decisions regarding
what the money should actually be spent on. Now the consultation takes
place but it is not just about opinions, it is about decisions being
made at a grass roots level by the Councils and Cabinets of Citizen
Power. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

And it was as a result of this decision making process that Plan Techo,
the housing improvement project, was identified as a priority in
Estelí. Other priorities that were identified were the provision
of plots of land for families to build homes, repairs and
improvements to rural roads, improvements to water and sanitation
infrastructure. After these priorities were identified we worked out,
based on projected income, which projects would be carried out, which
projects were really at the top of the list of priorities.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

This process is a real novelty, because the budget we inherited last
year was based on the previous model in which the Municipal Council was
the maximum authority. Now it is the people that choose how the local
government should operate. Now the Municipal Council administers and
carries out the projects decided on by the people. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

Like you said, Estelí has had a very positive experience in
terms of community organization dating back to the 1970s with the
Church base communities, which
organized civil defence, this was called the Civil Defence Council, and
it was about preparing for popular insurrection. <br>

      <br>

In Estelí there were three insurrections. This city has played a
very important role in recent Nicaraguan history. Estelí contributed
to the Sandinista Front many combatants who helped change the government, overthrowing the Somoza Dictatorship. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

All this history of community organization is still valid today but
it has been modernized, in view of the new
organizational reality in the country and the current socio-economic
conditions.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>
In the 80s we had the CDSs, the Sandinista Defence Committees, then in
the 90s the CDCs were formed, the Community Development Councils.
Today we have made the qualitative leap to the Councils of Citizen
Power. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

The Councils of Citizen Power, CPCs, are made up of 16 members of any
rural village or urban neighbourhood, each of whom is responsible for a
certain area of common concern health, education, environment,
culture, water, infrastructure, young people, the elderly etc.. They
represent their community before the
Cabinets of Citizen Power.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

So CPC members can come here and say to us - "look, we have such and
such a problem and we want you to help us resolve it," - it might be to
do with a road, or a housing issue, about electricity, about drinking
water, it might be about public security, or about environmental
protection or garbage collection. <br>

&nbsp;<br>
These areas of responsibility exist within the CPCs and have
counterparts both within the local government and central government
which means that they enjoy inter-institutional relationships. <br>

      <br>

So we have been working on the implementation of this new model.
Sharing power with the people means that the people also have
responsibilities. It is not just about allowing the people to impose
their will but also about assuming responsibilities via community
contributions to a locally beneficial project. These contributions do
not necessarily
need to be financial contributions but could be a contribution of
labour or a commitment to look after whatever is being built or
provided. <br>

      <br>

This is what we have been working on as part of this new model which is
practically fully implemented in this municipality. In the
municipality of Estelí, the area that we attend, the Citizen
Power model has become something normal. We are working within the
logic of Citizen Power, we participated in the Budget
Consultation, the budget was drafted and now we have to respect what
the people decided, we have to meet the people's demands as outlined in
the budget.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

This is the new operational method that we have been successfully
putting into practice. And I believe that we will continue to succeed
in terms of growing popular participation as people become more able
to
identify their roles, their responsibilities, their needs,
and as people become more able to use that awareness to actively
participate to improve their quality of life together with a Municipal
Government willing to support them, and, of course, a Central
Government
that fully welcomes its responsibility to support this process.
&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

TcS: Mayor Valenzuela, many political opponents in the country are very
critical of the CPCs. They say that the CPCs are a party mechanism.
What do you make of this sort of criticism?<br>

      <br>

FV: Those arguments are completely false. There is a tendency within
the right
wing opposition to manipulate the facts surrounding the CPCs in the
sense that they try to make out that the CPCs are part of the the FSLN's party structure. But there is no truth in that claim. <br>

      <br>

Logically it is the FSLN that promotes the CPCs. It is the FSLN
government that promotes this model. As Sandinistas we promote and
support this model. The make up of the CPCs, however, is politically
plural.&nbsp; There is a common denominator of all members of the CPCs
which is that they are citizens and that they perceive
different problems in their community. It is a result of the
community's ability to organize itself
that the local people are able to come together to work towards
solutions to their common problems. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

The FSLN has its own party structure, we have the Sandinista Leadership
Councils which are present at a grass roots level. These Leadership
Councils are the organic life of the party. We also have the Sandinista
Municipal Councils and the Sandinista Departmental Councils. The
different
party structures are separate from the CPCs.<br>

      <br>

The Cabinets of Citizen Power are community organizations. And of
course they have been attacked, they have been stigmatized, it has been
claimed that they form part of the FSLN structure. But that is not
true. They are citizen organizations and their function is to do with
solving existing problems in the local community.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

And, as we continue to develop the CPCs along the lines of this
logic, we have been able to overcome the stigma surrounding the new
model. There are many CPC leaders who belong to the Liberal Party, the
resistence party or some other party, but what they
want is for their road to be repaired, they want running water,&nbsp;
they want better garbage collection services. That's all. <br>

      <br>

And that is why, within the CPCs, we don't have an area of
responsibility focusing on propaganda, on political education, on
ideological aspects. Within the CPCs there are no formal political
discussions like the ones held within the party structures. The areas
of responsibility include things like the elderly and environmental
protection. These are not subject areas specific to any one
political party. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

The opposition has tried to make out that the CPCs are part of
the FSLN structure. But we haven't paid much attention to that attempt
to confuse things. We have worked hard in terms of making sure our
explanation about the reality of Citizen Power is made clear to
people. And, like I said, the model is being implemented. The
importance of this model is being established.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

TcS: Political criticism aside, such a profound change - the&nbsp;
implementation of&nbsp; a participative democracy - can't be an
easy process. I assume that you have encountered many organizational
and technical difficulties in the way of widening the scope of the
Citizen Power model. What are the greatest difficulties you have
encountered? <br>

      <br>

FV: Like you say, of course it is not easy to transform our operational
model. But we have been doing it step by step. The first step was the
government's promotion of the new model as a real necessity for the
nation. Then, after 2009, when we won 109 local governments out of
153 then we began the work of establishing the model.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

One of the difficulties we have encountered is in terms of the
acceptance that the CPCs and the Citizen Power Cabinets are not
subordinate to the municipal government nor to central government,
they are autonomous, and they have their own work dynamic. <br>

      <br>

A lot of the time it is tempting for the Mayor, or for the different
institutions, to treat the CPCs as subordinates. But that would be a
mistake. The CPCs and the institutions of government complement each
other's work. The government must make itself available to serve
the needs of the entire population. <br>

      <br>
So it is wrong for a mayor, a municipal council or some other
institution to act on this sort of temptation because the
people are capable of making their own decisions, of pointing things
out, of making criticisms or proposals. And it is very important that
the CPCs are sovereign, that they are not subordinate. The idea is
that they should be autonomous. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

But all this doesn't mean that the original concept of the CPCs didn't
come
from the Sandinistas. Of course it did. We are the ones promoting this
new model, we are the ones with vested interests in the implementation
of effective community organization, because only by organizing society
can we start to overcome problems. ...<br>

      <br>

Another problem might be a confusion
between the Sandinista Leadership Councils and the Councils of Citizen
Power. The Sandinista Leadership Councils that exist in different
institutions and in the neighbourhoods are the FSLN's grass roots
committees which represent the ideological base of our party. <br>

      <br>

So, often competition between the two might exist which might be a
fraternal sort of competition. Or the roles of the two might become
confused. In which case the opposition would take advantage of the
situation and say - "the CPCs are part of the FSLN." But that is not
correct. <br>

      <br>

We have reiterated many times, the CPCs are politically plural. The
only
prerequisite for members is to be a citizen, and to want to take part. <br>

      <br>

Another difficulty is to do with the potential tendency for the CPCs to
feel dependent on, or subordinate to the municipality and the
institutions. It shouldn't be like that, the CPCs, should make
themselves heards as a result of their own dynamic, as a result of
their autonomy.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

But I believe that these are problems that are being overcome. The CPCs
do have their own identity, they have their own operational dynamic.
They are progressing along the right path. <br>

      <br>

Now, the right wing media and opposition's attempt to stigmatize the
CPCs is borne from the fact that they see the new organizational
model as an enormous threat. Because, without doubt, the opposition
forces are very scared about the amount of power being placed in the
hands of ordinary people. They want all the power for themselves, they
want to be able to do what they like, to make themselves rich, to
exploit the people, to treat them like idiots, this is the undeniable
trend registered during Nicaragua's history. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

And with the Citizen Power model, what we are talking about is
effectively permitting the people to assume power. In other words, not
to limit democracy just to elections, to the right to vote, but to
create permanent democracy, to allow decision making, social audits, to
allow the people a real and effective voice. In other words to allow
the people to become active subjects within society and not passive
beings represented by unaccountable representatives. Because
representation is about the people handing over a blank cheque to their
mayor or their deputies - they elect you so that you can go and do
whatever you like. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

And it shouldn't be like that. Elected officials must be accountable.
We must act correctly, and that is made possible within a model
of direct democracy. <br>

      <br>

TcS: Talking with people from the different neighbourhoods and
communities of Estelí, a common complaint, and I think it is
legitimate to call it a complaint, is that they feel that there has not
been sufficient follow up in terms of training for members the CPCs. Do
you think this is a legitimate complaint?<br>

      <br>

FV: Yes, to a certain extent. That is one of the problems that exist.
We have tried to make the institutional counterparts to the
different areas of responsability in the CPCs as effective as possible.<br>

      <br>

For example, if you take a look at the CPCs in action, you will see
that the most effective area of responsibility is health. This is
mainly because they have such a competent and active counterpart in the
form of SILAIS, the Local System of Integral Healthcare Assistance.
The members of the CPCs responsible for health are, effectively,
volunteer support workers involved in an institutional work program. So
when there is an epidemic like 'flu, or when the mosquito population is
multiplied during the rainy season, then they have a specific role to
carry out with the support of an institution. So, really the health
representatives are the most effective, they are the most active.&nbsp;
&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

Another effective area is public security which has the police as their
counterparts. The CPCs carry out joint patrols with the police to
ensure the security in the community. <br>

      <br>

Another area that works well is the one to do with young people who are
involved with different institutions to promote sports and other
recreational activities in their local area.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

The areas that are less dynamic include infrastructure and the elderly. I think infrastructure is a bit passive. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

But definitely, with this model, great expectations have been created
and there is a lot of demand for services. And really, the demand
exceeds
the institutions' capacity to respond. So sometimes people start to
criticize, often because they have a history of being active, of being
belligerent. So what we want is to be as aware of the information as
possible so we can work out what we can do to help. <br>

      <br>

When thinking about what the community can contribute to any given
project, one should not think only along the lines of financial
contributions but about what the community can bring to the project -
how can we combine our work? How can we develop the project more
effectively taking into account initiatives from the local
people?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

And yes, I do believe that training is important, it is important for
roles to be discussed, and for a clear set of regulations regarding
CPC-government relations to exist. Because up until now, CPC members
are elected each year. But those annual elections haven't been
established in a formal way. And the people are asking for a more
formal outline of the CPC's functions. <br>

      <br>

So, as is natural in the construction of a new model, these sorts of
problems exist and are discussed, but in practise I think we are
working towards solutions. <br>

&nbsp;<br>

TcS: An important socio-political trend during the last ten or fifteen
years in Nicaragua has been the rapidly increasing presence and
influence of the non-governmental sector. Certain commentators suggest
that the CPC model is not looked on kindly by NGOs, because, like
the representatives of the oligarchy, they too consider the new model as a
threat to their influence. Can you mention any experiences that might
either support or undermine this analysis?<br>

      <br>

FV: Each NGO is different. In the case of Estelí we have very
good communication with the majority of the NGOs - many of them even work within the Citizen Power model.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>

For example - at least here in Estelí, I don't know if this is
the case in the rest of the country - but here INPRHU works together
with the local authorities on housing projects, road repair projects
and communal infrastructure projects. INPRHU communicates with the
community and carries out different coordinations through the members
of the CPCs. That is just one example but there are many.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>

At the same time, though, there are organizations, usually those that
work on political issues, whose actions are like those one would expect
from the political opposition. They seem to feel threatened by the
CPCs. And they are very negative about the Citizen Power model.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

These organizations call themselves, quote, civil society, unquote, and
their role is to attack the Citizen Power model, to attack this model
that promotes sharing responsibility and power with the population. It
is with those organizations that you will find the tendency you asked
about.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

But I wouldn't say that all NGOs have that attitude. I'd have to go
through the list one by one in order to say which are the NGOs working
in good faith and communicating well with the local authorities. <br>

      <br>

Yes, there have been a number of problems relating to the tendency you
mentioned, and not just in terms of each organization's work, but in
the sense that we are trying to make the use of all development funds
more transparent. We want to know what the funds are invested in and
what the role and function of each NGO is. <br>

      <br>

Very often development efforts are duplicated. Many times the resources
made available are not used in the best possible way due to a lack of
knowledge or because certain NGOs want to be protagonists, they want to
do what they do and not necessarily tell the authorities about their
work.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

We have always said that there are some lucky communities but also many
unlucky ones. There are certain communities that work with numerous
organizations and others that have never been benefited by an NGO
project. So, a lot of the time, that can create bad feeling between
communities. <br>

&nbsp;<br>

So we are trying to include in our investment plan, not just our own
municipal investment budget and the central government's budget for
Estelí, but also the budgets of all the different organizations
and programs presence in the municipality. We want to make development
aid and non-governmental influence more democratic.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

We also want to be able to identify where the greatest need is and
avoid the tendency for organizations and institutions to work in a
certain community just because it's convenient or to look for problems
as a way of earning a living. We want to be able to say - such and such
a problem exists in this community and so this program is going to that
community, and this other program is going to another community where
another specific problem exists. We want those kinds of decisions to be
based on a poverty and development map and on a publicly agreed
municipal strategy. We want to promote development that is equal,
balanced and fair.<br>

&nbsp;
      <br>

It is necessary for the non governmental sector to be more
transparent about their work, but sometimes they refuse to do that. A
lot of the time no one knows how much their budget is, or how much
staff are paid, how much money is invested and on what. I believe we
all need to work towards greater transparency, because development
investment in Estelí is enormous, but a lot of the time the
local authorities don't know whether funds are being used well or
whether relatively insignificant projects are being used to validate
very big budgets. And I don't think that situation is acceptable.&nbsp;
      <br>

      <br>

TcS: A final question. How do you evaluate the development of the
Citizen Power model? Are you optimistic? Do you feel confident that it
is developing in the right direction?<br>

      <br>

FV: I am very optimistic about it. I am a real fan of the Citizen Power
model. I have been to most parts of the country to promote it. In
Estelí the implementation of the model is pretty advanced, and,
I have on occasion sacrificed my presence here to visit other parts of
the country, because this is a national mission which I feel I have to
support.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

I am very optimistic about the model because people definitely feel
like active subjects within society, people propose things, there is
a sense of personal development. Nowadays&nbsp; some of the best
initiatives come from the poor neighbourhoods, from the rural
communities, and problems get solved.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

But, of course, the more organized people are, the more demand there is
and the more pressure there is. Because, if you don't allow people to
organize, if you only think about the people each time an election
comes round then you don't have to worry about much, there won't be
that much pressure - but if people are organized then everyone demands
their rights, you get criticized, people say "hey, what happened about
our road? You haven't done anything about the river, about housing ...
!"&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

When I go to the football stadium kids come up to me and say, "hey, you
haven't done anything about the road, what happened?" But it's because
people are organized. If the people are passive, if they are isolated
by so much indirect democracy, then they're not going to say anything
to you. <br>

      <br>

So public officials need to be open to criticisms, and we need to put
all our effort into meeting people's demands. That is why I am
optimistic about this model. And I can say, that during different acts,
lobbies and meetings I have been blown away by the extent of popular
participation. <br>

      <br>

Now, of course the right wing media and other opposition forces are
going to treat the CPCs as their enemies, and they will go on repeating
their manipulations until a number of people actually believe them. <br>

      <br>

But really, we should feel proud of this model which is helping to
restitute the rights of all Nicaragua's citizens without taking into
account their political, ideological or religious views. This models
restitutes rights, it creates spaces.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>

And we know that there are members of the CPCs who aren't going to vote
for the FSLN. They are there because they want to overcome problems.
They are there because they want to express their opinions, they want
to have a say and help overcome different problems in their community. <br>

      <br>

Of course I see this model with optimism. And I think it is going to be
around for a while. We have to work hard, we have to convince people to
get involved. This ideological struggle is not easy, the struggle
against the right wing media isn't easy either, but we believe in our
arguments, and our secret weapon is our ability to talk to people
personally, and to carry on reiterating our version of what the CPCs
are all about. &nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>

I think that the expectations created are gradually being fulfilled as
the government works towards providing results for the people who need
it most. A lot of the time, the ones negatively affected by this model
are the ones who made a living from the elitist political system. <br>

      <br>

Here in Esteli, thousands of people have been benefited with the micro
credit program, Zero Usury. At the moment we are preparing to benefit
1,400 former members of the Resistence movement with the program Roof
Plan which provides a new roof for their homes. And during the the rest
of the year we will be investing C$20 million on roof and housing
improvements for 4,000 families in the municipality.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

We have worked on water projects, sanitation projects, we have
facilitated rural communities connection to the national grid, we have
worked to get people involved in the production bonus program - Zero
Hunger. 2,000 families have been benefitted with the Zero Hunger
program just in the municipality of Estelí. That's 2,000 cows.
We are talking about a large herd of cattle!&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;
      <br>

And for a rich person, a cow and a pig doesn't mean much, but it might
mean everything for a poor person, because it means they can eat and
they can produce. <br>

      <br>

But of course, a poor person doesn't necessarily feel able to go to the
radio and talk about this, or to get out and talk to people outside
their community about it. But from person to person this message is
comunicated.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>

The important thing is that people don't lose hope. For this reason, as
part of the new model, the people don't just identify their prioritized
projects but they identify the people to be benefited, and the
beneficiaries should always be those most in need of support. But the
ones who aren't benefited at the start shouldn't lose hope because
with time everyone will be benefited in some way.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>
We don't want to be the ones to choose beneficiaries from our offices
in the government institutions, we want it to be the local people who
decide. And there are places where poor people who are not as badly off
as their neighbours need to make a sacrifice so their neighbours can
benefit. That is called solidarity and it happens a lot with
different projects. <br>

&nbsp;<br>

Learning to show solidarity means changing our attitude, it means not
putting one's personal interests first - it means giving a chance to
the people who need it most. <br>

      <br>

This is the basis of an enormous discussion going on in Nicaragua. We
are talking about changing the predominant attitude, which is not
something that's easy because we all live in this world where we are
encouraged just to think about ourselves, we are encouraged to be
selfish, we are penetrated by a sectarian, save-yourself-if-you-can
mentality. These are ills that we are exposed to.<br>

      <br>

And in order to transform this country we have to change our attitudes
starting at a grassroots level where the people are more receptive to
change. Because it is the poor people who are most willing to
contribute, they are the ones who are always willing to help whether
that involves helping to cook a communal meal or helping organize a
party. They are the ones that open their doors to each other. <br>

      <br>

The people who have most do things differently, they are elitist, they
have a different sort of life. But considering that the majority of
Nicaraguans are poor, the transformation process will be quicker. It
will be quick because, by nature, poor people show great
solidarity.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
