<h3><em><strong>Soros Once Crashed a Currency. Now His Network Is Betting on Progressive Chaos in America’s Biggest Cities to Create a Color Revolution That Takes Down the United States for Globalists </strong></em></h3>

<p>George Soros made his name in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12304907">1992 by betting against the British pound</a>, forcing the Bank of England to lose billions and leave the <span class="ZNx93QP1XNrBdT5MI6SY"><span class="expandableItem">European Exchange Rate Mechanism</span></span>. He saw weakness, funded the pressure points, and made $1 billion when the pound sterling collapsed. Now, at 94, he’s doing the same thing — not with money, but with US cities.</p>

<p>His project: Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old who just <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5597788/election-results-zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor">won New York City’s mayoral race</a> on November 4, 2025. Mamdani isn’t a real socialist. He’s an empty suit — a smooth-talking opportunist who says what the so-called Left wants to hear while being built by billionaire cash.</p>

<p>How did he win? <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/12/us-news/soros-funneled-37-million-to-lefty-groups-backing-mamdanis-mayoral-run/">Soros money</a>. Some estimates suggest that over<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15240093/Claim-Soros-charities-funneled-40m-support-Mamdani-rise-tax-scheme.html"> $40 million </a>flowed through <a href="https://whitecollarfraud.com/2025/10/28/how-soros-tax-exempt-syndicate-laundered-charitable-donations-into-political-support-and-ground-operations-for-mamdani/">nonprofits like Bend the Arc</a> and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/12/george-soros-funneled-37m-to-working-families-party-other-lefty-groups-backing-zohran-mamdani/">Working Families Party</a> to pay for door-knocking, TikTok ads, and rallies. It wasn’t grassroots — it was astroturf: fake people-power funded by tax-exempt foundations. One investigator filed <a href="https://whitecollarfraud.com/2025/09/30/from-soros-foundation-to-mamdanis-mayoral-campaign-following-the-money-through-the-circular-funding-machine/">11 IRS complaints</a> calling it a “money-laundering loop” for politics.</p>

<p>Mamdani promises rent freezes, free buses, and $30/hour wages — ideas that sound great on paper. But here’s the truth: These subsidies aren’t the core threat. Sudden, unmanaged population surges are the real poison — overwhelming infrastructure, services, and jobs without planning, leading to chaos, disinvestment, and exodus. The MTA’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2025-elections/new-york-city-mayor-results">$36 billion repair backlog</a> is bad enough, but dump millions of new residents into a system with no new housing, schools, hospitals, or transit capacity, and the city buckles.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what happened in the 1960s and ’70s: NYC’s population grew by over 800,000 in a decade from migration and births, but no one built the schools, hospitals, or housing to match. Welfare rolls exploded to <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/new-york-fiscal-crisis-1970s-migrants-welfare-costs">over 1 million by 1975</a>, straining a budget already bleeding from federal cuts and corruption. Crime spiked not because of who moved in, but because services collapsed under volume: understaffed police, overcrowded schools, and no jobs for the influx.</p>

<p>The Bronx burned — not from identity, but from infrastructure failure. Over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_South_Bronx_building_fires">30,000 fires in the 1970s</a>, many from arson by landlords cashing insurance on abandoned buildings after redlining and disinvestment. The city became the biggest slumlord overnight, taking <a href="https://jacobin.com/2019/08/decade-of-fire-film-south-bronx-nyc">tax-foreclosed properties</a> while closing firehouses and slashing services during the fiscal crisis.</p>

<p>Gangs filled the vacuum, poverty entrenched, and the middle class — of all backgrounds — fled to the suburbs. By 1975, NYC was on the brink of bankruptcy, bonds junk-rated, and President Ford’s infamous <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/new-york-fiscal-crisis-1970s-migrants-welfare-costs">Daily News headline read “Drop Dead”</a>. Mamdani’s vision ignores this: Subsidies without massive, planned infrastructure investment just accelerate the cycle, turning Gotham into a welfare trap that chases away taxpayers and invites more chaos.</p>

<p>He’s not a leader — he’s a project. His real job? Help Soros destabilize the US from the inside.<br />
 </p>

<p><b>This Is a Color Revolution — US Style</b></p>

<p>Soros didn’t “push” these revolutions himself. He funded the opposition parties and groups that did the dirty work:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Serbia (2000): Soros’s <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/colour_revolutions_3196jsp/">Open Society Foundations bankrolled Otpor!</a>, the youth opposition group that sparked protests against Milošević. They got millions for training, media, and rallies — turning anger into regime change.</li>
	<li>Georgia (2003): OSF poured <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/25/georgia.features11">$42 million in months</a> into opposition networks like Kmara and pro-Saakashvili parties, funding buses, TV ads, and fake roses for the crowds. Shevardnadze fell; a Soros-friendly leader rose.</li>
	<li>Ukraine (2004): <a href="https://vtforeignpolicy.com/2025/02/usaid-soros-secret-cash-cow-for-color-revolutions-and-natos-coup-in-ukraine-exclusive-dossier/">$14 million from U.S. aid via Soros-linked NGOs</a> went to opposition coalitions like Pora, paying for election monitors and youth camps that flipped the rigged vote.</li>
	<li>Kyrgyzstan (2005): OSF backed KelKel with scholarships and media gear; U.S. State Dept. funneled $12 million through Soros-linked groups for southern protests. Akaev fled; opposition formed the government.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pattern: Spot the crack (corrupt regime), fund the fighters (opposition parties/NGOs), let them “push” with protests and polls. Soros cashes in on the new order — open markets, Western ties, globalist access.</p>

<p>Now he’s doing it here. Mamdani is the project in NYC, with Soros cash arming “progressive” opposition to fracture what passes for the Democratic center. But let’s be clear: There’s no real Democratic center anymore. It’s been hollowed out by oligarchs like Soros, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/meet-former-soros-foundation-exec-connecting-obama-world-with-mamdani">who fund politicians</a> across the spectrum to maintain the illusion of a left-right divide. This divide-and-conquer tactic keeps the working class splintered — pitting union workers against new arrivals, city dwellers against rural folks, progressives against moderates — ensuring a united majority never forms to demand real planning: housing, schools, transit, and jobs in time to address population surges. The ’70s collapse wasn’t about who came in - it was about volume without vision, welfare without work, and services without scale. Mamdani’s subsidies without infrastructure are a recipe for the same.<br />
 </p>

<p><b>The Real Goal: Take Down America for Globalists</b></p>

<p>Soros and his allies don’t want strong cities or a strong country. They want:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Open borders without planning</li>
	<li>Weak policing without backup</li>
	<li>High taxes without services</li>
	<li>Businesses fleeing from chaos</li>
</ul>

<p>When cities collapse under unmanaged growth, the federal government steps in. That’s when globalist groups (<a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/report/the-globalist-elites-ideology-is-based-on-soross-vision-of-a-world-without-nations/">UN</a>, <a href="https://thedailybell.com/all-articles/news-analysis/anti-trump-us-color-revolution-includes-soros-and-clinton-purple-takeover/">Davos</a>, <a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/Color_revolution">World Economic Forum</a>) push for more control — erasing borders, centralizing power, turning the US into just another node in their one-world web. The ’70s proved it: Unplanned influxes strained welfare to breaking point (<a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/new-york-fiscal-crisis-1970s-migrants-welfare-costs">welfare rolls doubled in the 1960s</a>), services collapsed, crime soared, and flight followed — not from people, but from failure to scale.</p>

<p>Oligarchs exploited the chaos, lobbying for neoliberal tax cuts to starve services while grabbing incentives. Mamdani’s win isn’t about helping New Yorkers. It’s about breaking New York — so the globalists can rebuild it their way, with Soros-funded opposition leading the charge. And it works because the oligarchy — Soros, the Kochs, the Big Tech titans — pours billions into both parties. They fund Democrats like Mamdani to promise utopia without infrastructure, while funding Republicans to fearmonger without solutions, all while the working class fights over crumbs.</p>

<p>As Robert Reich has warned, this is democracy vs. oligarchy, not Left vs. Right: Oligarchs use the divide to loot the nation unchecked, ensuring the 99% stays fractured and powerless — just as unplanned growth in the ’70s turned the Bronx into a bonfire.<br />
 </p>

<p><strong>Democratic Socialists of America</strong><b>: Controlled Opposition, Not Revolution</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Socialists_of_America">DSA</a> isn’t a rebel army — it’s the Democratic Party’s safety valve. Founded in 1982, it’s always been about reform, not rupture. Bernie’s 2016 surge grew it to 90,000 members, but the core rule stays: run on the Democratic line, endorse Squad stars, then follow the party whip.</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/2023-national-convention-recap/">2023 Chicago convention</a>, delegates voted 704–184 to ban independent tickets — explicitly to “channel social discontent” without breaking the system. It’s a steam release: Let the Left scream about socialism, then funnel them into safe primaries where they lose or get absorbed. Critics like the World Socialist Web Site call it a “loyal appendage” of the Democrats, smothering real working-class revolt by tying it to the oligarch-funded machine. Reddit threads echo this: DSA is “controlled opposition within controlled opposition,” diluting dissent into donor-friendly drips. In the ’70s, similar “progressive” pushes for welfare expansion without infrastructure planning fueled the crisis, dividing the working class by pitting strained services against growing needs.</p>

<p>Mamdani? A perfect DSA product — dues-paying member turned mayoral mannequin. His “socialism” is a Soros-scripted illusion, designed to contain, not conquer. It keeps the working class chasing phantom heroes, divided by the very system it pretends to fight — subsidies are dangled as bait, while volume without vision erodes the foundations.<br />
 </p>

<p><b>Mamdani: The Empty Suit in Action</b></p>

<p>Born in Uganda to filmmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira_Nair">Mira Nair</a> and professor Mahmood Mamdani, Zohran Mamdani grew up in elite privilege — private schools, global travel, family wealth that could fund a small country. Yet he rails against “billionaires” from Brooklyn stages.</p>

<p>His platform? Vaporware that ignores history’s warnings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rent freezes - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/europe-zohran-mamdani-policies-normal">Landlord disinvestment and black-market sublets</a>, per ex-Rent Guidelines expert Leah Goodridge — echoing ’70s redlining that starved areas of investment when services failed.</li>
	<li>Free buses - A <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2025-elections/new-york-city-mayor-results">$1 billion annual hole</a> with no plan to fill it, while unmanaged growth swells ridership without revenue.</li>
	<li>City grocery stores - A bureaucratic flop copying failed European models, blind to how ’70s welfare bloat (<a href="https://jacobin.com/2017/07/new-york-fiscal-crisis-debt-municipal-politics-eisbonds-socialists">welfare costs tripled</a>) turned the city into a slumlord.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul said it best on MSNBC: No state money for this fantasy. He flip-flops on Israel: Condemns Hamas, calls Gaza a “genocide,” alienates Jews but keeps Soros-backed <a href="https://whitecollarfraud.com/2025/10/28/how-soros-tax-exempt-syndicate-laundered-charitable-donations-into-political-support-and-ground-operations-for-mamdani/">Bend the Arc</a> ($13M from OSF since 2016). It’s identity politics as performance — Muslim for Queens, “working-class” for millennials, anti-Trump for elites. All while oligarchs like Soros laugh, funding both sides to keep the working class at each other’s throats — just as ’70s volume without planning divided communities, sparking flight and fires.<br />
 </p>

<p><b>The Soros Playbook: From Abroad to Home</b></p>

<p>Soros’s <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society Foundations</a> has spent $25 billion since 1979 on “civil society.” In color revolutions, that means:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Train activists</li>
	<li>Fund media</li>
	<li>Rig the narrative</li>
	<li>Install the replacement</li>
</ol>

<p>In the U.S., it’s the same — just rebranded as “racial justice” or “climate action.” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/inside-mamdani-machine-soros-cash-socialists-radical-imams-engineered-zohran-mamdanis-path-power">OSF gave $33 million to BLM-linked groups</a> in 2020. Now? $1.4 billion in 2025 grants to opposition fronts, propping up the left-right charade that divides workers along cultural and ideological lines — much like how ’70s unplanned growth pitted strained services against growing needs, fueling resentment and exodus.</p>

<p>Alex Soros, the heir, celebrated Mamdani’s win with an <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/heir-billionaire-soros-fortune-cheers-180001843.html">X selfie</a>: “Proud New Yorker! American dream lives!” It’s the ultimate oligarch flex: Fund the fracture, watch the working class fight itself.<br />
 </p>

<p><b>What’s Next?</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>More Mamdani projects in Chicago, LA, Philly — opposition “heroes” bankrolled by <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">OSF grants</a>, deepening the divide with unmanaged inflows and soft-on-crime stances.</li>
	<li>More Soros cash disguised as “charity” to opposition fronts on both sides, echoing ’70s fiscal tricks that hid borrowing until bankruptcy loomed.</li>
	<li>More chaos — crime up, taxes up, services down, until the feds (or globalists) “save” us, further eroding the sovereignty of a united working class, just as the Bronx’s ’70s inferno left scars that took decades to heal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Trump called Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic.” He’s not wrong about the danger. Soros funds the opposition; they fix the revolution — all to keep the oligarchy’s divide-and-conquer alive, turning potential unity into endless flight.<br />
 </p>

<p><b>Bottom Line:</b></p>

<p>The 1970s crisis wasn’t about race, migration, or even welfare alone — it was mismanagement at scale. A city that grew too fast, spent too freely, and planned too little nearly defaulted on $14 billion. The lesson for 2025? Subsidies without infrastructure are just slow-motion bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Soros isn’t investing in progress. He’s shorting America — funding opposition to bet it will fail, propping up a fake left-right split that conquers a divided working class, subsidized dreams be damned when volume without planning overwhelms.</p>

<p>And Mamdani is his project, letting the “push” come from the streets he pays for — a repeat of the ’70s, where sudden surges without infrastructure burned the Bronx and broke the city.</p>

<p>If NYC falls, the dominoes start. This is how nations end — not with a bang, but with a funded protest, a billionaire’s check, and a working class too divided — by chaos from lack of planning — to fight back.</p>
