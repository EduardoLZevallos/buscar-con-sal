Housing
Deficit
:
One of the most shocking reminders of Nicaragua's
neoliberal past <br>
      </big> <br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">By Karla
Jacobs,</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">

      <br>
People in Nicaragua know all too well that the housing situation is one
of the problems
most felt by impoverished families in the country. At times it seems
like the population is made
up of families without houses, families who do not own the
land their houses are built on and families whose houses are so
deteriorated they may fall down at any moment. The
statistics confirm this is not too much of an exaggeration.<br>
      <small><br>
      </small>The IV Housing Census, carried out in 2005 during Enrique
Bolaños' administration,<big> </big><small><big>established a
total of 978,335 occupied houses in the country. Taking into account
cases of severe overcrowding and of houses built in high risk areas,
the same census identified a housing deficit of approximately 400,000.<big>&nbsp;
      </big><br>
      <br>
      </big></small>At the time NGOs specializing in housing issues in
Nicaragua questioned
the census results and methodology claiming the extent of
housing related problems in the country had been underestimated given
that, among other things, houses in need of major infrastructural
repairs and
improvements (for example houses made from inadequate construction
materials like plastic sheeting and bamboo), were included within the
number of existing houses
rather than being taken into&nbsp; account when calculating the housing
deficit.<big><br>
      </big><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicaragua has only one third of
the houses it needs</span><br>
      <br>
In 2008, Judith Silva, the current President of the Public Housing
Institute,
INVUR, estimated the national housing
deficit at a little over 900,000. That figure, she says, is made up of
over 400,000 new housing units and roughly 500,000 existing housing
units which require major infrastructural improvements to be
considered apt for human occupation.<br>
      <br>
In other words, of the just under one million houses identified by the
IV Housing Census in 2005, a little over half are unfit for human
occupation. Taking into account the need for a further 400,000 new
houses, one can conclude that Nicaragua only has a little over one
third
of the houses actually required by its population. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
On top of all this, the Chamber of Urban Developers of Nicaragua,
CADUR, estimates that each year Nicaraguan society produces another
15,000 to 20,000 new families unable to access their own
home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Keeping in mind the possibility of methodological flaws, let's take a
look at some of the most relevant and revealing statistics to have come
out of that 2005 IV Housing Census: <br>

There are certain departments and sectors of the country where the
percentage of houses legally registered in the owners' name is reduced
drastically. In rural Chinandega, for example, the census found that
only 30% of houses were
occupied by families whose ownership was adequately registered. &nbsp; <br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FSLN government demonstrates
commitment to improving housing situation</span><br>
      <br>
During the first three and a half years of the FSLN's Government of
Reconciliation and National Unity, several initiatives have emerged
demonstrating
the government's commitment to providing solutions to housing
related issues. These&nbsp; initiatives have taken three different
forms: <br>
      <br>
Firstly, cooperation funds, mainly from the Bolivarian Alliance for the
People of Our America (ALBA), have been used in large quantities for
different housing construction, repair and extension programs for
impoverished families. <br>
      <br>
Secondly, the government has made impressive progress in terms of the
legal registration of properties in the hands of Nicaraguan families. <small><br>
      <br>
      </small>Thirdly, public institutions have overseen administrative
efforts to create and implement an alliance between public and private
sectors which makes possible the prospect of mass construction of
social housing available to Nicaraguan workers via long
term, low interest rate mortgages. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Houses for the People," "A
Better House," "Roof Plan"</span><br>
      <br>
According to a <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/hannah/Documentos/articles/www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/6441">recent
report</a> published by the government in the context of the
celebrations marking the 31st Anniversary of the Popular Sandinista
Revolution, a total of 6,496 new houses have been built for the same
number of impoverished families in urban areas, while 3,585 houses,
also in urban areas, have been repaired or extended as part of the
government programs "Houses for the People" and "A Better House." Both
these programs are funded mainly by ALBA. <br>
      <br>
In rural areas the government's "Roof Plan," also financed by ALBA, has
benefited thousands of impoverished families. During the first
stage of the program, 60,000 campesino families across the country were
provided with corrugated iron and nails to extend or change the roofs
of their houses.<br>
      <br>
This program is coordinated by the Commission of Reconciliation, Peace
and Justice and the Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE). A few days
ago the President of FISE, <a href="http://www.el19digital.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15222&amp;Itemid=12">Nelson
Artola,
commented</a> that the government is now ready to launch the second
stage
of the "Roof Plan" as part of which a
further 64,300 campesino families will be benefited before the end of
the year.&nbsp;
&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Legalization of land ownership</span><br>
      <br>
Another of the programs which is having a positive impact on the
Nicaraguan population's housing situation is the Property Intendant's
Office's enormous effort to register the ownership of small and
large properties across the country.&nbsp; <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
As part of this initiative 69,286 property deeds have been provided to
the same number of families in
different departments of the country, according to the recent
government report referred to above.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Additionally, the government has marked out the limits and handed over
the deeds of communal land belonging to 214 mayagna, miskito and creole
indigenous communities in&nbsp; Nicaragua's Caribbean Coast regions.<small><big><br>
      </big><br>
      </small>The land marked out and registered in the names of these
communities represents a territorial expansion of
22,500 square kilometres, equivalent t<big><small>o</small> </big><small><big>17.25%
of
the
entirety
of Nicaragua's territory.</big><br>
      <br>
      <big>This acknowledgement of the ancestral rights of Nicaragua's
indigenous people has created legal security for the 103,790
inhabitants of the communities </big></small><small><big>benefited </big></small><small><big>.
      <br>
      </big></small><small><br>
      </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Housing Program
in alliance with the private sector</span><small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      </small>Of all the different government programs that form part
of the effort to improve the national housing situation, the
program which, without doubt, will have the greatest impact in the
medium and long term is the Social Housing Program, which was launched
by President Daniel Ortega in January of this year.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Like so many of the FSLN government's social and economic policy
reforms during the last three and a half years, the Social Housing
Program is not the result of a noteworthy increase in available
resources but the application of political will inspired by a
commitment to change. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><small><br>
      <br>
      </small>After initially establishing the need to prioritize the
reduction of
the country's housing deficit&nbsp; via the mass construction of social
housing, President Ortega's administration began work on a new Social
Housing Law. <br>
      <br>
This legislation, Law 677, which was passed by the National
Assembly in April 2009, "sets the legal and practical foundations for
the
development and implementation of a National Social Housing Plan by
committing State and private sector resources in the long
term," according to the recently published government report.<br>
      <br>
For example, among many other measures, Law 677 creates a publicly
owned land bank requiring local governments to identify areas suitable
for urban development to be designated exclusively for the development
of social
housing
projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
Also as part of the Social Housing Law a body called the National
Social Housing Council, presided over by
INVUR's Judith Silva, and made up of the heads of seven different state
institutions and six different private sector associations, was
created. The main task assigned to this Council is to overcome the
administrative, financial and other obstacles preventing
private sector investment in social housing. <br>
      <br>
(The Social Housing Law defines a social house as a house measuring
between 36 and 60 square metres, with access to running water and
electricity, valued at US$30,000 or less.)<br>
      <br>
This Council, in a very short space of time, has achieved the
implementation of several aspects of Law 677 including the
simplification of transactions regarding requests for permission to
build social housing projects (transactions which are overseen by
INVUR). Since January 2010, this has
facilitated,&nbsp; permission for 157 social housing projects
granted to the respective urban development companies in a record time
of 90 days or less.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Additionally, the Council has <small><big>secured important agreements
with the two main cement producing companies permitting a C$50 discount
on bags of cement (approximately a 30% discount) for social housing
projects. <br>
      </big><br>
      </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Only the rich could
access mortgages under the neoliberal system </span><small><br>
      <big><br>
The Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS) has played a key role
in the implementation of the Social Housing Program. During <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/es/node/5079">a TV
interview</a> with journalist Alberto Mora in January of this year, the
President of INSS, Roberto López, spoke in detail about the
different administrative and financial obstacles which </big></small><small><big>the
new
housing program </big></small><small><big>has overcome, and the
mechanisms created in
order to do so. </big><br>
      <big><br>
Among other things, López explained that when the FSLN came to
power in 2007 only 5% of </big></small>the country's banks' credit
portfolio was set aside for mortgages and that the vast majority of
the mortgages available were for houses worth over
US$70,000 with ten to fifteen year payback periods and 14 - 16% annual
interest. Monthly
payments on this sort of mortgage are around US$500 or US$600. &nbsp; <small><br>
      </small><small><big><br>
In other words, it was simply impossible for the immense majority of
the Nicaraguan population to get a mortgage. Today, as a result of the
Social Housing Program, the four main Nicaraguan banks (BDF, Bancentro,
BAC and Banpro) do offer mortgages with favourable conditions for
workers in formal employment.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
López explained that in order </big></small>get the banks to
agree to<small><big> off
mortgages for social housing, </big></small>it was necessary for INSS
to take back a certain amount of control
over its own financial reserves (which are invested within the national
banking system)<small><big>.</big></small> <br>
      <br>
As part of the Social Housing Program INSS conditioned
the investment of US$45 million (approximately 10% of the institution's
financial reserves) in the national banking system, <small><big>on the
banks' willingness to use those funds to provide formal sector workers
with mortgages for social housing. </big><br>
      <br>
      </small>López described this new arrangement vis-a-vis
INSS' financial reserves as "a radical change." Previously INSS
deposited its reserves in the national banking system but did not have
any control over the subsequent investments the banks made with that
money.&nbsp; <small><br>
      <br>
      </small>Also as part of the program, the banks committed to
doubling the initial US$45 million invested by INSS. This means that,
since January, US$90 million have been made available for social
housing mortgages in Nicaragua, something unprecedented in the
country's history. <small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now mortgages with
US$100 monthly payments are available </span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </small><small><big><br>
      </big> </small><small><big>According to the recent government
report mentioned above, almost US$16.7 million were disbursed by the
banks for the purchase of 1,230 social houses between January and July
2010. These mortgages have 20 year payback periods, 8% annual interest
and can be paid back in monthly payments of between US$100 - 130. <br>
      </big></small><small style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </small>Additionally, the government
has committed to subsidizing up to half of the interest on
mortgages for houses worth US$20,000 or less. For buyers with interest
rates subsidized by the government monthly payments on mortgages often
work out at less than US$100. <br>
      <br>
During <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/hannah/Documentos/articles/www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/6516">a
recent
interview</a> with the journalist Erwin Vega, the Vice President of
CADUR, Alberto Atha, spoke enthusiastically about the impact of the
Social Housing Program so far:&nbsp; <small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      <big>"[Right now] we are witnessing the lowest interest rates for
mortgages in the history of Nicaragua," says Atha. "Never before has it
been so easy to buy a house. Never before have there been such
favourable
financial conditions for home buyers." </big><br>
      </small><br>
"Compared to the 200 [social] houses that [the private sector] built
last year, [during the first semester of] this year, we have built
between 1,500 and 1750 houses. That is not much at all considering this
country's enormous housing deficit, but it is a lot more than last
year."<br>
      <small> </small><small><br>
      </small><a href="http://www.cosep.org.ni/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=516:monitoreo-de-noticias-empresariales-18-de-agosto-del-2010&amp;catid=45:monitoreo-de-medios&amp;Itemid=148">According
to
Atha</a>, soon the lowest price for social houses on the Nicaraguan
market will be reduced to US$10,000<small><big> thanks to an alliance
being forged between CADUR and the local governments to reduce the
price of land for social housing projects.&nbsp; </big></small><br>
      <br>
At present, those most able to access a mortgage for a social house
are precisely the INSS affiliated workers (the ones whose funds have
been made available to facilitate the program in the first place) given
that these workers are more able to convince the banks of their ability
to payment. <br>
      <br>
And for the moment, it looks like the different sectors involved are
confident that the number of houses sold to low income families will
experience a steady increase. "This is a new law," says Atha, "[we
expect to see] continuous progress."<br>
      <br>
      <small> </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The informal
sector requires other sorts of
housing programs</span><small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      <big>There are many sectors of society, however, sectors that
probably represent the majority of the population (campesinos, informal
sector workers, the unemployed) who are not able to access a
mortgage even under the favourable conditions that exist today. <br>
      <br>
These social sectors - the most impoverished families in the country -
are unable to access a mortgage not necessarily just because they don't
earn enough
income, but also because of their lack of formal employment. <br>
      </big></small><small> </small><small><br>
      <big>María Hernández' family's situation is similar
to </big></small><small><big>that of thousands of Nicaraguan families
who, for one reason or another, have found no alternative but to set up
home in improvised and highly marginalized settlements on land that
does not legally belong to them. The inhabitants of this sort of
settlement are the ones who took most of the weight of the neoliberal
system imposed on Nicaragua until recently.</big><br>
      </small><small><br>
      </small>María lives with her husband and their two
daughters in an annex of "La Primavera" neighbourhood in Managua called
"Las Viudas." Their house, which consists of one room four metres long
and two metres wide, is situated just a few meters from the
shores of Lake Xolotlán. <small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      </small>Legally the sector known as "Las Viudas" belongs to
Managua's local government. About 13 years ago, however, landless
families began
to set up home there. Subsequently some of
the families "sold" their plots to others. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"We want to legalize our
situation but we don't know how"</span><br>
      <small> </small><small><br>
      </small>María and her family have been living on the plot
of land they bought from the previous "owners" for 12 years. The walls
and the roof are made of rusty and broken strips of corrugated iron.
All the wooden beams that make up the structure of the house are
rotten.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
María's husband, Cristóbal Lanuza (75), is critically ill
with several different diseases including Parkinson's disease,
arthritis, gastritis and high blood pressure. He
can barely stand up or walk.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The family's financial situation is precarious given that none of the
family members is employed. Cristóbal, who worked all his life
as a builder, receives a pension from INSS for C$2,600 (US$120) a month
with which the family buys food and certain medicines
for Cristóbal which are not covered by the public health system. <small><br>
      </small><br>
"Our priority right now would be to change all the beams of the house,"
says María, although she recognizes that it is a contradiction
to
continue investing on land that does not belong to them. "We want to
legalize our situation but we don't know how to. We need a housing
project that adapts to our situation."&nbsp; <br>
      <small> <br>
      </small>María thinks it would be possible for the family
to put aside between C$300 or C$400 (US$14 to US$19) a month to payback
a
loan for the purchase of a plot of land should such an opportunity
exist. "Although we would have to limit our food intake a bit," she
says.&nbsp; <small><br>
      </small><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The land ownership and housing
situation in the countryside </span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </small><br>
In the countryside the situation regarding housing and land ownership
is similarly unfavourable for the poorest families. It is an unhappy
reality that after the example Nicaragua gave
the world with its Land Reform in the 1980s, today so many campesino
families are again landless. But, effectively, during the 16 years of
neoliberalism, Nicaraguan campesinos were converted back into
subordinates of the rich landowners. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/hannah/Documentos/articles/www.tortillaconsal.com/pedro_haslam.html">According
to
Pedro Haslam</a>, President of the Rural Development Institute, "more
than 50% of the land handed over to campesinos as part of the land
reform of the 80s was returned [to the landowning class]. It was either
sold back or
it was taken away from the campesinos. Different mechanisms were used,
but the
result was that the land did not remain in the hands of the campesino
families it was originally given to." <br>
      <br>
But as well as all the families benefited by the land reform who are
again landless today, one must also take into account the thousands of
young campesino families that have emerged over the last twenty years,
the vast majority of whom do not own even a small plot of land to build
a house on.&nbsp; <br>
      <small> </small><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Not one young family from my
community has been able to buy a plot of land"</span><br>
      <small><br>
      </small>Teresa Rayo (17) and Germán López (21) are
a young couple from two of the most remote communities of the
department of Estelí. Teresa is from Potrero Grande in the
municipality of Estelí and Germán is from San Marcos in
the municipality of San Nicolás. Both communities are situated
more than five hours walk from the nearest city (Estelí).<br>
      <small><br>
      </small>Teresa and Germán do not own any land, but, with
great sacrifice, they have been able to build a small house on the plot
of land owned by Teresa's grandmother. "We scrimped and saved and were
able to buy seven sheets of corrugated iron which was enough for half
the roof. The other half of the house is covered with plastic
sheeting," explains Teresa. "We invested a little more than C$2,000
(US$93) building the house." &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Because of the lack of work in Potrero Grande and the couple's lack of
land on which to grow crops, however, Teresa and Germán have felt
obliged to live and work on the farms of rich landowners, looking after
cattle and working the land in order to earn a little money.&nbsp; <small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      </small>"Our plan is to work as hard as we can so that one day we
can buy our own plot of land. We don't want to work on other people's
land all our lives, going from one farm to another, because that way
you can't work your way out of the situation you are in," says Teresa.
"If we had our own plot of land we could work hard and try to live a
little better." <br>
      <br>
According to the couple, the inaccessibility of land is a problem felt
by the entire younger generation in their communities: Germán
says he is not aware of any young family in San Marcos that has been
able to buy a plot of land to build a house on: "the only families that
have land to build on are those that inherited from their parents." <br>
      <small> </small><small><br>
      </small>In communities like San Marcos and Potrero Grande a
reasonable sized plot of land (roughly a third of an acre) costs
between C$12,000 and C$15,000 (between US$557 and US$696). Teresa and
Germán say that, were it possible to access a loan to buy a plot
of land, they could put aside C$500 (US$23) of the C$2,000 (US$93) they
earn for a monthly payment. (At present the minimum salary for
agricultural work is C$1,767.57 (US$82) a month.)&nbsp; <small><br>
      </small><br>
That means that, if they were given a loan for a plot of land worth
C$13,500 (US$627), they would be able to pay off the debt, plus 8%
annual interest, in less than three years.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Condemning the housing deficit
to the past</span><small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      </small>It is difficult to overestimate the importance of owning
a secure and dignified house in terms of a family's ability to achieve
well-being and happiness. Looked at from a national perspective, a
housing and land-ownership deficit that affects the majority of the
population represents an enormous obstacle on the path to the
development of society as a whole. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
To discuss these issues in Nicaragua is to touch one of the most
sensitive points of the national reality and one of the most shocking
reminders of the nation's neoliberal past. <small><br>
      </small><small><br>
      </small>During the last three and a half years the Government of
Reconciliation and National Unity has demonstrated its commitment to
resolve the problems related to the housing deficit in the country, and
we have already seen the first concrete results of that commitment. <small><br>
      </small><br>
It has also become clear, however, that there are many limiting factors
affecting the capacity, both of the government and of the people, to
resolve these problems in the short term.&nbsp; <br>
      <small><br>
      </small>It is clear that many more years will be needed before
Nicaragua can condemn this reminder of its neoliberal past to the
collective memory of the new nation. <small><br>
