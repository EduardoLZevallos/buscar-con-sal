GREEN PARTY PEACE ACTION COMMITTEE STATEMENTS - ON THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE, NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">On March 5th, the U.S. Green Peace Action Committee (GPAX) released statements regarding the situation in Ukraine. One is modeled after an anti-imperialist statement authored by the Black Alliance for Peace (BAP) which is located </font></font><a href="https://blackallianceforpeace.com/bapstatements/ukrainedecentereurope"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">here</font></a><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">. The other is focused on the looming and existential threat of nuclear war. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Unfortunately, GPAX’s statements fundamentally depart from the one issued on March 6</font></font><font color="#000000"><sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif">th</font></sup></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> by Michael O’Neil, the Green Party communications manager in </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>Greenline, a weekly newsletter of the Green Party of the United States</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">. O’Neil’s statement is not based on approval by the National Committee. Instead, its release is justified by a faulty claim that it follows the U.S. Green Party’s platform “pillar of non-violence”. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">However, O’Neil’s statement not only includes slogans that forward a neoliberal narrative that promotes war such as “Russian Troops Out”, but it also links to other provocative statements </font></font><a href="https://www.gp.org/green_party_calls_for_ceasefire_and_diplomatic_solution_to_ukraine_crisis?utm_campaign=greenline_22_03_06&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=gpus"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">here</font></a><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> that outrightly condemn Russia and offer no informative historical perspective. While Green anti-imperialist committee members find that these statements feed into the U.S. war propaganda against Russia, a sovereign nation, and that the U.S needs to look at itself to identify what it can do to de-escalate the situation, they were not surprised.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Trahern Crews from NIBC believes, "the U.S. Greens should focus on U.S. involvement in Ukraine and demand the U.S. de-escalate the threat of nuclear war. The Biden administration must immediately stop the funding and arming of the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion and keep NATO forces away from Russian borders.” </font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">For consideration, if the tables were turned, and Russia orchestrated a bloody coup in Mexico, installed a puppet president tied to Russian interests, continued to financially support and arm Mexican cartels (that killed 14,0000 Americans living in Mexico over an 8-year period), developed bioweapon labs, and then as a grand finale sought to develop nuclear weapons that could strike Washington, D.C. and other major U.S. cities within 7 minutes, would anyone question the need for the U.S. to provide a military response? </font></p>

<p><b>GPAX STATEMENTS ON THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Posted on March 5, 2022</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Statement on Western Imperialism and the Conflict in Ukraine</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The Green Party Peace Action Committee (GPAX) views the conflict in Ukraine as the tragic, yet inevitable, result of relentless effort by the U.S., NATO, and the European Union for global economic, political, and military dominance. Within this context, the current conflict stems from the 2014 US-backed coup of Ukraine’s democratically elected government – and in the determination of the U.S./EU/NATO to convert Ukraine, whose government recently stated its intention to acquire nuclear weapons, into a heavily militarized NATO member nation located on the border of the Russian Federation.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">NATO’s expansion has been a pressing security concern for Russia since 1998, when the U.S. govt. inaugurated the formal process of growing NATO’s membership to include former nations of the Warsaw Pact – Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. NATO expansion into Eastern Europe has been carried out, not only in violation of a pledge – made by Secretary of State James A. Baker to then-Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 – that NATO would not expand one inch eastward with the end of the Cold War, but also in violation of subsequent treaties in which the U.S. and its allies committed to respect the security concerns of other countries, including the Russian Federation.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Today, as the conflict escalates, NATO’s aggressive expansion has become an existential threat to all oppressed and colonized people around the world. A similar effort to expand is occurring in Latin America with the use of Colombia and Brazil as U.S. proxies against Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba. Also, in the African continent, regime change is enacted through AFRICOM funding and training. For peace to arrive in these regions and in the world, NATO and AFRICOM must be dismantled.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">For GPAX, peace is not merely the absence of conflict. Peace means a world liberated from militarism, nuclear proliferation, imperialism and unjust war, patriarchy, and white supremacy. The resurgence and celebration of Nazism in Ukraine, as well as in the West, demonstrates that the global consolidation of xenophobia and racism, especially white supremacy, is an integral part of imperialism.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">For GPAX, peace also means: dismantling the military-industrial complex and all intelligence agencies that engage in covert warfare &amp; that subject U.S. citizens to unconstitutional surveillance for “anti-government” views; nationalizing the oil &amp; gas industries that realize windfall profits from contrived world shortages (i.e. oil/gas from Iran, Venezuela and Russia are restricted); abolishing illegal unilateral economic sanctions that kill and cause untold suffering to the people of targeted countries; and nationalizing the Federal Reserve system – <a href="https://mronline.org/2020/03/10/united-states-imposed-economic-sanctions-the-big-heist/">that funnels stolen &amp; frozen foreign assets to select member banks</a> which misuse these illicit funds in the repurchasing market to realize extraordinary profit. Witness what’s happening with Afghanistan’s assets, more than 20 years after the U.S. first invaded.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The only way to end war is to end corporate profiteering!</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Bloated “defense” budgets must be reinvested into education, health and childcare, housing, and a people centered Green New Deal. While we grieve for the current loss of life in Ukraine, we also mourn over 14,000 deaths in Eastern Ukraine caused over eight years by the Ukrainian military armed heavily by the U.S. We also mourn hundreds of thousands of deaths in Somalia, Yemen, and in every nation suffering because of NATO provoked wars and armed conflicts. We offer our unwavering solidarity with all victims of imperialism.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">To secure the interests of the Russian and Ukrainian people, there must be good faith negotiations between the Russian Federation, representatives of the peoples of Donbas, and the Ukraine. The EU and the U.S. must end their continuous shipments of arms and other “lethal aid” to Ukraine. The 2015 Minsk agreements, signed by both Ukraine and Russia and the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, and approved by the UN Security Council in 2015, offer one formula for a diplomatic solution to the conflict that would satisfy the aspirations of the peoples of the Donbass for autonomy from the current Ukrainian government.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">It was only after the Ukrainian government’s shelling of Eastern Ukraine, in violation of the Minsk agreement – which was confirmed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – that Russia, in mid-February, withdrew its support. The conflict in Ukraine has exposed the destructive effects of imperialism: war, racism, and militarism, which continually result in the unjust and anti-democratic redistribution &amp; concentration of capital. Our demand for peace requires an end to U.S. imperialism and its implementation by NATO and other U.S. military alliances.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>The United States Is Stumbling Toward Nuclear War</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The most important and troubling fact of the current war in Ukraine is that the U.S. is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia. Our foreign policy establishment has maneuvered the U.S. into a position of direct confrontation with Russia, the most heavily armed nuclear power. The United States has the second largest nuclear armament. To support the Ukrainian government, the U.S. has effectively declared economic war on Russia, and we are supplying lethal military aid to Ukraine to be used on the battlefield against Russia. We are urging other countries, like Germany, to do the same. How did we get to this precarious situation?</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Over the last two decades, U.S. foreign policy has been dominated by militaristic thinking. The use of military power through aggressive war and the threat of military action has been a means of asserting U.S. influence in international affairs. This approach has been unsuccessful, to say the least. Now the same policy makers who created the disasters in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria are urging similar militaristic adventures directed against Russia and China. But Russia and China are not militarily weak and vulnerable states like the past victims of U.S. aggression. They are nuclear armed, and there is no defense against nuclear weapons. Once a nuclear war begins, the whole world will be impacted!</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The American people are now asked to trust the judgment of a Washington power elite with a record of repeated disastrous miscalculation as it urges increasing hostility toward Russia and China. Errors of judgment in Iraq and Afghanistan led to death and destruction in distant lands, but similar errors in dealing with Russia and China could lead to the nuclear destruction of cities in the United States and around the world..</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The Peace Action Committee of the Green Party of the U.S. calls for ending America’s militaristic foreign policy, beginning with advocacy of a negotiated settlement of the war in Ukraine. The U.S., which has enormous influence over the Zelensky government, and has interfered greatly in Ukraine’s affairs at least since the coup of 2014, is currently acting to prolong the armed struggle. Sacrificing the lives of thousands of Ukrainians in a futile struggle against an overwhelming invasion force is an irresponsible action. A neutral Ukraine can coexist peacefully with Russia, just as Finland and Austria have since the end of WWII.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Keeping the U.S. on the brink of nuclear war with Russia and China by sustaining and aggravating regional disputes risks world-wide catastrophe. We must prevent the U.S. policy of unending war fever from becoming a fatal affliction for all humankind. All countries in the world deserve to live in peace and security.</font></p>

Thus, our foreign policy of attacking, through overt and covert warfare, the sovereignty of nation-states to acquire their <a href="https://youtu.be/Ayi34PYpDCY">natural</a>, financial, and human resources to maintain geopolitical supremacy must end if we are to protect ourselves and the people of the world against the corporate hijacking of our foreign policy.

Economic sanctions negatively impact <a href="https://mronline.org/2020/03/10/united-states-imposed-economic-sanctions-the-big-heist/">one-third of humanity in 39 countries</a> and cause death and devastation by denying targeted countries access to U.S. dominated markets, finance, and transactional systems. Additionally, our government uses secondary sanctions to force third parties, such as foreign governments, financial institutions, and individuals, to adopt U.S. sanctions against targeted countries. Penalties for conducting business with a sanctioned country range from military aggression, arrest, fines, and property seizures to being cut off from the US financial system and markets – whether or not the activity engaged in impacts the United States directly. Thus, economic sanctions restrict a targeted country from generating wealth, stabilizing its currency against price fluctuations, and providing its people with critical services and resources. Because economic sanctions also interfere with the functioning of essential infrastructure, e.g. electrical grids, transportation and communication systems, and water treatment &amp; distribution facilities, by blocking access to key industrial inputs, such as fuel, raw materials, and replacement parts, they lead to drought, famine, disease, and abject poverty.</font></p>

Yet, sanctions are slyly marketed by our government as a “more peaceful way to make the world safe for democracy.” This lie allows the United States to implement, with impunity, economic sanctions that devastate the most vulnerable people in the countries it hypocritically claims it’s seeking to protect. Economic sanctions are also used to justify and conceal the appropriation of foreign public funds by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve through asset freezes and seizures.</font></p>
