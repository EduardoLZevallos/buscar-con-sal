Nicaragua's municipal elections held on November 9th, the international
media launched a barrage of attacks on the country's institutions,
targeting in particular the country's electoral authority. In reports
from "The Economist" and from journalists like John Carlin in "The
Independent", blatant ignorance of Nicaragua's current affairs
compounded those corporate media's customary prejudice against
left-wing governments in Latin America. The reports were based on false
accounts of the election process and its aftermath. For example both
"The Economist" report and John Carlin's in "The Independent" claimed
there were no international election observers. But there were. On
November 25th Tortilla con Sal spoke to Roberto Rivas, President of
Nicaragua's electoral authority - which in Nicaragua is a power
independent of the legislature, the executive or the judiciary. In this
interview he refutes the false accusations published and broadcast in
the international corporate media.</span><br><br>TcS : Now the
elections of November 9th are over and there has been much controversy
with many criticisms, some specific, some more general. Can we talk
about some of the specific criticisms? For example people like Julio
López Campos&nbsp; or Monica Baltodano argue that the Consejo Supremo
Electoral should not have issued preliminary results via percentages of
votes cast, but rather the actual numbers of votes with the numbers of
spoiled votes and also the number of abstentions. What do you think of
that argument?<br><br>RR : It's a question of methodology. While it's
true that the law talks about presenting the votes in absolute numbers,
it also talks about three types of publication: preliminary provisional
results with the transmission of tally sheets still to be resolved and
without differentiating the voting stations where formal complaints
have been made; provisional results with the formal complaints resolved
and with the consolidated results from the departments; and the
definitive results with the proclamation of elected officials and any
formal complaints made to the Supreme Electoral Council resolved. We
have given the preliminary provisional results in percentages because
it is a very easy way for people in Nicaragua to understand and they
are the ones who vote and who are interested in whom they have elected.
If you tell people absolute numbers in a direct television
transmission, the votes in numbers, it is difficult for them to
identify who is leading the election, who is in second place and who is
in third place. That has been just a matter of methodology, not that
the numbers were not available.<br><br>In any case, my answer is quite
concrete. In the publication of the provisional results in a medium of
mass communication as prescribed by law, which was done in El Nuevo
Diario (tr. a national daily newspaper), the absolute numbers appear
just as they were presented. The spoiled votes will be presented in the
Supreme Electoral Council's memorandum which has to be done after each
election process.<br><br>TcS : Another question that has been raised
after the elections is that the news media had many apparently
contradictory reports as regards formal electoral complaints. Some
reports gave the impression that some formal complaints had been made,
for example in Leon. Then other reports appeared giving the impression
that no formal complaints had been lodged. Can you comment on the issue
of formal election complaints and whether or not any were lodged?<br><br>RR
: Our system is very simple. In the voting stations there are four
causes for formal complaints once the count in the voting station has
been closed. I'll mention two of these causes for formal complaint. One
is incorrect constitution of the voting station, another is through a
change in the location of the junta and there are another two causes
that have to do with the alteration of documentation and handing over
results outside the time prescribed by law. That formal complaint is
dealt with in the Departmental Electoral Council, in the case of León
in the Departmental Electoral Council of León. In the case of Managua
then in the Departmental Electoral Council of Managua. Faced with that
resolution the political parties can then present an appeal for review
to the Supreme Electoral Council which is the ultimate tribunal to
which they can appeal. There is no other tribunal.<br><br>What tends to
happen in Nicaragua as regards formal election complaints? There are
very few. Despite the fact that they could be a way that political
parties might use to cause confusion in an electoral process, they make
little use of them. They do not use them as a means or a method to
cause disorder in an election process. And in the case of León there
are not enough formal complaints, whether they may be resolved for or
against, to change the election results, And that is of the highest
importance.<br><br>There are two main parameters. One is that the
number of spoiled votes should never mean more than the difference
between first and second place. And secondly, that the votes lost
through any formal complaints should not mean a candidate wins or
loses. But if those formal complaints comply with the law, are well
founded and abide by the legal requirements, then it doesn't matter.
And that may change a result, since the formal complaints are simply
accepted such as they are and in the cases that come before us, we
check them to see if they are in order and if so, give them our
approval. <br><br>TcS : And what was the situation in Managua? Because
Eduardo Montealegre who lost in Managua continues to question the
election but, despite that, seems not to have presented a formal legal
complaint.<br><br>RR : That is correct. There are no formal legal
complaints. If you go back to November 9th. you will realise that all
this is the result of something very well planned. On election day,
watching television. I saw no disorder. I heard of allegations that
there were problems with some party election officials. I know that
some voting stations may have closed before the scheduled time. I spoke
personally by telephone with Eduardo Montealegre, the ex-candidate for
mayor of Managua and I set myself the task of sorting out each and
every one of the problems he put to me. But these cases were no more
than ten out of two thousand one hundred and seven voting stations.
Which shows you - as well as being an almost non-existent percentage,
those same cases were sorted out. So there was no disorder.<br><br>What
there is, existing and in front of us is a thorough, very well mounted
campaign, very well orchestrated and one that has its own logic.
Montealegre the candidate for mayor of Managua has been candidate for
the country's Presidency and came second. Logically, if he failed to
get enough support from the Nicaraguan electorate in the municipality
of Managua, if that did not work out for him, from a political point of
view he is going to have enormous problems for a future presidential
candidacy and they had to be duly prepared for a setback of that kind,
or for an adverse situation, which is what transpired. Now, very well,
with plenty of money, supported by external forces, supported by some
countries, they have managed to mount a show wanting to make people
believe there was electoral fraud in Nicaragua. Here the only thing
there has been is respect for the popular will&nbsp; and the vote of
the Nicaraguan people has allowed the electoral authority to declare
elected the 146 authorities in the 146 municipalities.<br><br>TcS :
What do you think of the incident in which election material was found
in a rubbish dump in León? Was that genuine or was it a set up?<br><br>RR
: I am presuming, since I still don't have the evidence, we suspect
that all that was a set up, for various reasons. They appeared in the
rubbish tip in the municipality of León, but they were voting papers
from the municipality of Nagarote. This does not put at risk or in
question the election in the municipality of Leon. And there were three
specific municipalities. Nagarote in the department of León, Tipitapa
in the department of Managua and Dolores in the department of Carazo.
In none of these three municipalities was there the least doubt as to
who won or who lost the election. The difference in the votes was such
that voting material found in a waste dump was not going to change the
direction of the election results. This makes me believe that some
party election official at the moment of handing over election material
what they did was dump it in some waste tip with the aim of giving an
appearance that there was disorder so as to try and confuse people in
Nicaragua that a fraud really was happening, with that argument.<br><br>I
contrast this with what happened in 1996 where 50% or more of the
voting station material in Managua appeared in Managua's rubbish dumps.
And the electoral authority at that time was incapable of making a
denunciation to the Public Prosecutor and to seek an investigation. In
our case, we have asked the Public Prosecutor and the police to carry
out an investigation and they are doing so and I guarantee that the
people responsible who are found out&nbsp; will be subject to the full
weight of the law.<br><br>TcS : Another issue that has been remarked on
is a statement you made regarding a possible electronic intervention in
the count system, Was that something significant?<br><br>RR : Not so
much in the count system, I made a statement that we were worried about
any abnormal occurrence on election day. And on election day, the
transmission system was saturated, above all in Managua. And that made
us think there may have been some external element trying to slow down
the transmission system.<br><br>TcS : Is the transmission system a network? <br><br>RR
: Yes, but it uses phone lines. Despite working as a network, it uses
phone lines and that made us think that something may have been going
on. We don't know exactly if it was in the transmission system or if it
was at the very moment that the vote tallies were being put onto the
scanners that something happened. Because the same thing happened in
two other municipalities in the interior of the country that began the
process of putting the tally sheets on the scanner and at the moment of
transmission they did not reach us at the final destination. These
tally sheets remained in some files. But this is a technical
information problem rather than one of interference in the
communication system.<br><br>In the case of Managua, what happened was
that the transmission in Managua being delayed, bringing the physical
tally paper was much quicker than finishing the transmission of the
remainder of Managua's 2107 voting stations. So then we had a problem
there of a legal nature since, once we receive the physical tally
sheet, we can then not treat them as if they were preliminary
provisional votes transmitted in the usual way. So that is the reason
why, when we recorded the cotes we only recorded the votes from 1400
voting stations and we did not record the 2107 in the moment when those
voting tally sheets were handed to us. Then we had to move from
preliminary provisional results to provisional results which is what
was published in the mass print media, like El Nuevo Diario.<br><br>TcS
: Most of the reports of events after the elections reported a great
deal of pressure on your fellow magistrates nominated by the PLC. Is it
possible to comment on that aspect of the situation after the elections?<br><br>RR
: It seems really anti-democratic to me, for a political party to
pressurize a magistrate who agrees ideologically and politically with
that party, for them to press that person not to make up a legal quorum
or not to attend or to oblige that functionary not to comply with his
duty or to fail in his constitutional duty to be present in a situation
like the current one. And we have been lucky enough that the magistrate
Rene Herrera, the magistrate José Marenco and the deputy magistrate
Julio Osuna, who took the place of the proprietary magistrate Luis
Benavidez, participated in the discussion of the declaration of elected
officials. They gave their points of view and fulfilled their
constitutional duty.<br><br>And the response to that was that the
self-styled "democratic forces" proceeded to expel&nbsp; these
magistrates from their party for having carried out their
constitutional duty, which seems to me completely out of line. <br><br>TcS
: Something that emerged in the declaration of the final results was
mention that some magistrates were questioning some of the results. For
example Emmet Lang questioned results in El Crucero and the PLC
magistrates were questioning several results. What were their concerns
about?<br><br>RR : This bring us back again to the results. The
questions of magistrates Herrera, Marenco and Osuna were to do with the
total votes obtained for some municipalities in the preliminary
provisional results, in the transmission of data that we received from
the network being in favour of the PLC over the FSLN and in the end
they turned out completely the other way round in the definitive
results. What happened?<br><br>It is that a number of formal complaints
resolved in the intermediary tribunals before they reach the higher
tribunal always changes the accumulated total votes, because if, for
argument's sake, 10 voting stations are subject to a formal complaint
and the reasons for the complaint are correct and these voting stations
have an average of 200 voters each one would be talking about 2000
votes that would be subtracted from the political party subject to the
complaint. And that changes the election results. <br><br>So the
concerns they expressed was not based on whether or not there may have
been fraud, but was based rather on the argument that the final data
for votes in absolute numbers that we had was different to some degree
from the preliminary provisional votes, or in other words, the data for
votes prior to the resolution of any formal complaints. Still, they are
within their rights after all. If they think theirs is a valid argument
I put it to the vote, they get a majority or not and the matter turns
out as the collegiate group decides that it should.<br><br>TcS :
Something similar is that some international correspondents, for
example John Carlin of the Independent have remarked that some results
published in the newspapers were different to the results on the web
site....<br><br>RR : The answer to that is the same. The difference in
the absolute votes between the web site and their publication, as
prescribed by law, in a mass circulation newspaper lies in the
resolution of formal election complaints. We record the tally sheets
without stating that the voting station is subject to some formal
complaint. We record all the vote tally sheets but at that moment we do
not know which way any formal complaints may end up being resolved.<br><br>TcS
: A surprising number of international reports were still alleging
after the elections that Daniel Ortega had rejected international
election observation....<br><br>RR : That is not true. There were
international observers here. There were representatives from the Latin
America's electoral tribunals, for South America from the Quito
Protocol group, for Central America and the Caribbean from the Tikal
Protocol group and there were observers from the Mexican State
Electoral Tribunal. Two groups of national observers were not involved.
Simply because these observers had aligned with a political party. And
proof of that is what I told CNN in an interview in response to the
false claims of Sergio Ramirez. In the videos taken by international
and local television cameras one can clearly see representatives of
these two groups who had requested to be election observers at the
Princess Hotel in an attempt by Señor Montealegre and the MRS to mount
a demonstration here in the capital. There they were demonstrating in
support of Eduardo Montealegre, all these individuals who had asked for
observer status. So my question then is, were they going to be
observers or representatives of the political parties? <br><br>TcS :
Can one take seriously to any extent the accusation by the PLC that
some of their election officials were prevented from being present at
crucial moments in the voting stations or the count process?<br><br>RR
: There were ten cases in Managua, cases one can count on the fingers
of one's two hands, as I told you earlier, that were resolved
personally. I sent people to sort them out. Of the ten cases, I sorted
out at least seven. And that did not present a problem. However I can
tell you that I have information, I don't have proof to hand, of
someone&nbsp; who was in the campaign centre of the Let's Go With
Eduardo Movement which is part of the PLC alliance, where this person
saw that they were scanning credentials that the Supreme Electoral
Council had given to accredited election officials.<br><br>And when
this person asked what was going on, the justification they gave him
was that the Council had not issued credentials and so they were doing
them there in that way. In synthesis they were falsifying credentials
for election representatives. And that could have caused disorder in a
voting station if a citizen with a forged credential tried to enter and
was detained by the election police in that voting station. But the
issue of the election representatives was not general. One has to be
clear about that. There were incidents. We don't deny that. I can tell
you in my case so far as I recall, of ten well identified cases and of
those more than seven were resolved in favour of the Constitutional
Liberal Party.<br><br>TcS : Now the elections are over for the 146
municipalities that voted on November 9th, I think 7 municipalities
still have to vote in the Northern Autonomous Atlantic Region. How are
preparations going for those elections?<br><br>RR : We are already
working on the organization of those elections in the Northern
Autonomous Atlántic Region. we have set up the necessary structure for
this and the truth is there is no reason for any problems.<br><br>TcS :
When we spoke a couple of months ago, you mentioned that the Supreme
Electoral Council had wanted to hold those elections in April so as to
give more time for the area to recover from the effects of Hurricane
Felix. Has it recovered adequately to be able to hold the elections in
January?<br><br>RR :&nbsp; We have done a verification process - on
November 9th when the rest of the country was in the election. In the
Atlantic municipalities we did a verification process as a kind of
electoral re-registration. It is not obligatory. What happens is that
the citizen who does not turn up is left in the same electoral roll
where they are in the permanent roll. But the citizen who turns up and
asks for a change, whom we hope should be a citizen asking as a result
of the hurricane, the change is simply registered&nbsp; and they are
located in the place where they want to be located<br><br>Permit me to
tell you that there were 30,000 changes. Very high, which has confirmed
via this verification process our assumption that the Coast's electoral
roll was very affected as a consequence of the hurricane. So that's why
what we are doing now is to work out the definitive electoral roll for
the Coast. We hope no major difficulties turn up. We can't see why
there should be, if , maybe, the political classes, there being no
candidate for mayor who wants to be a future President, maybe things
will work out more normally, as has always happened with the other
electoral processes we have had to conduct.<br><br>TcS : What was the verdict you received from the international observers of the November 9th elections?<br><br>RR
: This observation done by specialists, technical people, by
individuals who are electoral magistrates, individuals who conduct
elections, people who have experience in electoral processes and, I
might add, by individuals who have conducted the election processes
that have elected most of the Presidents we have in Latin America
today. These are very serious observation processes, very technical,.
They are not aimed at favouring a particular political party. They are
aimed at showing the electoral tribunal here some weakness they may see
in the electoral process, how they ought to correct it and also to
denounce if they note some situation showing indications that what is
being done may involve a fraud.<br><br>So then these international
observers have given us their remarks in relation to certain very, very
technical issues: how to improve the opening of the voting stations,
how to avoid queues of people by attending to three citizens at the
same time, issues like that, how to manage the election
representatives. Some remarks for example, one of them has said that he
considers that national observers should have been permitted. Others
have said the contrary, for the way in which these groups asking to be
observers were seen to behave and they saw them as simply yet more
members of a political party. But we have indeed received very positive
feedback from them. Logically, not every thing is rosy. When I say
positive, it is that it is very constructive. There are suggestions
they make that could be negative about the way we are working, but they
help us to improve for the future.<br><br>TcS: In the past you have
mentioned that you and your colleagues are interested in seeing some
changes in the electoral law as it stands now. Have these latest
elections confirmed your view on that?<br><br>RR :&nbsp; Yes,
definitely. Yes. No more than other elections. Every time an election
process is over we, on reflection, again realise the need for electoral
reform, but more in the technical sense than the political sense. For
example, on the matter of accreditation of the election
representatives, to force the political parties to present in plenty of
time the proposal to authorize their electoral representatives. Or for
example the fact that the production of identity cards has to be closed
down 90 days prior to election day, that ought to disappear because it
affects people who have lost their document and are unable to replace
it.<br><br>And one ought to close the electoral roll ahead of time. In
countries like Panama, the electoral roll closes a year or six months
before. And no one protests saying it's a trick to close the electoral
roll months in advance. Personally, I would eliminate the chapter in
the electoral law referring to the communications media. And I would
just leave it with a single article saying that all the communications
media, without exception, are obliged to provide space, on the basis
always of a contractual obligation on their part, to all the political
parties regardless of their ideology, regardless of the candidates or
who they represent.<br><br>And also there is a series of technical
elements that I think should be considered - the reasons for
annulling&nbsp; a voting station. One has to consider the system for
giving results, because the law is very rigid on that - preliminary
provisional results, provisional results and definitive results - and
it generates the type of confusion you are telling me about and the
speculation in the international reports. Like the fact there is a
difference between the results published in the mass print media and
the results appearing on the web site based on the records in the
database and so ensure that the law state that the Supreme Electoral
Council should not record voting stations subject to formal complaint
in the count centre until there is a resolution for that voting
station. So then that would no longer generate that difference between
what is seen in the web site and their publication in print.<br><br>TcS : Do you want to add anything as a general comment on the experience of the last two weeks?<br><br>RR
: Only that what has happened here is the people's expression, lodged
in the voting places , that the law has been strictly respected, that
whatever situation that may have arisen is not one provoked by or
promoted by ourselves, but rather simply a situation that the law
compels us to fulfill in a given way. And that we do indeed feel that
there is a thorough campaign, something wholly planned, a comprehensive
programme to create the impression that this process has not been a
legitimate process but that it has been an illegitimate process, which
is something that is totally false. <br><br></td>
