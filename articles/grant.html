The recent death in Nicaragua of Grant Gallup, an Espicopalian minister
from the United States, prompts the usual feelings of bereavement and
gratitude as the loss of any much-loved and respected person. But
Grant's was much more than a benign presence dispensing wisdom,
goodness and occasionally barbed wit to those around him. Grant Gallup
was a resolute defender of human rights and a determined advocate of
revolutionary change in favour of the impoverished majority. Grant
figured as himself in the 1986 film "Before Stonewall". <br>
      <br>
A brief biographical note <a href="http://www.pbase.com/danpolley/grantgallup">here</a> notes, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Born Jan. 28, 1932, in Stambaugh, Michigan, Gallup entered Alma
College, a Presbyterian affiliate, in 1950, and graduated magna cum
laude. He entered Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in 1956.
For three decades Gallup served St. Andrew's Church, an
African-American mission on Chicago's west side. Gallup marched with
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and once hosted the Black Panthers in his
parish hall. He was a charter member of Integrity USA and the first
chaplain to the Chicago chapter. Lifelong friend and Integrity founder
Louie Crew once asked Gallup how, as a gay man, parishioners were
dealing with his openness, to which Grant responded, "The same way I
deal with theirs." In 2003, Gallup travelled to Iraq, offering himself
as a human shield in hopes of preventing the impending U.S. invasion.
For many years, Gallup published weekly sermons he called "Homily
Grits."</span>"<br>
      <br>
After retiring to Nicaragua in 1988, Grant's base at the Casa Ave Maria
in Managua's Barrio Monseñor Lezcano became a welcome haven for
thousands of visitors to Nicaragua from all over the world. The mural
he created there in homage to revolutionary religious women in the
Americas was emblematic of his belief both in the fundamental need for
equality and too in the inspirational leadership of women to defeat
injustice. Grant's Maria was less the submissive head-in-the-clouds
Virgin Mother and more a practical get-things-done, stand-your-ground
Mother Courage.<br>
      <br>
If one considers the spiritual, moral-political generational group of
which Grant Gallup was so very much a part, the roll call includes
notable figures still alive like Miguel D'Escoto, Roy Bourgeois, Thomas
Gumbleton, as well as a sobering list of martyrs. That list includes
the four US religious, Jean Donovan. Dorothy Kazel, Maura Clarke and
Ita Ford murdered outside San Salvador in 1981 and Padre Guadelupe &#8211; Fr. James
Carney - disappeared by the Honduran army and its US advisers in
Honduras in 1983. Perhaps the clearest moral-political cause uniting
all these people is their steadfast rejection of the effects of
militarism in the service of economic and political injustice that so
markedly characterizes the Americas.<br>
      <br>
Diametrically opposed to that group of revolutionary religious figures
is the class of military and diplomatic functionaries, in the service of
cynical, ruthless US government administrations, currently seeking by
any means to recoup the US plutocracy's declining power, influence and
control. One of the propaganda motifs deployed by that class is the
fake motif of anti-Americanism. Whenever that motif is deployed it
betrays the extent of the propaganda collusion between the
international corporate media and the US government.<br>
      <br>
The sleight of hand is twofold. Firstly, the frauds who use the term
&#8220;anti-Americanism&#8221; collapse all of Latin America, North America and the
Caribbean into the United States. Secondly, they collapse the United
States into its government. This profundly disturbed megalomaniacal
move then interprets legitimate criticism of the US government's
characteristic cynical, sadistic, hypocritical foreign policy as
&#8220;anti-Americanism&#8221;. <br>
      <br>
That absurd counterfactual quasi-rationality effectively erases the
very existence of outstanding individuals like Grant and his fellow
dissident US religious companions. The mere phrase &#8220;anti-Americanism&#8221;
rewrites the history of the US government's crimes against humanity not
just in the Americas but everywhere. Americanism itself is in fact the
pernicious doctrine that only US plutocrat elite perceptions and
perceived interests are important, that the interests and well being or
even the very existence of everyone else is completely subordinate. <br>
      <br>
As Malcolm X remarked &#8220;I just try to face the fact as it actually is
and come to this meeting as one of the victims of America, one of the
victims of Americanism, one of the victims of democracy, one of the
victims of a very hypocritical system that is going all over this earth
today representing itself as being qualified to tell other people how
to run their country when they can&#8217;t get the dirty things that are
going on in their own country straightened out.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
US elites have acted throughout history against the material interests
and fundamental rights of the United States people, against all the
people of the Americas. Currently, the same elite class that has
persistently betrayed the interests of the US people overseas is now
inflicting an even deeper betrayal at home. Trillions of dollars have
been devoted to rescue the elite's bankrupt Wall Street cronies while
over 15 million US citizens are unemployed &#8211; abundant welfare for the
rich, the brush-off for everyone else.<br>
      <br>
The psychotic autism of the frauds who deploy the arguments of
&#8220;anti-Americanism&#8221; defies rational analysis. A recent example of the
genre was the question put by Robert Blau, the senior US diplomat in El
Salvador to the leadership of the FMLN. Objecting to what he termed
&#8220;anti-American&#8221; remarks by an FMLN leader Blau remarked &#8220;I want to
know, what is the true position of the FMLN with respect to my
country?&#8221; <br>
      <br>
One wonders what Blau expects the FMLN leadership to say. That they
detest Louis Armstrong, Jimi Hendrix and Aaron Copeland? That they are
angry at the sporting achievments of Muhammed Ali, Mark Spitz or Jack
Nicklaus? That they vehemently reject the philosophical writings of
Daniel Dennett, W.V.O.Quine or John Rawls? That they don't find Lenny
Bruce, Woody Allen or Eddie Murphy funny? It is a trivial fact that the
FMLN leadership object to US government foreign policy which for
decades has consistently supported the FMLN's murderous enemies in
ARENA nationally and in the local oligarchies regionally. Blau's
indignation is pure, cynical play-acting, like those soccer players
that dive in the penalty area.<br>
      <br>
The sheer banal obtuseness of individuals like Blau and other suave
barbarian confrère Negroponte-spawn like Robert Callahan in Nicaragua,
or Hugo Llorens in Honduras points to the enduring, timeless duplicity
and mediocrity of US government diplomacy. That diplomacy has
consistently betrayed the interests of the huge majority of people in
the United States. Domestically, the same class of people has wiped out
the high-wage manufacturing economy of the United States, condemning
the vast majority of the country's population to what Michael Hudson
and others rightly describe as &#8220;debt peonage&#8221;.<br>
      <br>
If the US ruling classes want to identify the fiendish sources and
leading proponents of anti-United States government feeling, they have
only to look in the mirror and consider what they themselves have done
to their country and its people. The saving virtue and undying glory of
the United States are its many millions of great humanitarians like
Grant Gallup who recognise their own humanity in that of everyone else
in the world. They do so and act accordingly out of an incomparable
spirit of fellowship and love.<br>
