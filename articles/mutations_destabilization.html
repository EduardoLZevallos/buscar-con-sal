      <p>There are no excuses for playing the innocent about the
motives
behind US funding of "civil
society" in Nicaragua. In the last analysis, this sort of funding is
part of the political-military plan to destabilize and dominate the
country, in exactly the same way as in other ALBA countries like
Bolivia and Venezuela. The nationals implicated in the administration
of these funds should jump ship as soon as possible if they want to
avoid going down in history as traitors to their country.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
      <p> The destabilization strategy in Venezuela, based on the
in-country installation of a US Agency for Development
(USAID) Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) by the subcontractor
DAI,&nbsp; is documented by Eva Golinger in her book, "The Chávez
Code". (1) This same strategy is being applied to Nicaragua with
USAID's
CamTransparency Program managed by a branch of the paramilitary
multinational DynCorp. The names are different, the scheme is the
same.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
      <p>As is well known, USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy
(NED), the International Republican Institute (IRI), etc., have
channelled millions of dollars of "aid" to "civil society"
organizations which, in turn, function as an informal political party
to destabilize the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity.
It's difficult to keep track of all of this "aid," but on occasion the
US Embassy itself publishes relevant information.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>This was the case for the disbursement of some US$320,000 to
"small projects" carried out by 15 Nicaraguan NGOs by the then US
Ambassador in Managua Paul Trivelli and the then interim head of USAID
in Managua, Carol Horning at the end of May 2008. (2) These projects
were part of a plan to sabotage the municipal elections of the same
year and, at the same time, to isolate Nicaragua by the subsequent
suspension of a certain amount of international aid.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
The projects, which had a value of between US$13,000 and US$15,000
each, were carried out by a heterogeneous group&nbsp; of NGOs ranging
from Duo Guardabarranco to Radio 15th of September, from individuals
like Fernando Avellán and Enrique Quiñónez to
Carlos Chamorro's CINCO Group as well as local US organizations like
Ética y Transparencia. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It is essential to emphasize that none of this financial "aid"
is innocent, none of it is provided for mere ideological motives - the
motives are geopolitical and military. The members of the US team that
manages these funds in Managua are military politicians: <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The current US Ambassador in Managua, Robert J. Callahan,
(3) was John Dimitri Negroponte's public relations secretary&nbsp;
when, from the US Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Negroponte converted Honduras
into a sanctuary for the Contra fighters in the '80s. Twenty years
later
Callahan worked again with Negroponte as head of public relations in
occupied Iraq. At one point during his time in Iraq, Callahan's
convoy, contracted from the mercenary company Blackwater, shot at a
taxi carrying a number of civilians, killing 19 year old Iraqi Yas Ali
Mohammed Yassiri and injuring the driver Mohammed Nouri Hattab (4).
Before the end of his mission in Iraq, Callahan gave a series of
lectures in the National War Academy in Washington DC. During the two
years prior to his appointment as US Ambassador in Managua in July 2008
Callahan was the Public Affairs Officer for the Director of National
Intelligence in Washington DC. After Callahan's appointment as
Ambassador in Managua was announced, New York Times journalist Stephen
Kinzer commented: "... it is a strange choice (...) considering that
Callahan helped to inflict on Nicaragua one of the bloodiest wars in
the country's history."&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
        <li>Callahan's predecessor, Paul Trivelli, also has links to
the US military (5): after leaving the Embassy in Managua in August
2008 his was named Civilian Deputy and Foreign Policy Adviser to the US
Southern Command in Miami. The Southern Command itself explains that,
as Civilian Deputy, Trivelli is responsible for permanently developing
and refining the Southern Command's regional strategy - it's Theatre of
War Plan - and the strategy of Security Cooperation for that same
theatre. He also has a key role in terms of coordination between US
agencies working towards the practical implementation of those plans.
As Foreign Policy Adviser he advises the head of the Southern Command
and other commanders in charge of foreign policy affairs relevant to
National Security. As for Trivelli's academic formation - he received a
Masters in National Security Studies from the Naval War Academy in
1996.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The former Director of USAID in Nicaragua during the
Trivelli era, Carol Horning, also has a past involving military
formation having carried out studies about the National Security
Strategy in the US War Academy between 2004 and 2005. (6)&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Offices of Transition Initiatives (OTIs) (7) began to be
installed by USAID around the world in 1994. The objective of the first
OTIs was to support the transition towards capitalism in Eastern
European countries. Soon their field of action expanded to places like
Kosovo, Haiti, Indonesia, the Philippines, Colombia and wherever else
the US needed to "resolve" situations in which its domination was
being threatened. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Instructed by USAID, the OTIs install networks of political
parties, media outlets and NGOs in the countries in which they operate,
providing the funding and training those organizations need to
implement, on the ground, policies obeying US objectives for the
country in questions,&nbsp; objectives which vary from Coup d'Etats to
insurgent struggles or military interventions. &nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the case of Venezuela, the OTI in Caracas was created in
July 2002, shortly after the failed coup against Hugo Chávez. In
order to develop it's work in Venezuela, the OTI contracted a
multinational linked to the US industrial military complex, Development
Alternatives, Inc (DAI), which initially administered a fund of US$10
million for a project entitled "Venezuela: Trust Building Initiatives."
That money was used to fund the organizations that promoted and carried
out the oil strike of the same year as well as the right wing parties
and organizations opposed to the Bolivarian process. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
      </p>
      <p>The OTI in Bolivia was opened towards the end of 2005 in an
attempt to impede Evo Morales' rise to power. This time the company
Casals &amp; Associates (8), an affiliate of the paramilitary
multinational DynCorp, was contracted. The initial budget of the OTI in
La Paz was US$13.6 million. Calculations suggest that since then, the
local OTI together with USAID have channelled some US$120 million to
diverse opposition groups including the fascist groups from the
so-called "Media Luna" region which promoted secession from the country -
groups&nbsp; who are also responsible for uncountable acts of terror
and even massacres against the civilian population. These facts led the
Bolivian government to declare the US Ambassador Phillip Goldberg
persona non-grata and to warn USAID that, should they continue funding
similar activities, the organization would be expelled from the country.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>
      <p>In Nicaragua there is no Office of Transition Initiatives
(which USAID itself translates incorrectly to Spanish as "Office of
Democratic Initiatives"). In any case, the name is not important,
because the contractor is the same as in Bolivia - DynCorp.</p>
      <p>Dyncorp is a private US military defence company that has been
contracted to participate in diverse conflicts where US hegemony is in
question, the most notorious being Iraq and Colombia. It is well known
and documented that the mercenaries contracted by DynCorp have a vast
record of human rights violations in many parts of the world to the
extent that they were even accused of terrorism in the US in 2002 for
fumigations carried out against Ecuadorian campesinos near the border
with Colombia. (10) <br>
      </p>
      <p>In Bosnia DynCorp organized a network of adolescent
prostitution. In Iraq and Afghanistan the company has been accused of
committing massacres, it was also accused of corruption. In Colombia,
DynCorp trains the army and the paramilitaries and is responsible for
the fumigation operations as part of Plan Colombia. DynCorp operated
from the US Military Base in Manta, Ecuador, until the base was closed
recently. Now thanks to an initial contract worth US$21 millions,
DynCorp operates in Central America. (11) <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Program "Transparency, Anti corruption and Responsibility
in Central America and Mexico" (CamTransparencia) is active in
Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama. The reason Honduras has
been eliminated from the list is probably to do with the coup d'état
against President Manuel Zelaya, but there is reason to believe that
the program is still active. It is revealing that neither Costa Rica
nor Mexico are on the list which is made up of countries where US
hegemony is, or has until recently been, threatened.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The general objective of the program is described as being "to
support governmental and non governmental initiatives towards greater
transparency and less corruption in all participating countries and to
promote sustainable reform of public policies."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In Nicaragua CamTransparencua has organized discussion forums
and other similar activities, but among its efforts emphasis is placed
on attempts to influence European donor country policies, to favour the
US' agenda of political funding by the NED, IRI, IDI, as well as the
funding of local "civil society" organizations according to US
priorities and above all for propaganda purposes.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The list of "partners" of CamTransparencia / DynCorp in
Nicaragua is the following: <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grupo Fundemos</li>

      </ul>
      <p>The current head of the CamTransparencia Project in Nicaragua
is Mary
Hogan who studied US National Security strategy. Hogan's past involves
work with USAID's Peace Corps and with ARD, Inc. a consulting agency
specializing in "governance processes." In the recent past, Hogan was
head of OIT programs in Zimbabwe and Uganda and advisor for a similar
program in Paraguay. (12)&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
USAID's CamTransparencia program is managed by the Casals &amp;
Associates, an affiliate of the paramilitary
multinational DynCorp. It is important to point out that both DynCorp
and Casals &amp;
Associates have a long history in Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
On January 25th this year, the Casals &amp; Associates website
announced that DynCorp had bought 100% of the company's shares (13).
Details
of the value of the purchase were not made available. <br>
      <br>
"the acquisition brings together the complementary skills, experience
and capacity of Casals and DynCorp International to strengthen the
strategic expansion of DynCorp International into the international
development field," reads the communiqué announcing the move.
"Together they offer a best in class combination of
competencies to provide services supporting U.S. defence, diplomacy and
international development initiatives and objectives."<br>
      <br>
Casals &amp; Associates has much experience in terms of "supporting the
democratic transition" [SIC!] in Nicaragua. According to the US Agency
for International
Development (USAID) Website (14), in 1995 USAID awarded its first
bilateral anti-corruption
contract to Casals &amp; Associates specifically to advise the
Nicaragua
government, which at that point was confronted with a national economy
in ruins after years of war. The
objective of the project was to improve the government's capacity to
reduce the potential of waste, fraud and other forms of abuse of
resources by establishing an integrated auditing system and an
integrated financial administration system. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
What happened next is well known in Managua - a gory electoral fraud
against the FSLN in the national elections of the following year and
two neo liberal governments whose officials stole the chilling sum of
C$18,000 million (some US$900 million) of public funds. <br>
      <br>
But the union between Casals &amp; Associates and DynCorp becomes even
more significant taking into account the country's history. <br>
      <br>
In February of 2007, the Colombian Branch of the Permanent People's
Tribunal presented an accusation against DynCorp for its direct
participation in human rights violations in the South American country.
The report
(15), prepared by the Lawyers Collective "José Alvear Restrepo,"
quotes abundant information about DynCorp's activities as part of the
US'
dirty war against Nicaragua in the 80s including the following:<br>
      <br>
A DynCorp subcontractor involved itself directly in Nicaragua's
internal
conflict - "the company Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc.
(EAST), subcontracted by DynCorp, helped Lieutenant Colonel Oliver
North, as part of the Iran-Contra scandal in the 80s, to transport arms
and
munitions for the Nicaraguan insurgents in their struggle against the
Sandinista government [i]."<br>
      <br>
According to more detailed information [ii] "during the 80s, EAST and
its founder Richard Gadd, helped North, then an official on the
National Security Council, with the clandestine supply of arms and
munitions to the Nicaraguan Contras after the US Congress had
prohibited US government supply of lethal arms [to the Contras]".&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
North also arranged for other of Gadd's companies to be awarded State
Department contracts involving the provision of above board
humanitarian aid. This gave rise to what the independent counsel for
the Iran-Contra scandal, Lawrence Walsh, described as "a rare
occasion [in which] a U.S. government program unwittingly provided
cover to a
private covert operation." <br>
      <br>
The revelation of the arms operation in favour of the Contra, which was
partially funded with the sale of arms to Iran, led to the conviction
that top functionaries from the Reagan administration were involved.
Gadd testified in the Iran-Contra case evoking an immunity clause which
freed both himself and EAST from criminal conviction. <br>
      <br>
In his testimony about the Iran-Contra scandal Gadd explained that EAST
was one of many companies he formed after retiring in 1982 as a
Lieutenant Colonel specializing in undercover operations in the US Air
Force. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
During the 80s, the Contra rebels tried to overthrow the left-wing
Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The Reagan administration, which
perceived the Sandinistas as a Marxist threat in Central America,
supported the Contra. The Democrats, which controlled the US Congress
at the time, believed that the US government should stay out of the
conflict and should not permit US officials to provide lethal support
to the Contras. <br>
      <br>
As a result North was forced to look to General (RE) Richard Secord for
support in creating a private link that would permit a supply of arms
to the Contra. In 1985 Secord contracted Gadd to oversee the provision
of arms. It was through EAST that Gadd facilitated the acquisition of
planes which carried arms and munitions from Portugal to Central
America where they were dropped from the air into the Contra camps.
EAST also constructed a runway in Costa Rica near the border with
Nicaragua. According to Walsh's final report [iii], EAST received a
total of US$550,000 for its undercover work in relation to the Contra
insurgency.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
As stated previously, Nicaragua is subjected to a destabilization
strategy similar to the ones being forged in other ALBA countries like
Venezuela and Bolivia. Here there is no Office of Transition
Initiatives but a program to promote "transparency." And the senior
members of the team in charge of that program have vast experience in
"regime change" operations.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In truth, there is a long history behind "the US' commitment to
democracy in Nicaragua." And from the moment DynCorp got involved
again, the historic continuity of that "commitment" was taken up again in a
very direct and palpable way. The ones financing "transparency" and
"democracy" in Nicaragua today are the same people and institutions
that provoked bloodshed in the country two decades ago. And they will
do it again - if they get the chance. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
