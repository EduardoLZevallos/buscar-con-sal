more transparent example of persistent deceit and falsehood would be
hard to find than the current campaign attempting to discredit
Nicaragua's municipal elections of November 9th. The controversy makes
little sense in isolation. It is the latest phase of a long
disinformation campaign, begun even before Nicaragua's presidential
elections of 2006. It is also part of the wider campaign by the United
States and its European accomplices to undermine Latin American
regional integration processes threatening their power and influence
and that of their allies among the local regional elites. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This
is especially true of the countries making up the Alternativa
Bolivariana para las Américas - ALBA - led by Venezuela and Cuba. In
that alliance, Nicaragua and Honduras are the weakest countries because
they are the countries where the US government sponsored opposition
have most chance of reversing the progressive and radical aspects of
the ALBA integration initiative. In Nicaragua, the drift in popular
support from the right and centre-right to the Sandinista-led FSLN
government has been emphatic. The response in terms of hysteria and
falsehood from the Nicaraguan opposition parties, faced with&nbsp;
ever-dwindling national credibility, has been fierce, desperate and
consummately fake.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Among
the leading figures accusing Nicaragua's electoral authorities of
having rigged the November municipal elections is Gioconda Belli, the
award winning novelist. She has followed Sergio Ramirez, another
world-famous novelist, in claiming the elections were fraudulent.
Ramirez's mixture of deceit and falsehood - that votes were stolen,
that observers were not permitted, that the electoral authority is
corrupt - <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/132">was effectively exposed by the President of Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council</a>
on CNN's widely followed "Arestigüi" current affairs programme in
Spanish. Ignoring Roberto Rivas' exposé of Ramirez as a shameless fake,
Gioconda Belli broadly repeated the same deceits and falsehoods <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/Nicaragua/elpepuopi/20081213elpepiopi_9/Tes">in a response to an article by Benjamín Forcano</a> that she wrote to El País on December 12th .</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Belli's
response tries to compare the municipal elections of 2008 with the
fraudulent presidential elections of 1996. She suggests that those
elections, won by an alliance of right wing parties - the Liberal
Alliance - were unaffected by widely acknowledged fraud, whereas the
latest municipal elections, by contrast, were. The point of Belli's
fakery is to suggest something even worse happened in the recent
municipal elections. The facts contradict Belli's untruth. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">She
falsely asserts that the dumping of over 30% of ballots in the capital
city Managua in 1996 would not have affected the overall result.&nbsp;
In doing so she contradicts the opinion of Roberto Rivas. Who should
one believe - Belli, the parti-pris fiction writer, or Rivas, a member
of Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council at the time of the 1996
election? A fact that neither Belli nor her fellow social democrat
fraud-squad members acknowledge is that one of their number, Rosa
Marina Zelaya, was president of the CSE in 1996. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><a href="en_presidente_cse.html">In a recent interview, Roberto Rivas recounted,</a>
without mentioning the names, how in 1996 Zelaya presided over dodgy
electoral shenanigans to make sure her husband, Jorge Samper, was
assigned a seat in the National Assembly. At the time both Samper and
Zelaya were supporters of Sergio Ramirez's Movimiento Renovador
Sandinista. That shameful episode is one of numerous facts individuals
like Belli skim over in their desperate efforts to pervert the truth
and mislead as wide an international public as possible. After having
anti-democratically filched dozens of FSLN deputies in the previous
legislative period, Ramirez' MRS was punished in 1996 by getting wiped
out electorally, winning barely 5% of the national vote. They have
never done much better since.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Whereas
Belli puts thoroughly deceitful spin on the events of over a decade
ago, she is downright dishonest about Nicaragua's recent municipal
elections in November. Her response to Forcano's article makes the
following false claims:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">the electoral authorities failed to include results from 600 voting stations in Managua - but they did</span></li><li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">the opposition PLC were not adequately notified in advance of a recount in Managua - but it was</span></li><li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">the recount could not possibly have been accomplished in the time stated by the electoral authority - but it was</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Anyone
who has followed the controversy in the local media will note that the
logic applied by Belli and her fraud-squad accomplices is impossible to
falsify because she and her fraud-squad accuse the Supreme Electoral
Council of being corrupt. They pit their own faithless allegations -
supported by artificially concocted data stripped of the relevant legal
and administrative context - against the results as presented by the
municipal, departmental and national electoral authorities. The
fraud-squad present no hard genuinely falsifiable evidence. Their case
depends entirely on high volume, high profile media repetition for its
effect.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Where
Belli most closely follows Sergio Ramirez's bare-faced falsity is on
the issue of election observers. She alleges that "impartial observers"
were barred from the recount. She offers no evidence for that. The
electoral authority did refuse accreditation for the elections to two
opposition-aligned election monitoring groups funded by USAID that had
for months accused the Supreme Electoral Council of being corrupt.
These seem to be the "impartial observers" Belli refers to.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Belli
states outright that experienced, qualified and competent international
observers were absent from the elections. She refers to the presence of
just one group that she alleges was biased because, she argues, it was
created by&nbsp; the Venezuelan government. She also states that this
group was inexperienced. She is referring to the Latin American Council
of Electoral Experts (CEELA), a group made up of representatives from
electoral authorities across Latin America. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">CEELA's
members are election professionals whose work is precisely to organize
and supervise elections. These are the people Belli suggests are too
inexperienced to have supervised Nicaragua's municipal elections
competently. When she suggests that CEELA is a tool of Hugo Chavez she
is asking people to ignore the presence in the CEELA delegation of
individuals like Colombia's former Minister of Justice, Guillermo
Reyes, by no means a left-winger and certainly no chavista.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Belli
complements that crass dishonesty by deliberately omitting the fact
that three other important groups of election observers participated in
monitoring the elections of November 9th. These were:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Tikal Protocol group of election specialists from Central America and the Caribbean, </span></li><li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Quito Protocol group of election specialists from all over South America</span></li><li><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">a group of observers from Mexico's Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación (TRIFE)</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
total these groups numbered well over 120 individuals all of whom
follow professional careers in the electoral authorities of their
respective countries. It is completely dishonest of Belli to omit any
mention of the presence of these observers and the fact that they
vouched for the fairness and transparency of the electoral process of
November 9th.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Dishonesty
and deceit are the hallmark of Sergio and Gioconda's fraud-squad
antics. They have become so accustomed to misrepresenting the facts,
they seem no longer to notice they are doing it. In 2008, Belli was
trying to claim the political group she supports, the Movimiento
Renovador Sandinista, and the anti-government events it organized, did
not get funding from the US government and its quasi-non-governmental
spawn like the National Endowment for Democracy, the International
Republican Institute, and the National Democratic Institute. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
the MRS has received money directly from the IRI. A member organization
of the MRS, the Movimiento Autónomo de Mujeres, was found out recently,
after an investigation by the public prosecutor's office, to have
received money under the table from governments of the Budget Support
Group, a foreign donor-country body in Nicaragua that blatantly
supports the country's political opposition. Likewise groups organizing
anti-government events on which the MRS piggy-backed - like the
Movimiento por Nicaragua - depend heavily on funding from the US
government and its quasi non-governmental front organizations.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Another
deception the MRS fraud squad has sustained is the one about the MRS
losing its legal status as a political party as a result of government
persecution. MRS leaders like Dora Maria Tellez deliberately and
dishonestly obscured the fact that it was their current political
allies, the Partido Liberal Constitucionalista, who initiated the
administrative process that led to the demise of the MRS as a legally
constituted political party. The political logic of the MRS' consensual
euthanasia was twofold. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Firstly,
the move created a bogus crisis of democracy that would enable
individuals like Dora Maria Tellez to claim, falsely, that she and her
party were victims of government persecution. Secondly, the move
enabled the right and centre-right to form a united opposition giving
their consensus candidate, Eduardo Montealegre, a clear run against the
FSLN in the capital Managua. It did them no good, Montealegre, a
hopelessly uninspiring candidate, still lost by a mile. Gioconda Belli,
Sergio Ramirez, Dora Maria Tellez and their colleagues have worked
systematically to deceive public opinion in Nicaragua and abroad about
that result. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Nationally,
where majority popular opinion is against them, they have failed.&nbsp;
So far the PLC elite in the National Assembly and the
Ramirez-Belli-Tellez fraud-squad have been unable to mobilise mass
opinion in the country. To date their campaign inside Nicaragua remains
the flailing PR media campaign of a politically marooned elite.
Internationally, their campaign of deceit has enjoyed much greater
success. They and their foreign backers seem to be banking on being
able to manipulate the effects of the international economic crisis so
as to turn opinion in Nicaragua sharply against the FSLN. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
political and moral failure of Nicaragua's right and centre-right
political parties is likely to deepen through 2009. With presidential
elections soon in El Salvador and later in the year in Honduras, one
can expect yet more foreign intervention on behalf of right wing and
social democrat movements in Central America. The US and European
governments are struggling to prevent in Central America the kind of
debacle experienced by their regional proxies in countries like
Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"></span><br></td>
