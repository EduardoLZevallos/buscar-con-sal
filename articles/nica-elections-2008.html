<br>For
months the right wing opposition parties have been setting up their
current&nbsp; frantic efforts to destabilize Nicaragua following their
candidate's defeat in the municipal elections for the capital city
Managua. On Sunday November 9th municipal elections were held in 146 of
Nicaragua's 153 municipalities. The latest results give the FSLN-led
Unida Nicaragua Triunfa coalition&nbsp; 91 municipalities, including
Managua. The opposition Partido Liberal Constitucionalista party has
50, the smaller Alianza Liberal Nicaraguense&nbsp; party has three with
two muncipalities still undeclared as of the evening of November
12th. <br><br>The victory largely reproduces the results of the 2004
municipal elections, with the Pacific Coast departments voting for the
FSLN and the Atlantic Coast and central departments voting for the
Liberal parties. Another six municipalities on the northern Atlantic
Coast will vote in January once organization and infrastructure have
been made good following the devastation caused by Hurricane Felix in
2007. The vote itself took place calmly enough, as usual, throughout
the country. The aftermath has been wracked by baseless,
heavily-contrived allegations of fraud and by right-wing instigated
violence<br><br>The violent response of the losing right wing parties
may seem strange since the&nbsp; results change little in Nicaragua's
local government in terms of&nbsp; the balance of power. But there is a
very simple reason why the right wing opposition are reacting so
desperately. For the first time since the revolutionary government of
the 1980s, the FSLN has defeated a united electoral front of the right
wing opposition. Ever since the watershed 1990 election the right wing
in Nicaragua have enjoyed structural electoral dominance. These
elections have changed that reality, probably for good.<br><br>The context for right-wing desperation<br><br>After
Daniel Ortega's FSLN-led coalition government took office in January
2007, it took the Nicaraguan opposition several months to work out how
they might effectively undermine the FSLN government's programme. By
mid-2007 they had settled on a strategy of attrition, alleging
corruption and repression. The allegations of corruption focused on the
government's successful poverty reduction programmes. <br><br>The Zero
Hunger programme assisted low-income rural families. Zero Usury funded
urban micro-businesses. Both programmes prioritized women. Streets for
the People paved hundreds of kilometres of streets in neglected urban
districts. Houses for the People has provided affordable housing to
hundreds of low income urban families.<br><br>All these programmes were
funded with assistance from Venezuela. They were funded either through
credit from Venezuela's Social and Economic Development Bank, Bandes,
or through the ALBA framework via the long-term credits freed up from
oil purchases via the Petrocaribe concessionary energy agreement. Other
programmes facilitated through ALBA&nbsp; with Venezuelan and Cuban
support were the Misión Milagro medical programme and the Yo Sí Puedo
literacy programme. <br><br>But the Venezuelan cooperation programmes
were just part of the FSLN government's overall economic plan which has
focused successfully on reactivating the small and medium agricultural
sectors with credits, technical support and inputs. Overall exports
reached record levels in 2007 and again in 2008. For that reason the
business sector in Nicaragua has worked well with the FSLN coalition
government, especially with the Vice President, former Contra leader,
the banker Jaime Morales. Far from foreign investment staying away as
government critics predicted, it has grown steadily with large
investments by companies from all over the world, including the United
States.<br><br>Internationally the government has built relations not
just with the main ALBA countries, Bolivia, Cuba and Venezuela, but
with countries as diverse as Taiwan, Mexico, Iran, Algeria, Brazil,
Russia and Libya. Nicaragua's former Foreign Minister,&nbsp; Fr. Miguel
D'Escoto, was elected President of the current United Nations General
Assembly. Nicaragua works closely with its Central American neighbours.
It maintains, currently somewhat strained, relations with Nicaragua's
traditional European Union donor countries. Despite deep ideological
antipathy, the government maintains surprisingly cordial relations with
the United States government. Just last week the US government donated
US$5 million to a programme to promote children's rights.<br><br>The nitty gritty of electoral destabilization<br><br>It
seems to be precisely that startlingly successful record that has
stoked desperation among the right-wing opposition in Nicaragua. In
addition to the regular baseless allegations of corruption, the other
twin strand of their disinformation campaign has been a persistent,
shrill chorus alleging repression and threats to freedom of speech. It
is hard for people outside Nicaragua to gauge the viciousness and
deceit of this disinformation campaign. News is filtered through
disingenuous social democrat assumptions compounded by outright
falsehood and cynical set-pieces.<br><br>One such cynical set piece was
the self-destruction of the opposition Movimiento Renovador Sandinista.
Earlier this&nbsp; year, many people were puzzled by the decision of
the Movimiento Renovador Sandinista not to obey requests from the
electoral authorities to comply with the rules governing political
parties. In June party leader Dora Maria Tellez staged a
much-publicised hunger strike to highlight the case for local and
international media.<br><br>It is now very clear that Tellez and her
colleagues made a deliberate decision to flout the electoral law so as
to self-destruct their political party. This decision served two
purposes. Firstly, it allowed them to strengthen their claims that the
government is dictatorial through a disingenuous insistence
that&nbsp;their party was unfairly stripped of its legal status.
Secondly, it permitted the right-wing factions to mount a united
electoral front against the FSLN with Tellez and MRS leader Edmundo
Jarquin calling on their supporters to vote for right wing candidates.
They hoped this would especially benefit Eduardo Montealegre, the right
wing leader currently facing charges of fraud and corruption, in his
efforts to win the municipality of Managua, where MRS support is
strongest.<br><br>The MRS slogan all through 2008 has been "Ortega y
Somoza son la misma cosa" - Ortega and Somoza are the same thing. They
used explicit imagery to associate this slogan with the assassination
of Anastasio Somoza by Rigoberto Lopez Perez in 1956. The cynical and
sinister subliminal message has been that legitimately elected
President Daniel Ortega deserved the same fate. This vicious message
shoved the limits of the campaign to such extremes that less virulent
but still hugely damaging accusations were made to look moderate. The
paradoxical fact that the opposition decried threats to freedom of
expression while at the same time&nbsp;publicly and feeely suggesting
that the President be assassinated seemed to be lost on the national
and international media.<br><br>The campaign has been facilitated by
the virtual press monopoly of the Chamorro family,&nbsp;among the most
prominent of Nicaragua's oligarchy. Chamorro family members own the two
most widely read and influential national daily newspapers in Nicaragua
as well as managing the influential Esta Noche and Esta Semana current
affairs programmes. That media platform operates in cahoots with the
country's leading television right wing channel Canal 2, whose
presenters over the last few days have openly encouraged disturbances
orchestrated by Eduardo Montealegre and his colleagues.<br><br>Local
opposition-aligned NGOs have also played a vital role in developing the
anti-government campaign, just as they did in Haiti&nbsp;prior to the
coup against President Aristide and as they continue to do in
Venezuela, targeting the government of President Hugo Chavez. Recently,
the Nicaraguan government moved to prevent non-profits among those NGOs
making illegal use of foreign donations to fund anti-government
political activities. The Chamorro media empire combined with NGOs,
foreign government representatives and right wing politicians to
promote an international uproar. As if any country in the world would
tolerate such blatant abuse of funds donated by foreign development
agencies.<br><br>Another and related key part of the anti-government
destabilization strategy in Nicaragua has been&nbsp;US government
funded "democracy strengthening" organizations, a constant feature of
US and European destabilization efforts around the world. The two most
prominent of these in Nicaragua are Etica y Transparencia and IPADE.
All through 2008, these two organizations deliberately set out to
create an atmosphere of tension and suspicion&nbsp;by questioning the
legitimacy of the independent electoral authority. <br><br>Ever since
the FSLN government took office in January 2007 these two outfits and
other non-governmental organizations have accused the government of
being repressive. Etica y Transparencia has taken part in opposition
marches accusing the government of being a dictatorship. IPADE has
organized conferences in which participants, like Mexico's right wing
ex-President Vicente Fox,&nbsp;supposedly invited to discuss democracy
have deliberately criticized the FSLN-led Nicaraguan government
along sectarian party lines.<br><br>Media lies about the latest local elections<br><br>This
overall constellation of actors, right-wing politicians, opposition
controlled news media, politically sectarian NGOs, and politically
biased "electoral observation" outfits,&nbsp; is openly supported and
encouraged by foreign governments. The most important&nbsp;are the US
government and some European Union governments. That has been the
overall opposition bloc - not just the right wing political parties -
facing the FSLN-led government coalition in the latest municipal
elections.<br><br>Three main lies have been set running in the national
and international media in relation to these latest elections. Firstly,
that there were no election observers. In fact, there were around 150
electoral system professionals representing the electoral authorities
of countries throughou Latin America. These observers have publicly
ratified&nbsp;these latest elections in Nicaragua as having been free,
fair and exceptionally well organized.<br><br>The second lie is that
the government in Nicaragua controls the electoral authority - thus
implicitly reinforcing the lie about the electoral observers by
alleging that the "government rejected electoral observation". The
Supreme Electoral Council is an independent power in Nicaragua and is
made up of seven magistrates. Three magistrates are from the right wing
opposition and three magistrates from the FSLN. The Council president
currently is an individual not formally identified with any political
party - but regularly accused of favouring the FSLN by the opposition
and its fawning media.<br><br>The third big lie is that the violence in
Managua following the elections was instigated by the FSLN.&nbsp; In
fact the violence in Managua on Monday November 10th resulted directly
from a group of several hundred PLC supporters led by&nbsp; Eduardo
Montealegre who attacked individuals and deliberately provoked
confrontations along the route of their march over a brief period
before riot police arrived to bring things under control.<br><br>Subsequently
all day Monday 10th, much of Tuesday 11th and also today Wednesday
12th, groups of Montealegre supporters have roamed Managua provoking
incidents. In one incident, implausibly disavowed by Montealegre, an
FSLN radio station journalist - of Radio Nuevo Ya - was stabbed seven times&nbsp; was ambushed
and had his vehicle set ablaze. Before the elections, by far the most
serious incident in an otherwise uneventful period prior to the
election was the shocking murder of an FSLN activist by a PLC supporter.<br><br>But
in the international media, Monday's violence was portrayed as
widespread rioting by thousands of outraged right-wing supporters.
Spain's centre-right El Pais newspaper called for foreign governments
to intervene. As usual, the lazy, ill-informed international media
campaign is based on the false reporting of Nicaragua's local right
wing media. The psy-ops nuts and bolts tweak and glint like an engine
running with the hood up. The manipulation and deceitful distortion is
absolutely blatant, just as it is in coverage of events in Venezuela or
Bolivia.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Perhaps it may seem strange that so much
outrage and uproar should be caused by some local elections that do
little to change the balance of local government power in Nicaragua.
But beneath the superficial irrelevance, these elections have changed
fundamentally the configuration of electoral options in Central
America. Now the FSLN are in a position to win the 2011 presidential
elections outright - even against a united right wing opposition.<br><br>After
the defeat of the Venezuelan government constitutional proposals
in the referendum at the end of 2007, it seemed reasonable&nbsp;for
the Right in Latin America to hope to recoup some of the ground lost.
The local elections in Nicaragua have ruined this US and allied
government script for 2008. In Bolivia, the Evo Morales government
defeated opposition attempts to provoke civil war and has managed to
push through a new constitution for the country, albeit somewhat
weakened. <br><br>Venezuela
holds local elections on November 23rd with Chavez supporters likely to
do better than expected earlier in the year. In March 2009, all the
signs are that the left-wing FMLN in El Salvador
will win the presidential elections there. That will bring an end to
almost twenty years of domination by the extreme right-wing ARENA
party. Now, Nicaragua's FSLN led government can look forward to
defeating a united right wing electoral coalition in 2011 and so win a
second five year term so as to consolidate its current programme and
become the natural party of government.<br><br>All
that explains why there has been so much controversy around the latest
local elections in Nicaragua. This defeat for the right wing may
well&nbsp;lead them to ever more desperate extremes as they try and
prevent the steady drift of support towards the FSLN government. It is
going to be a long and difficult three years before those presidential
elections at the end of 2011.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
