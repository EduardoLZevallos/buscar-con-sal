<p><a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/4728"><em>Versión en español</em></a></p>

<p>Having lost Eurasia, US and allied elites have prioritized Latin America and the Caribbean, seeking to re-consolidate control of the region’s resources. They work to destroy political movements and leaders who defend their countries’ impoverished majorities against the West’s neocolonial agenda. In particular, Western elites work with local allies to eliminate expressions of national sovereignty. From within, they undermine and co-opt governments and institutions. Externally they deploy all kinds of financial, trade, media and diplomatic aggression as well as military intimidation.</p>

<p>These fundamental processes drove political and economic events in the region through the 1990s. They have done so ever more intensively since the failed 2002 coup against President Chavez in Venezuela and the successful coup against Haiti’s President Jean Bertrand Aristide in 2004. US National Security Adviser John Bolton’s <a href="https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/1846768002">recent condemnation</a> of the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela marks another explicit escalation of a process already well-advanced under President Obama. This Western offensive to recolonize Latin America and the Caribbean has highlighted the complex link between false foreign news coverage and domestic political control in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>Recent Western media attacks on <a href="https://youtu.be/8CHMFhAQ_iI">Max Blumenthal and Kerry Ann Mendoza</a> over their coverage of a <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/4331">US writer embedded</a> in Nicaragua’s political opposition categorically exposed that reality. Western journalists and editors were more concerned about a coup-mongering activist-writer <a href="https://www.thecanary.co/exclusive/2018/10/04/longtime-friend-of-deported-guardian-reporter-speaks-out-on-their-work-inhabiting-the-role-of-a-foreign-agent-of-imperialism/">legitimately deported</a> home to the US, than tens of pro-government journalists <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/3602">almost burned alive</a> by the opposition terror gangs he supported. These Western journalists share their role as intellectual managers with <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/The-Anti-Democratic-Anti-Intellectual-West-20170122-0022.html">universit</a><a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/The-Anti-Democratic-Anti-Intellectual-West-20170122-0022.html">y academics</a> and managers of non-governmental organizations.</p>

<p>Across the political spectrum, they pose as trustworthy guides, offering false maps of the psychological warfare terrain they aim to control. John Bolton’s counterfactual attack on the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela as a “troika of tyranny” exposed the pernicious class role of these self-interested Western media, academic and <a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2018/08/26/purpose-goes-to-latin-america-part-ii/">NGO managers</a>, who attack those countries’ governments using the same false information and deliberate omission as Bolton. A few recent examples related to Nicaragua make this clear.</p>

<p>Sociology professor <a href="https://theconversation.com/migrant-money-could-be-keeping-nicaraguas-uprising-alive-102154">Benjamin Waddell</a> falsely claims the Sandinista government has banned protest demonstrations. In fact, the Nicaraguan government has applied its own existing laws to match public order norms in North America and Europe. Public protests in Nicaragua now have to get permission from the police agreeing the time and route of their demonstration. Before that measure, opposition extremists persistently used firearms during demonstrations to provoke the casualties they needed to be able to claim lethal repression.</p>

<p>Waddell himself mentions casualties include “a 16-year-old boy caught in the crossfire between government forces and demonstrators.” A more honest account would have noted the independent parliamentary <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/comision_verdad_justicia_24-8-2018.pdf">Truth Commission’s reports</a> showing how the briefing Waddell cites includes well over a hundred deaths entirely unconnected to the protests and other alleged deaths completely undocumented. Nor does Waddell acknowledge <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/3546">independent reports</a> confirming that around two thirds of the fatalities have been shown to be either Sandinista supporters or innocent bystanders.</p>

<p>Across the political aisle, <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/washington-imposes-new-sanctions-against-venezuela-and-cuba/5658814">Bill van Auken</a> explains about President Ortega “Until now, Washington has exhibited a certain ambivalence toward the government of the Sandinista leader, who returned to power in 2007 on the basis of an economic program geared to the interests of Nicaraguan and foreign capital.” You read that right. Auken claims the US government will no longer tolerate a Nicaraguan regime geared to the interests of foreign capital. Similar self-contradictory irrationality bedevils ill-informed foreign coverage of Nicaragua.</p>

<p align="left">Other writers display their lazy ignorance via outright falsehoods. Academic <a href="https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Jenny_Pearce">Jenny Pearce</a>, commenting on the attempted coup in Nicaragua <a href="https://www.redpepper.org.uk/whats-left-in-latin-america/">claims</a> President Ortega “responded to protests at corruption and authoritarianism by unleashing para-police forces against protesters”. In fact, Daniel Ortega quickly responded to the initial extremely violent opposition protests by calling for national dialogue with mediation by the Catholic Church. Compounding her falsehood, Pearce also claims “most” of the coup promoters in Nicaragua “are neither counter-revolutionaries nor right-wing.” To the complete contrary, the coup promoters were all either well known right wing leaders or else foreign-funded groups long openly allied with them.</p>

<p align="left">The coup promoters quickly and openly identified themselves: Piero Coen, Nicaragua’s wealthiest individual; Micheal Healy a manager for Colombian agribusiness interests; the private sector employers’ organization COSEP; fascist Catholic bishops and right wing Nicaraguan political parties; US funded NGOs and media all closely associated with the US allied MRS political party; a foreign-funded rural workers group; and very small numbers of unrepresentative, foreign-supported students. MRS leaders openly accept funding from the US authorities and lobby for support from fascist politicians like Marco Rubio and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. But Jenny Pearce thinks these components “express a democratising, ethical, equitable, environment and land-protecting politics from below.”</p>

<p align="left">Another respected progressive academic, Belgium's Eric Toussaint overtakes Pearce’s counterfactual analysis with deliberate outright disinformation. Toussaint’s <a href="http://www.cadtm.org/local/cache-vignettes/L640xH398/arton16759-c69b8.jpg?1541001177">latest attack starts</a> with the <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/opinion/Nicaragua-Next-in-Line-for-Regime-Change-20180421-0014.html">long debunked falsehood,</a> that Nicaragua’s proposed Social Security reform was dictated by the IMF. The reverse is true. The Nicaraguan government defended workers and pensioners against IMF proposals. That is why the government proposal was rejected by the right wing coup promoters who cleverly used mass manipulation via social networks and right wing media to mobilize ill-informed protesters. By contrast, Toussaint has no excuse for ignoring the <a href="http://tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/2500">clearly documented</a> reality.</p>

<p align="left">Among much other disinformation Toussaint, defends sinister individuals like Francisca Ramirez and Medardo Mairena who in recent years, regularly organized often violent roadblocks to protest against Nicaragua’s proposed inter-oceanic canal. In retrospect, they were <a href="https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:43470-investigan-explosion-en-comunidad-la-fonseca-nueva-guinea">clearly preparing</a> for the recent coup attempt. During the attempted coup between April and July, Ramirez, Mairena and their violent thugs operated roadblocks intimidating and extorting local farmers and business people while ensuring free transit for their own supporters’ farm animals and produce. Medardo Mairena, earlier expelled from Costa Rica accused of people trafficking, now awaits trial for the <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/3672">murder of four police officers</a> and a school teacher on July 12th just as the failed coup attempt was ending.</p>

<p>Right or Left, Western apologists for the attempted coup in Nicaragua cover up what is self-evident. The US authorities and their allies attack the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela precisely because they have democratized their societies and economies against Western and allied elite interests. This year’s failed coup attempt in Nicaragua <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/4723">faithfully copied</a> the serial coup attempts in Venezuela since 2013. All these attacks have been organized and timed to facilitate US government sanctions aimed at regime change. Currently, on Nicaragua the big lie is that the crisis continues, when in fact it has been over since July and life quickly returned to complete normality.</p>

<p>Recycling falsehoods promoting the US regime change agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean corrupts democratic debate in the West and creates an alibi for the phony, anti-democratically framed elections of US allies like Brazil’s fascist ideologue Jair Bolsonaro. Clear-sighted anti-imperialist writers like Max Blumenthal, Kerry Ann Mendoza and <a href="https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2018-10-30/bolsonaro-is-a-monster-engineered-by-our-media/">Jonathan Cook</a>, among many others, repeatedly make this same point. Untruthful foreign affairs coverage by the Western intellectual, NGO and media class, destroys democratic debate at home, to the benefit of NATO country elites. Western coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean, especially Nicaragua and Venezuela now, demonstrates that reality over and over again.</p>
