      <p>The NATO system of hypocrisy and sadism is matched by a
financial
economy dependent on taxpayer-funded bailouts, crude covert
market-rigging and money laundering of all kinds. The NATO regimes'
growing criminality marks the accelerating pace of their decline.
Child-killer-and-family-destroyer-in-Chief Barack Obama seems fated to
preside over a decisive phase in the continuing decline of the United
States relative to its global competitors. <br>
      <br>
The latest event
marking the particular decline of US political and economic influence
in the world took place in Central America on Sunday May 22nd.
Presidents Mauricio Funes of El Salvador, Alvaro Colom of Guatemala and
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua met in the Nicaraguan capital Managua to
formally recognise the government of President Porfirio Lobo of
Honduras. These Central American Presidents announced the normalization
of relations with Honduras permitting the normal working of the Central
American Integration System and the reintegration of Honduras into the
Organization of American States.<br>
      <br>
This historic regional
diplomatic breakthrough resulted from months of discussions and
negotiations between President Lobo and ex-President Manuel Zelaya over
how to reconcile the demands of the Honduran resistance led by Manuel
Zelaya and the position of Lobo's hitherto illegitimate regime. The
negotiations were decisively facilitated and backed by Presidents Juan
Manuel Santos of Colombia and Hugo Chavez Fr&iacute;as of Venezuela.
They took
place against clear displeasure and low-key resistance from the US
State Department.<br>
      <br>
Historic significance<br>
      <br>
The peaceful
return of former President Zelaya to Honduras after almost two years of
enforced exile may only be a first flawed step towards healing the deep
constitutional wounds caused in Honduras by the military coup of June
28th 2009. But, regardless of events over the next couple of years
prior to new elections in Honduras in 2013,&nbsp; the move towards
peaceful
reconciliation has very deep political and economic significance. It
takes place when Latin American and Caribbean governments are due to
meet in Caracas in July to form a new regional forum without the United
States and Canada. <br>
      <br>
That July meeting in Caracas may well
mark the beginning of the demise of the Organization of American
States. Politically, the leadership shown by Colombia and Venezuela to
resolve the Honduran crisis has few precedents, especially given the
deep ideological divisions between the two governments. It demonstrates
a growing awareness in Latin America that dependence on the US
government for leadership is counterproductive in terms of the region's
political and economic development. In terms of relations within the
region, the move by Colombia and Venezuela also sets a marker in
relation to the regional political dominance of Brazil. <br>
      <br>
The
political dilemma facing right-wing governments like those of Colombia
and Honduras &#8211; and, by implication Peru, Chile and Mexico &#8211; is that if
they do not cooperate with regional neighbours, all they can expect
from the United States is moral and increasingly irrelevant and
counterproductive military support. That still incipient political
dilemma is many times more acute from an economic perspective. One of
the key factors influencing the decision of the Lobo regime to
cooperate with the Colombian-Venezuelan initiative is the recognition
that Latin American economic growth can no longer depend on a strong US
economy or on potential new markets in Europe.</p>
      <p>The economic perspective<br>
      <br>
The recent Agreement of Association between the European Union and
Central America represents Central America's efforts to maximise
potential benefits of trade with the ancien regime North Atlantic
powers. However, for oil-import-dependent governments managing small
national economies, the prospect of another oil price shock is a
sobering reminder of the failure in terms of their economic development
of discredited, speaking-in-tongues free-market economics. The
corresponding success of the Venezuelan-led Petrocaribe framework,
guaranteeing regional countries oil and oil derivatives on
highly preferential terms, only emphasises the relative decline of US
regional economic leadership.<br>
      <br>
When Chile, Colombia, Mexico and
Per&uacute; recently signed a joint Free Trade Agreement on April 28th
this
year, they were responding to the challenges presented by Mercosur and
the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (ALBA), dominated by Brazil and
Venezuela respectively. All these initiatives respond&nbsp; in turn to
the increasing
trade importance to Latin America of China, India and South East Asia.
The normalization of the Central American Integration System is a
decisive move along the same lines by the countries of Central America.<br>
      <br>
Latin American and Caribbean nations are forging a common strategy with
different ideological variations on the same theme. They need to get
the best they can from existing commercial and financial relations with
North America and Europe. They also need to engage effectively with
rapidly growing markets in Asia. For both purposes they must integrate
regionally so as to negotiate and trade from a position of combined
strength.<br>
      <br>
Central America and the US<br>
      <br>
For Central
America the meeting in Managua on May 22nd was&nbsp; an encouraging
sequel
to the devastating Honduran coup of June 2009. It seems ever more
likely now that the coup will be seen as a kind of last stand by
Central America's repressive oligarchies against historical trends they
are ultimately powerless to resist. The dominant trend is the relative
political and economic decline of the United States and the
corresponding impact of global powers like Brazil and China. <br>
      <br>
That impact entails far-reaching regional diplomatic, commercial and
financial adjustments that herald the end of the North American and
European ancien regime. Those adjustments reflect a massive
continent-wide social and cultural emancipation, a phenomenon far
deeper and broader than the glib &#8220;pink tide&#8221; confection of NATO country
propaganda media assets. North American and European politicians will
continue for a few more years to parrot ridiculous false beliefs in
relation to their non-existent moral authority and their rotten-corrupt
democracy.<br>
      <br>
But in Central America and elsewhere those absurd
claims will receive less and less respect and attention. Perhaps for
another ten to fifteen years, the US, Canada and their European allies
will continue to exert gangster-like extortion on the very weak Central
American countries as they have always done. But their ability to do so
will diminish as Central America integrates both inwardly and
regionally.<br>
      <br>
The threat of military intervention, of punitive
immigration measures against Central American migrants in the US, of
economic sanctions, of commercial and financial skulduggery &#8211; all these
will diminish as Central America consolidates. That consolidation,
effectively halted by the Honduran military coup, was boosted by two
declarations at the May 22nd meeting in Managua. One declaration
confirmed moves towards a regional customs union. The other confirmed a
range of measures on security cooperation and organised crime.</p>
      <p>Central America and Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
The meeting was definitive in fixing the determination of the
Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan and Salvadoran authorities - the CA-4
bloc - to advance towards integration at their own pace. As the CA-4
countries' integration progresses, pressure will increase on Costa Rica
and Panama to integrate as well. For Nicaragua, the May 22nd meeting
confirms the abysmal failure of Costa Rican diplomacy to isolate the
Nicaraguan government over the dispute in relation to the two
countries' common border at the delta of the Rio San Juan.<br>
      <br>
The
meeting categorically prioritized peaceful diplomacy, assigning the
armed violence that characterized the Honduran coup the status of an
illegitimate aberration. For President Porfirio Lobo, the price of
regaining legitimacy has been some degree of acceptance of the demands
of Manuel Zelaya. By defending Manuel Zelaya while facilitating a
successful political deal, President Daniel Ortega has enormously
strengthened his own government's legitimacy in the region&nbsp; as
well as
that of the Venezuelan and Cuban led ALBA economic bloc.<br>
      <br>
The
United States government and its allies will continue in their constant
efforts to discredit the Nicaraguan government as illegitimate. Once
back in Honduras, Manuel Zelaya will face ruthless and relentless
opposition from the US government backed Honduran oligarchy. But
Nicaragua's forthcoming elections in November this year are likely to
deal a further blow to the regional credibility of the US, Canadian and
European governments. At some point, those governments are bound to
consider some kind of military aggression to compensate for their
categorical loss of political and economic influence in the region.</p>
