<br />
<em><strong>In order to defeat the Empire's attempt to classify, before hand, our elections of November 7th as fraudulent, it is necessary to do a little history. They say Confucius said: study the past if you want to forecast the future.</strong></em></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="" height="240" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/nicaraguan_flag.jpg.html" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" width="370" /></p>

<p>The independence in 1821 of the so-called Central American provinces was the last to be enacted in Guatemala, then the headquarters of the Captaincy General, once the other Latin American countries completed or were about to do so, their great liberating feats. It is important to note that not all the independentistas were ideologically equal. After Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the liberators separated into two great currents: liberals and conservatives. Bolívar, Hidalgo, Morelos, Artigas, Morazán, who, we can say now, belonged to the left wing of the independence struggle were betrayed, shot or assassinated by the conservatives. Any parallels with our current history?</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and the United States, like hunting vultures, followed the course of the libertarian battles. It did not take long for James Monroe, president of the United States of America in 1823, to coin the phrase that made him famous among the Washington elites of that time: America for the Americans. In its growth, the United States had three stages: expansionism toward the west and the north, assassinating all the natives of those regions, the purchasing of Louisiana in 1803 and Alaska in 1867 and the annexation of the south: Texas, 1836; Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 1848. As we know it, the Yankee empire formally began with the intervention in the anti-colonial war in Cuba and the Philippines between 1898 and 1902). From the mercenary invasion of the CIA in Guatemala in 1954, to the Bolivian coup in 2019, imperialism has not stopped trying to annex Latin America for itself, whether militarily, politically or economically. Those of the right and the ultra-right accuse the peoples of the worn-out discourse that imperialism is to blame for everything, even the flight of a fly. The imperialism of the United States of America is not an entelechy, a label; it is the imperial vision of the owners of money, power and weapons, including nuclear weapons in that country. They are the ones who want to dominate the world and for that they impose the dollar as a reference currency, they have eight hundred military bases around the world and overthrow governments that are not aligned with them.</p>

<p>Having described in a synthetic manner the hegemonic obsession of imperialism, hence that of the right and the extreme right in the United States and the rest of the world, it would be naive to think that they are going to give free rein to the electoral process. Although the members of the Internal Front of the New Contra are subject to a judicial process for crimes that are typified in Law 1055, which establishes that those who lead or finance a coup d'état, who incite foreign interference, who request foreign military interventions, organize with financing from foreign powers in order to carry out acts of terrorism and destabilization, or propose and manage economic, commercial and financial operations and blockades against the country and its institutions, will be considered traitors to the Motherland and therefore will not be eligible to participate in popular elections, without prejudice to the corresponding criminal actions established within the Penal Code of the Republic of Nicaragua; the leaders, who are outside the country, whether self-exiled or fugitives from justice, operating mainly from Costa Rica, the United States and Spain, continue the designs of the strategists of the US State Department and CIA, with their funding apparatus, USAID and NED, in order to declare the next elections illegal.</p>

<p>On September 25 the digital libel of Carlos Fernando Chamorro Barrios, in Costa Rica, reported that a forum titled: Elections 7/11 in Nicaragua: an Illegitimate Process, was organized by the Arias Foundation and led by journalist Tifani Roberts. From this moment, the electoral process of next November 7 is considered illegitimate, despite the fact that it is subject to the constitutional laws of the Republic and sanctioned by the Supreme Electoral Council, the legitimate body in charge of the electoral process. In that forum, the options that the international community has to pressure Daniel Ortega and Rosario (Dixit) were raised to allow free elections in the country.</p>

<p>“The sanctions must continue, but in a smart way. Not for Daniel Ortega and his children to understand, but for the power structures of the Frente Sandinista: there is no future with Ortega and Murillo. Not for them, not for Nicaragua”, said Cynthia Arnson, Director of the Latin America Program of the “Woodrow Wilson International Center”.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnson's intentions are clear, transparent like water: to provoke division within the FSLN like the one that occurred in 1995, in which those who denied the Sandinista ideology, brilliantly structured by Carlos Fonseca Amador, who applied dialectic to the historical interpretation of the ideals of Sandino, Marx, Che, Fidel and Christianity, in order to forge the ideology that has guided the true FSLN since 1961; those apostates resigned from the FSLN to form a Spanish type social democratic movement, led by Sergio Ramírez, Dora Téllez, Tinoco, Torres, to mention the best known.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnson accused the government of murdering 300 people in 2018, and of jailing the entire political leadership of the New Contra. She complained that, despite the sanctions, the threat to approve the Renacer Act and the NICA Act, none of these actions have had any effect to stop the fraudulent electoral process of November.<br />
Usually these types of analysts, from their vantage point, do not see beyond their navels. They do not understand that, in their obsession with defenestrating Comandante Daniel and Comrade Rosario, the FSLN is not just a four-letter acronym, it is a popular movement and a political party with the support of 70 percent of Nicaraguans; If Nicaragua has 6.6 million inhabitants, 4.6 million citizens favor it.</p>

<p>Jennie Lincoln, senior specialist at the Carter Center for Latin America and the Caribbean, recommends in a special manner, documenting electoral fraud, “in order to be able to declare with evidence, the November trap”, and that this forces the Government to “face its responsibility; to suffer the evidence of their defeat in that process. We must ensure that the world does not forget what is happening in Nicaragua, where there has to be a brutal change, in order to recover democracy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lincoln assumes that the elections on November 7 will be a fraud one month from now! Either she's blatantly lying or she's a fortune teller.</p>

<p>For its part, within the framework of the United Nations General Assembly, which took place in New York on September 27, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, the United States, France and the United Kingdom signed a declaration in which they point out that in Nicaragua “the necessary conditions” do not exist to hold “free and fair” elections, which calls into question their “legitimacy.”</p>

<p>Let us have no doubt that the unpresentable Luis Almagro will pull the strings so that countries related to the Empire apply to Nicaragua the Democratic Charter of the OAS, which says in more or less words, that a candidate can win democratically in free elections, but then become a "dictator.” And who decides this? Neither more nor less than the intellectuals, journalists, political analysts, and of course the member governments of the OAS. But what characterizes this whole host of notables: that they are all from the right and the ultra-right, vassals of the Empire.</p>

<p>A note from the Sputnik agency dated September 21, revealed that the FSLN would win the general elections on November 7 with 63.9% of the votes. 2 million nine hundred thousand men and women will vote for the FSLN and its candidates for the Presidency and Vice-presidency Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Rosario Murillo Zambrana, respectively.<br />
The best weapon to defeat the Empire at this time, including of course its lackeys from within and outside the country, is to go out to vote en masse on November 7 for Daniel and Rosario. It is our task as FSLN militants to convince those who still doubt that they must vote for the only option that guarantees us to remain free, independent, sovereign, and democratic. And that option is the FSLN. Let us remind them of the horrific years of neoliberal politics of Violeta, Arnoldo and Bolaños, in which they took away our dignity as human beings.</p>

<p>If we go out to vote en masse, even above what the polls predict, we will have defeated Imperialism. In no country in the world can one speak of electoral fraud when millions and millions of citizens vote for the candidate of their choice. It is impossible to prove or use electoral fraud when, out of every ten citizens, eight or nine vote for the party of their choice. And, I repeat, that is the Sandinista National Liberation Front. That is our task.</p>
