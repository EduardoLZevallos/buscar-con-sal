with Margarita Murillo, coordinator of popular resistance to the
military coup in Honduras in the country's north western region.</span><br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Margarita
Murillo has been deeply involved in the rural workers movement in
Honduras for nearly 40 years. As a girl she took part in the national
march for agrarian reform of 1973 which met with fierce repression
including the notorious Los Horcones massacre in which 12 rural workers
were murdered. Back then, Margarita experienced for the first time the
brutality and abuse that have always characterized the Honduran
military and police. From that time to the present she became a
well-known leader in the rural workers' organizations in her country.
In 1987 she was forcibly disappeared&nbsp; by the army. The abuse and
torture to which she was subjected left her with damage to her spine
that affects her to this day. More fortunate than other victims of the
Honduran death squads of that time, after more than three weeks she was
presented to the courts and set free. She managed to leave Honduras and
went into exile. In Cuba, the damage to her spine was operated on and
eventually she returned to Honduras in secret. The amnesty arranged by
the administration of President Rafael Callejas made it possible for
her to return to a normal life working with rural communities in the
north of the country. Currently she is Secretary General of the Social
Forum of the Sula Valley. Margarita and her colleagues in the popular
movement have been at the forefront of organizing resistance to the
military coup in Honduras in the north western part of the country. As
a sadistic measure of repression aimed at intimidating her and her
family, the army forcibly disappeared her son Samuel, aged 23, on July
26th abducting him from the family's home in Marañon just south of San
Pedro Sula. His whereabouts are still unknown. Her husband Oscar was
wounded in the leg by a&nbsp;.3030 calibre bullet fired by the army
during one of their attacks on peaceful demonstrators at the Choloma
bridge between San Pedro and Puerto Cortes. In this interview Margarita
talks to <a href="index.html">Tortilla con Sal</a> about popular resistance to the military coup and the prospects of a settlement to the conflict in the short term.</span><br><br>TcS
: We are with Margarita Murillo, one of the leaders in the north
western part of the country of the opposition front against the coup
regime in Honduras, mostly in the area around the city of San Pedro
Sula. Now we are at around 55 days of struggle against the coup, how do
you see the development of the protests and demonstrations and the
resistance at a national level and, of course, most of all in your own
area?<br><br>MM : Well, I think the resistance undertaken by the
Honduran people against the coup d'etat via the National Front of
Popular Resistance is permanent and irreversible and by people in the
northern zone has been daily, permanent. From June 28th to date we
haven't failed a single day carrying out activities against the coup
d'etat and every day we meet, every day we set out on the marches we
see people increasingly joining in. People are becoming more aware, are
joining in, accepting that this was indeed a coup d'etat. People are
clear that it was not a coup d'etat exclusively against President
Manuel Zelaya Rosales, but rather a coup d'etat against all of the
Honduran people. Because the actions the President was implementing was
in favour of the Honduran people and, with the coup, the people once
more remain headless, without representation in the country.<br><br>TcS
: Can you talk a bit about the specific actions you know about
directly. For example, I understand you and your colleagues in the
Front where you are working, you are organizing a very complicated area
in Choloma.<br><br>MM : Yes. Along the way, during all the time that
has passed since the coup d'etat, we have carried out various
activities. First on June 28th we were leading the coordination of the
Consultative Vote. We were in the Central Park of San Pedro&nbsp; and
we made sure not a single voting box was captured by the army. Not like
in the rest of the voting centres around San Pedro Sula where the
majority of voting boxes were burned or sabotaged. They didn't let the
people vote. We moved the boxes to the Central Park and as they got
filled&nbsp;we took them away. After that we were in the Park in San
Pedro Sula for five days running and there they broke us up violently
with tear gas, gunshots, stones, truncheons, people in prison and
people beaten up. But the resistance didn't end there. We followed a
strategic plan to follow up what to do after the coup d'etat and we
carried on doing marches through the populous barrios of San Pedro Sula
so as to try and inform the population that there had been a coup
d'etat, who had carried it out and what were the reasons for that coup
d'etat.<br><br>When we began doing those marches in those most
populated parts of San Pedro Sula, people joined with us. There were
activities in which we would leave the labour union offices with a
couple of hundred people and on returning to the Central Park there
would be fifteen or twenty or even thirty thousand people accompanying
us from the barrios. That gave us the chance to know that the Honduran
people were aware there had been a coup d'etat and that it was a coup
d'etat against the Honduran people.<br><br>After that we began the
process of internal organization of the National Front of Popular
Resistance in the northern zone. We have organized in the
municipalities and we have organized the municipalities of Choloma,
Santa Cruz de Yojoa, Potrerillos, Villanueva, La Lima and San Pedro
Sula. And we have also divided the great city of San Pedro Sula into
different sectors, like Chamelecón, Cofradía, Rivera Hernandez, Bordos
and barrios like Soncer, Medina and Concepción. In all those barrios we
have organized nuclei of the National Resistance Front and it is these
that are helping us.<br><br>What happened then? Well, after we had set
up all the structures for the Front in these almost 60 days of the the
coup, we then began taking over the highways. And one of the main
highways is at the Choloma Bridge over the River Choloma in that
municipality. We have been occupying that bridge and that is a main
artery because it leads to the port zone of Puerto Cortes through which
comes fuel and raw materials. And we have been occupying that zone
consecutively for many weeks. Then on the last Friday - because we
occupied it almost always Thursdays and Fridays - we were brutally
repressed by the army. People were wounded, some with gunshots and
there are still people in the Catarina Olivas hospital (in San Pedro
Sula) people were imprisoned and beaten mercilessly<br><br>TcS : There were reports of at least one woman who was brutally raped...<br><br>MM
: Yes. A woman teacher was raped and not just raped but they put a
truncheon in this woman's vagina and that is a monstrous thing to do.
In fact it was two women who were raped. And the women who were taken
away to the police station were mercilessly beaten. Some women were
beaten even worse than were the men who were captured. Some people,
including&nbsp; those with gunshot wounds, are still in the Catarina
Olivas hospital.<br><br>TcS : How many people were shot?<br><br>MM :
One is there with a gunshot wound. But of the others there are three
people who were beaten unconscious with truncheons and there are the
two women rape victims. Apart from them are all the people with facial
and head wounds and wounds to the back. That clearance by the army was
truly brutal and I describe it in those terms because we had been
negotiating with the army and the police. They turned up to clear us
away and said they wanted to talk to the coordinator of the movement
and so I went to talk to them. As we were negotiating they told me,
"Right, we give you until 12 noon to clear the street". So we said
there was no problem, we were ready to withdraw and we negotiated on
the basis that we were going to move away and they asked us to clean up
the rubbish all our people had left and to clear away the big stones we
had thrown across the road as a barricade. So we agreed and I told them
that yes, before we left we would leave the road clear just as we had
found it.<br><br>When I turned to go and organize people to clear the
road and withdraw so we could get out of there without any violence,
that was when they began to attack. I hadn't gone even ten feet from
where we had been negotiating&nbsp; when they began to attack. The
first tear gas bomb fell at my back after we had been talking, after I
had gone about ten feet to organize people to withdraw the first tear
gas canister landed at my back about the height of my rucksack.<br><br>So
it was they who broke the deal we had agreed that we were going to
withdraw. And there is a recording and a video of me negotiating with
the police so they wouldn't break us up violently and there is the
recording of when I said to the police chief, "we're going to withdraw,
we're going to clear the road but give us a chance while we do that
work and don't set the army on us. Don't let them break us up violently
while we are sorting out the road." But in fact they didn't give us a
chance but rather immediately began the repression.<br><br>Afterwards
they said they carried out the repression because our people had begun
throwing stones. But that isn't true. Our people are disciplined
because we don't put louts to lead our marches. Our people are
organized from different labour unions - not just layabouts. They march
in the streets to protest against the coup but they are far from being
people with nothing better to do. They are organized. And it is not
true they started throwing stones. We were going to organize to
withdraw and they were the ones who started the repression.<br><br>Of
course, then people were - so as to allow the women and young people
and children&nbsp; there to withdraw - people wanted to stop the
repression, something that was impossible because our people are
unarmed. They have no weapons. And the army opened fire with
high-calibre weapons. Not rubber bullets but real bullets. And the
repression was extreme. Armoured cars, rifles, truncheons, shields,
tear gas. There was even an explosion that we believe was a grenade
that fell in the middle of the highway.<br><br>TcS : Do you think the
experience of that day in Choloma indicates a change in the level of
confrontation between the coup regime and the resistance?<br><br>MM :
Yes I think that is the lesson. They are telling us something like
"Right, if you continue with the demonstrations then this is how we are
going to repress them." The repression was very large scale. So we
think the repression is going to get progressively more intense each
time we take to the streets. We are certainly aware that the coup
regime is readily disposed to repress the people. We have no illusions
on that. We know they are cruel just from the fact that they grab women
and rape them. Practically in public they grab then and take them off
some way away from the road. From that we understand all too well that
the repression is going to be even more criminal from now on. <br><br>Now,
we are also conscious that the repression will continue, will be twice
as bad, but we are also well aware that if we stop venturing onto the
streets the coup regime will consolidate itself more. So we are not
thinking of stopping the struggle. We are going to go on. We are going
to stay in the streets. We're going to continue leading this struggle
until the coup regime concedes power to the constitutional President of
Honduras.<br><br>TcS : And how do you see the role of President Manuel Zelaya now and his behaviour up until now?<br><br>MM
: I think the President of the Republic has been very objective trying
to manage this via peaceful means. He's been very objective in that
sense. He has accepted returning to Honduras under the Arias Plan. But
we see the Arias Plan as in practice a plan completely against the
Honduran people, apart from the restitution of Manuel Zelaya Rosales,
and that is what they are refusing to accept. But even so we see that
the President has been more than willing in the negotiations. And also
we have much more respect for his courage in maintaining that position
up until now and refusing other kinds of negotiations. We think he is a
bulwark at this point in the struggle and our Honduran people continue
leading their struggle in the hope that President Manuel Zelaya Rosales
is going to be reinstated.<br><br>But also the Honduran people are
firmly convinced that in reinstating Manuel Zelaya Rosales we are going
to go ahead with the National Constituent Assembly which is the great
objective that the Honduran people have set ourselves. There has been a
rupture of the constitutional order and in violating the constitutional
order the only thing appropriate is a Constituent Assembly. It's
impossible to go back to governing a country that is ungovernable as a
result of the constitutional rupture.<br><br>TcS :&nbsp; And what do you and your colleagues think, Margarita, of the electoral issue?<br><br>MM
: We think, and precisely last Sunday in an assembly of 500
representatives from different organizations in the department of
Cortes, we have very precise objectives. One is the short term
objective of reinstating President Manuel Zelaya Rosales. Second is to
arrive at a Constituent Assembly. And three is a new constitution for
the Republic. And we think that if at this moment Manuel Zelaya Rosales
does not return to the country before the beginning of the electoral
process we think there should not be any elections.<br><br>TcS : In other words, before September 1st...<br><br>MM
: Before September 1st.....There cannot be elections. And why can there
not be elections? Because those elections are being run under a coup
regime and we cannot accept elections run by the coup regime - firstly.
Also, we are against and could well find ourselves against the holding
of general elections even with the reinstatement of Manuel Zelaya
Rosales because that would be to consolidate the coup regime for next
year. Because the party candidates running at the moment are
instigators of the coup regime. In the case of Pepe Lobo and Elvin
Santos. They are coup supporters. So our people right now have no
electoral alternative and if we ourselves give Pepe Lobo the chance to
be President of the Republic, being a coup supporter, then the coup
d'etat will continue.<br><br>Suddenly one is hearing that it may be
possible to form alliances between the smaller parties so as to proceed
with the electoral process. We haven't looked at this in great depth
but even so we still think that to do so is wrong. It is wrong to go
ahead with general elections. But on that we think we still have a bit
of time to work out how to consolidate our ideas and see what we are
going to do after September 1st. <br><br>Really in the north-western
front we are waiting for September 1st for a concrete response on
President Zelaya's reinstatement and from that point on we can begin
another new strategic plan so as to know what to do afterwards during
those three months of the electoral process.<br><br>TcS : And do you
think Margarita that the resistance is going to be able to sustain the
consistency and coherence it has shown up until now indefinitely? Or is
there going to come a point in which the resistance dissolves?<br><br>MM
: We are working with firm objectives. It isn't a Resistance Front for
the short term but a National Resistance Front for the long haul
because we think the problems in Honduras are not going to be resolved
just by the arrival of President Zelaya or with a change of government
that general elections may bring about. We are organizing for the long
term. The National Front of Popular Resistance has its long terms
objectives and we have seen something in the people.<br><br>We see that
the people wants and is aware of being organized, And right now the
people has demonstrated the human solidarity which is something
impoverished people have, because it is poor people, the real people
that have been supporting the resistance. Sometimes, it annoys us and
sometimes it makes us laugh to hear the accusations they make, that the
coup regime makes, saying we get money from Chavez or that we get money
from the FARC&nbsp; and perhaps we don't have a cent. If we were
getting money from Chavez or the FARC we'd have plenty of money. But it
isn't true.<br><br>In the North as in the rest of the country, it is
the people that has sustained the resistance. The self-same organized
people that has given us clothing, shoes, food, water and even money so
we can mobilize and organize the Front at departmental level. Our
people has been so generous and willing. In every march we go on,
people in the barrios come out to give us refreshments and food. And
that is a sign that this Honduran people does want the resistance to
continue. Because if the people did not want us to continue in the
streets, they would not be helping us. But in fact the Honduran people
are helping us&nbsp; very firmly.<br><br>TcS : One last question Margarita, how important is the issue of impunity?<br><br>MM
: We as the Front think there is going to be a chance to fight to
ensure that all the crimes committed up until now after the coup will
not go unpunished. Obviously, right now none of the coup leaders have
been punished for all the crimes they have committed. But I do think
there is going to be a moment when we as a people, I not saying when
Manuel Zelaya Rosales arrives to restore constitutional order, rather
that we as a people are going to demand that the crimes committed up
until this point in the coup do not go unpunished. Because that would
be a slap in the face for the people as if all that has happened since
the coup gets treated as a forgotten time.<br><br>We know that all the
crimes that happened in Honduras for decades have gone unpunished
because until now we know of no punishment for those who abused human
rights during the 1980s, not one is in prison. So it has been the
custom for crimes to go unpunished.<br><br>Another of the questions we
reject with all our energy is to have as the person responsible for
State security in Honduras a murderer like Billy Joya who was one of
the murderers in the 1980s and now is in charge of security for the
Honduran States, for the Honduran government. For us, that means that
the doctrine of State Security&nbsp; that was implemented in the 1980s
once more returns and we think it returns with much more repression,
much more vigour, because the ones directing it are the very same ones
who have gone unpunished before. As a people we are certainly going to
demand that all the crimes committed do not go unpunished.<br><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
