On April 19th 2010 the state-owned production bank, Produzcamos,
commenced operations &#8211; an event long overdue as far as small and medium
producers in Nicaragua were concerned. Figures recently released about
its first eight months of operation show that the long awaited bank has
got off to a slow but steady start, although small producers across the
board in Nicaragua hope and expect to see greater availability of
affordable credit from the institution in the years to come.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
During the previous three neo-liberal governments (which ruled
Nicaragua between 1990 and 2006), constant calls for a public
production bank catering to the needs of the country&#8217;s small-scale
producers fell on deaf ears. That same sixteen-year period saw dramatic
changes in the type of loans available on the national market as
affordable credit all but dried up for small and medium producers while
credit opportunities for big business grew, as did the availability of
consumer credit. <br>
      <br>
Government and other statistics have shown over and over again that in
excess of 70% of jobs in Nicaragua are accounted for by micro, small
and medium production in the agricultural, commercial and industrial
sectors. During their time in power, however, Nicaragua&#8217;s right wing
politicians demonstrated no interest in encouraging the national
financial system to accommodate the needs of those sectors. <br>
      <br>
By 2006, though, public demand for a production bank was so strong that
all the main presidential candidates running in the 2006 national
elections (even the candidates representing a neo-liberal ideology like
Eduardo Montealegre and Jose Rizo) had no choice but to commit
themselves to policies favourable to affordable credit for small
producers. <br>
      <br>
After the FSLN came to power in January 2007 the government prioritized
the creation of a production bank and was able to push through initial
legislation, effectively installing Produzcamos as a legal state entity
in November 2007. <br>
      <br>
Depressingly, though, it took another two years before that legislative
process was completed due to the right wing opposition boycott strategy
that stymied progress in the National Assembly (where the right wing
have an overall majority) for most of 2008 and 2009. Evidently, the
opposition had no qualms about going back on the promises their
candidates had made on the campaign trail regarding the introduction of
affordable credit.<br>
      <br>
It was not, therefore, until mid-July 2009 that President Ortega was
able to swear in the members of the Produzcamos board of directors.
Nine months later, the bank opened it doors to the public with C$2,400
million in financial assets (approximately US$100 million) and branches
in most of Nicaragua&#8217;s main towns and cities.<br>
      <br>
The legislation concerning Nicaragua&#8217;s new production bank describes
the gap in the financial market that it is hoped Produzcamos will come
to fill as: &#8220;the need to provide credit to &#8230; micro, small and medium
producers within the agricultural, livestock farming, fishing,
forestry, artisan, industrial, agro-industrial, commercial and tourism
sectors with a special emphasis on [programs which] contribute to
greater food security &#8230; .&#8221; <br>
      <br>
And, although loans for all those sectors have been made available by
Produzcamos, General Manager Joaquin Lovo Tellez has described the
bank&#8217;s &#8220;raison d&#8217;etre&#8221; as being specifically &#8220;to stimulate the arable
and cattle farming sectors in Nicaragua.&#8221; Indeed during the bank&#8217;s
first eight months of operations 58% of loans issued went to these two
sectors. <br>
      <br>
During that initial period Produzcamos lent a total of C$315.1 million
(approximately US$15 million) to 4,423 clients around the country. Of
course this is not a very significant number of clients considering the
sort of demand that exists in the country - ASOMIF, the association of
commercial micro credit institutions in Nicaragua, lent money to more
than 290,000 clients in 2009. While frustrated that Produzcamos has
been unable to make more progress over a shorter period of time,
however, producer organizations say they are just happy (and relieved)
that Produzcamos has managed to get itself off the ground.<br>
      <br>
In statements to the national press Alvaro Fiallos, President of the
National Union of Farmers and Ranchers (UNAG), recently described the
bank&#8217;s progress so far as &#8220;slow but sure&#8221; saying that in Nicaragua
there is no other affordable credit option for small farmers, &#8220;so we
prefer that the bank gets off to a slow start &#8230; than for it [to rush]
to failure. <br>
      <br>
At present Produzcamos offers loans of between C$3,000 and C$22,000
(approx. US$140 to US$1,025) for micro and small producers while medium
producers can borrow up to C$5.4 million (US$250,000). <br>
      <br>
Interest rates on Produzcamos loans are between 8 and 12% depending on
the payback period, the size of the loan and the sector into which the
money is invested. <br>
      <br>
The main novelty Produzcamos has brought to the Nicaraguan financial
market is accessible, affordable credit of as little as C$3,000 for
micro producers (farmers who own less than a hectare of land, for
example) with the sort of interest rate you would expect to pay on a
bank loan, in this case just 8%. <br>
      <br>
Until now, loans of such small amounts have only been available from
the commercial micro credit institutions, which not only charge between
18% and 60% interest plus extortionate fines and other charges for late
payments, but also entail devastating consequences for clients who
default on their loans, including the expropriation of assets such as
land and other property. Until recent changes to national legislation
debtors even risked jail for defaulting on micro loans. <br>
      <br>
Unlike its micro credit counterparts, Produzcamos does not require
valuable assets as guarantees for micro loans. A small farmer who wants
to borrow from the bank, for example, simply needs to be able to prove
he owns his land and to provide two letters of recommendation
confirming that he, indeed, is a farmer. The bank&#8217;s representatives are
adamant, however, that, unlike in the 1980s, this time around the
Sandinista government will not contemplate lending again to producers
who have failed to pay previous loans.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
One of the obstacles the bank has stumbled across in terms of providing
agricultural credit since it began operations last year is that many
producers are unable to fulfil even these minimal prerequisites. It has
become clear that, despite the government&#8217;s massive efforts in this
field since 2007, a significant number of producers still do not have
their land titles in order. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
General Manager Lovo says the bank is developing a strategy to overcome
this problem in 2011 as a way of meeting this year&#8217;s more ambitious
aims to support small agricultural production.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
During 2011, he says, the bank hopes to lend over CS$1,200 million
(approx. US$54 million). Additionally, the Inter American Development
Bank (BID) has loaned Nicaragua C$440 million (US$20 million) to be
administered by Produzcamos as part of its small production credit
programs. This decision on behalf of the BID suggests that during its
first months in operation, Produzcamos has managed to inspire a high
level of trust among international financial institutions.&nbsp; <br>
