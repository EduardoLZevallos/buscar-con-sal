On December 5th the XXXIII Presidential Summit of the Central American
Integration System (SICA) took place in San Pedro Sula, northern
Honduras. The main purpose of the summit was to discuss the impact of
the international financial crisis on the region and approve a plan of
urgent measures aiming to reduce the damage caused by that crisis. <br>
<br>
Also during the summit <a href="http://www.sica.int/busqueda/documentos_recientes.aspx">a 59 point declaration</a> was signed by the
regional heads of state and government representatives. The declaration
includes agreements as diverse as : the continuation of the
negotiations
of a Central American Water Convention, the creation of a statistic
commission as part of the SICA institutional framework, the creation of
a special group to study the viability of an interregional rail network
and the decision to request SICA's Executive Committee to carry out an
analysis of the regional migrant protection program. <br>
<br>
The Presidents that took part in the meeting were Guatemala's Alvaro
Colom, El Salvador's Elias Saca, Honduras' Manuel Zelaya and
Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega. Belize was represented by First Minister
Gaspar Vega, Panamá, by Vice President Samuel Lewis and Costa
Rica, by Minister of External Commerce Marco Vinicio Ruiz. The
Dominican Republican, which is an associated member of SICA, was
represented by Vice President Rafael Albuquerque. <br>
<br>
Also present at the summit were representatives of SICA's observer
countries Germany, Spain, Italy, Taiwan, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and
Mexico as well as representatives of the Central American Parliament,
the Central American Court of Justice and the Central American Economic
Integration Bank (BCIE) among other institutions that form part of
SICA's institutional framework. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
During the conference Honduran President Manuel Zelaya handed over
SICA's
rotating presidency to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. As is the
organization's tradition, Ortega will hold the presidency for a period
of six months. At a press conference after the summit Ortega emphasized
the need to reinforce existing regional integration mechanisms and
create new ones as part of the "only possible solution to Central
America's problems" which he described as "the unity of our peoples." <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Financial crisis is
already
affecting Central American economies</span><br>
<br>
At a previous SICA Presidential Summit which took place on October 4th
earlier this year the region's presidents instructed the Department for
Central American Economic Integration (SIECA) (made up of the Council
of Economic Ministers, the Central American Monetary Council and the
Central American Economic Integration Bank, BCIE) to work together to
come up with a plan of action which would reduce the potentially
devasting effects of the international financial crisis. The finished
plan entitled, "<a href="http://www.minex.gob.gt/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=115&amp;func=startdown&amp;id=107">Plan
of Urgent Measures to Reduce the Impact of the International Financial
Crisis</a>" was presented at the December 5th summit and approved
by
the heads of state. <br>
<br>
It is expected that the worst of the global crisis on Central
America's small economies will begin to be felt forcefully in 2009.
Although, as the authors of the plan point out, "the financial crisis
has already begun to affect the real economies of developing countries.
... The economies of the [Central American] region are experiencing
slowing rates of growth due to reductions in exports, family
remittances and tourism. Additionally the productive sectors in Central
America have limited access to credit." The region's main disadvantage
considering the current international financial context is that the US
is its most important trading
partner.<br>
<br>
The main aims of the recommended measures are, to increase employment,
to activate mechanisms that provide incentives to agricultural
producers,
to strengthen inter-regional commerce and to encourage investment in
infrastructure. These measures are very similar to programmes proposed
both by the Chinese and United States governments to address the crisis
in their respective countries. The underlying objective is to increase
demand in the economy via productive investment that will minimize the
risk of damaging inflation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Urgent Measures
recommended<br>
<br>
</span>SIECA recommends that the region's Central Banks :
maintain
prudent monetary policies; use available mechanisms to provide liquid
funds to the national financial systems; increase, strengthen and
systematize communication with the general public about the financial
situation, inflationary perspectives and the financial policies being
adopted; look to guarantee the continuity of lines of credit with
regional and international organizations. <br>
<br>
The BCIE, meanwhile, was recommended : to increase the speed at which
the "Program of Support for Inter-Regional Commerce, Financial
Institutions, the Agricultural Sector and Infrastructure" is being
carried out; to design a program of credit for and construction of
social housing for the region; increase the speed at which the program
of Industrial Modernization is carried out; and arrange for the trading
of debt subordinated with multilateral organizations and / or current
partners of the BCIE to take place with the aim of strengthening the
capacity of the bank to fund and support diverse activities within the
region. <br>
<br>
Twelve further general recommendations were made. These
included:&nbsp;
strengthening&nbsp;the process of regional economic integration
(by,
among other things,&nbsp;coordination of productive policies
and&nbsp;consolidation of a regional customs union); support
to&nbsp;productive
sectors, particularly small and medium sized businesses, both
urban and rural, with direct credit, access to training and
technology; stimulating&nbsp;food production and consumption so as
to
ensure food sovereignty in the region; reducing&nbsp;costs of
commercial transactions at regional border points so as to increase
inter-regional trade; giving immediate priority status&nbsp;to
investment in infrastructure to facilitate commercial
activities, especially rural roads;&nbsp;creating&nbsp;a Common
Fund of
Economic and Financial Credit for the development of the
region;&nbsp;promoting&nbsp;activities and programs which
facilitate the
reincorporation of migrants into national economies. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Central America
likely to
align with other emerging integration initiatives<br>
<br>
</span>During the summit the BCIE was urged to look for
additional funds and lines of credit given its failure, as yet, to
provide the US$400 million for each member state requested at the
previous SICA summit in October so as to ensure liquidity in the
region's financial systems. According to Guatemalan President Alvaro
Colom, the BCIE is obliged to look to non-traditional sources of
fundings given that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) have been unable to provide necessary lines of credit. It is
likely the BCIE will look to emerging banks like the ALBA bank, Banco
del Sur and other financial institutions linked to emerging
international powers for alternative sources of funding. <br>
<br>
Certain aspects of both the declaration and the plan of urgent measures
which came out of the SICA summit suggest that the Central American
region is indeed preparing to make moves towards strengthening links
with other emerging regional integration initiatives. The decision to
strengthen commercial and other relations with both the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR),
for example, was stated in the final declaration. <br>
<br>
It is possible that the SICA countries will decide to form monetary and
financial alignments with ALBA along the lines of the the latter's
proposed virtual common currency, the SUCRE, for cross-border trading.
Pedro Páez, the Ecuadorian Minister for Economic Policy,
attended the summit as a special invitee of President Manuel Zelaya so
as to present the Ecuadoran government's proposed Latin American
Currency Agreement. This proposal constitutes an attempt to recuperate
financial and monetary sovereignty in Latin America. The proposal was
first presented at the last ALBA summit in Caracas in November. <br>
<br>
Although the SICA has made no formal announcement about the possibility
of implementing such a move, Páez' presentation was greeted with
great interest by the officials taking part in the San Pedro Sula
summit. In the final declaration the SIECA was instructed to carry out
a study into the implications of a regional common currency. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible role of SUCRE currency innovation</span><br><br>
It is interesting to note that a joint ALBA-PETROCARIBE summit is being
planned for the first trimester of 2009 to discuss an appropriate
regional response to the international financial context. All SICA
countries except El Salvador and Panama are members of PETROCARIBE,
the Caribbean region's energy integration initiative. Costa Rica's
membership should be ratified by the end of this year. It seems more
than likely that during the
joint summit meeting the ALBA country leaders will propose that the
SUCRE be used for trading within PETROCARIBE. <br>
<br>
This may well be as significant a proposal as Russia's proposal to its
Euorpean trading partners that Russian oil and gas be paid for in euros
rather than in dollars. Another example of an important regional effort
to escape the dollar's inflationary kiss of death is the recent
agreement by Argentina and Brazil to trade in their own local
currencies rather than in dollars. The SUCRE may well fulfill a
currency stabilization role for the ALBA countries of Latin America and
the Caribbean.<br>
<br>
With the current instability and volatility of the international
economy it is impossible to predict future economic events and
institutional reactions in Central America, or anywhere else in the
world. With Daniel Ortega at the head of SICA for the next six months,
however, what one can anticipate are decisive moves towards greater
institutional consolidation of Central American unity. Considering
Ortega's and other SICA presidents' express commitment to regional
integration, we are also likely to see SICA maximize existing links
with other regional integration initiatives as part of an attempt to
finally break free from damaging economic and commercial moulds which
have been imposed on the region by European and North American
governments for as long as anyone can remember. <br>
