<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM NICARAGUA'S GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY<br />
AT THE 76TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>76 Ordinary Period of Sessions<br />
General Debate</strong></p>

<p><strong>Monday, September 27th 2021</strong></p>

<p><em>General Assembly Theme: "Building resilience through Hope to recover from COVID, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect people's rights and revitalize the United Nations."</em></p>

<p>Brother Abdulla Shahid, President of the 76 Period of Sessions of the General Assembly</p>

<p>Brother António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations,</p>

<div class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="458"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="252" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8R0w-6uC8j8" width="448"></iframe></div>

<p>Mr. President, Ladies Heads and Heads of Delegation:</p>

<p>1. We continue to live in times of Pandemics that affect Humanity, especially developing countries. These are Times in which the Strength, Faith and Solidarity of the entire Humanity are put to the test, faced with enormous challenges.</p>

<p>2. We convey the solidarity and condolences of Comrade Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of Nicaragua and Comrade Rosario Murillo, Vice-President to all the families around the world who have suffered the severe consequences of COVID-19 and who have lost loved ones.</p>

<p>3. This global health crisis continues to undermine our efforts to overcome existing problems and challenges, such as poverty, hunger and malnutrition, inequality, unemployment, and climate change, caused by the capitalist, irrational and oppressive system of exploitation.</p>

<p>4. The dehumanized hoarding of COVID-19 vaccines by developed countries, which prevents a fair and equitable distribution for all, including developing countries, is unacceptable. It is both necessary and just to guarantee the transfer of technology and financial resources, as well as to declare vaccines a common good of humanity.</p>

<p>5. We must continue, with the Fighting Spirit of Humanity, to face and overcome the pandemic with Solidarity and Cooperation, without conditions and with a robust multilateralism, which will allow us to access vaccines, avoiding inequity and politicization in their distribution.</p>

<p>6. The Pandemic that affects all the countries of our Mother Earth, has evidenced the need to create a new International Economic Model, based on inclusion, equity, social justice, respectful equality among States and Governments, prioritizing the eradication of poverty, ensuring health, as universal rights of humanity; demanding that the resources that are currently destined for war, aggression and destabilization of countries, be instead made available, with a humanistic spirit, for life, peace, security and prosperity for all peoples.</p>

<p>7. We must make common cause with all the challenges, trials and calamities that affect humanity, we must not forget the refugee crisis, and also the pain and suffering of migrants.</p>

<p>8. It is evident that the wars and interventions promoted and carried out by the Western Powers, violate the sovereignty of our peoples, and condemn millions of children, women and vulnerable groups to exile, who suffer the consequences of the greed and ambitions of the most powerful, forcing them to seek refuge in Western countries, that violate their human rights through discriminatory policies, with cruel, inhuman and degrading treatments.</p>

<p>9. Likewise, safe, regular and orderly migration is hampered by the unwillingness of Western countries. Millions of people from developing countries, victims of the unjust neoliberal model, migrate with the illusion of finding better opportunities in developed countries, where they are rejected, in violation of their dignity and human rights.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>10. Recently, on 15th September, we have commemorated the 200 Years of the first Independence of Nicaragua and our Central American Peoples. There have been two centuries of Struggle for Sovereignty, Self-determination and Independence of Nicaragua. Victories for which we continue to fight with conviction, perseverance and dignity.</p>

<p>11. Nicaragua is a Free, Independent, Sovereign State, but imperial forces still persist that threaten our development projects, which undermine our efforts to comply with the 2030 Agenda and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially for the eradication of Poverty, which is the cruelest Pandemic in the world.</p>

<p>12. We urgently require a United Nations that ensures Peace, Justice, Security and Comprehensive Responses for the benefit of Humanity, complying with the commitments that States have with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.</p>

<p>13. Only with a responsible global alliance, in which the powerful respect international law, as well as the Charter of the United Nations, will it be possible to counteract the impacts of other pandemics imposed by some powers to the detriment of peace, international security, independence, sovereignty of the States and the self-determination of all Peoples.<br />
<br />
14. The reinvention of the United Nations is still necessary, as proposed on behalf of Nicaragua by the Nicaraguan Comrade Priest and Foreign Minister, Miguel D'Escoto, during his Presidency of this General Assembly in 2008. We reiterate our support for the African common ground position contained in the Ezulwini consensus and the Sirte declaration, regarding the reform process of the United Nations, including the Security Council.</p>

<p>15. Nicaragua will continue to defend Multilateralism, building relationships based on respect, sovereign equality, solidarity and mutual cooperation, respecting and complying with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, non-interference in internal affairs, and respect for international law.<br />
<br />
16. Due to its peaceful vocation, Nicaragua also advocates a general and complete disarmament, it is in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons for the benefit of humanity.</p>

<p>17. It is unacceptable that in the midst of this Pandemic, weapons of mass destruction continue to be modernized, endangering all of humanity. It is part of the heartless creation of Savage Capitalism, an insatiable attitude of accumulation at the cost of peace, international security and human life.</p>

<p>18. The hope of the inhabitants of the planet, including for the very Peoples of the Countries that manufacture and possess them, is that nuclear weapons, that are a threat to humanity as a whole, will disappear.<br />
<br />
19. Nicaragua is party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, where we promised many years ago, not to allow any country in Latin America and the Caribbean to develop nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>20. We welcome the entry into force of the historic Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which for the first time prohibits the existence, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons, which Nicaragua has ratified.</p>

<p>21. In relation to Afghanistan, we insist that Peace must prevail. The United States and the European countries must act with rationality and responsibility, appealing to them that they should renounce and desist from their Culture and Warlike practices.<br />
<br />
22. The lessons of Afghanistan are clear, neither Intervention nor Unilateral Coercive Sanctions work; they are failed policies, and the Powers have to find the path of peace and respect for international law in order to interact with all the Peoples of the World, especially with developing countries.</p>

<p>23. Nicaragua will continue to promote a culture of peace, of peaceful coexistence among sister countries that make up the United Nations, and we will continue to be a factor of stability, peace and regional security in Central America and the region.</p>

<p>24. The member countries of the UN must continue to make efforts so that Western Powers cease and desist from their warmongering policies and actions, the use or threat of use of force, since they cause more instability and more insecurity at the Global level.</p>

<p>25. We reaffirm the search for a desired Understanding and a peaceful coexistence between Nations; we must continue promoting a Culture of Peace, recognizing the principle of Peaceful Solution of International Controversies by the means offered by international law. That is why we advocate for the validity of the defense of sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and the right to self-determination of our peoples.</p>

<p>26. The illegal Unilateral Coercive Measures must cease immediately, in order to guarantee stability, Peace and the Development of families, peoples and nations.<br />
<br />
27. These Coercive and Aggressive Policies of the Empires constitute a savage obstacle to the eradication of Poverty and to advance towards Sustainable Development. In times of a Pandemic, these measures become a crime against humanity, on the part of those who impose them. For Nicaragua they are unacceptable, we reject them and reiterate our condemnation and our solidarity, with the more than 2 billion people who suffer from these sanctions.</p>

<p>28. Nicaragua joins the peoples of the world in Solidarity to reaffirm our fraternal rejection of the inhuman, illegal, immoral and unjust economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States on the brotherly people and government of Cuba, an extraordinary people, that has fought a titanic battle for more than 60 years, resisting invasions, acts of terrorism, economic sanctions, blockades and all the entanglements of imperialism and its destabilizing actions.</p>

<p>29. We reiterate our militant solidarity with the Sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Bolivarian People, and the Constitutional and Legitimate Government of President Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p>Mr. President, Sisters, Brothers,</p>

<p>30. As our peoples work, resist, respond and recover from the pandemic, we must not forget the challenges posed by the threat of Climate Change and its devastating impact, particularly in developing countries, which will be present even after we have overcome the COVID19 pandemic and our economies have recovered.</p>

<p>31. To preserve and defend the Right to Life of our Mother Earth, concrete results are urgently needed at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow, which are based on the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities, which include greater determination, responsibility and compliance with the commitments regarding Climate Justice and the indispensable Reparation Policy, converted into direct and unconditional cooperation.</p>

<p>32. If we let time pass, without developed countries fulfilling their commitments, the damage to mother earth due to global warming will be irreversible, and they will be historically responsible for this catastrophe.</p>

<p>33. It is of utmost importance that the large emitters, responsible for depredation, degradation and imbalances, recognize our Losses and Damages, contributing to the recovery of our ecosystems.</p>

<p>34. It has been more than proven that Central America and the Caribbean is a region that is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; meteorological events are becoming more frequent and intense, as well as other climatological phenomena. In November of last year, in a period of two weeks, Nicaragua was hit by two destructive category 5 and 4 hurricanes affecting Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities on our Caribbean coast, causing severe damage to infrastructure, production and economy.</p>

<p>35. Nicaragua joined the Paris Agreement in 2017, assuming the commitment to strengthen the interests of the most vulnerable countries and align the relevance of government policies, strategies and instruments, in order to contribute to the goal of limiting global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Large emitters have that historical responsibility.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>36. We wish to express Nicaragua's full solidarity and full support for the cause and yearnings for self-determination, peace and justice of the heroic Palestinian People.</p>

<p>37. Nicaragua will not cease in its call and support for a Two State Solution, the State of Israel and the State of Palestine according to the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its Capital and where both states, on an equal footing, may coexist in full enjoyment of their aspirations of Peace, Security, Cooperation and Harmony.</p>

<p>38. We reiterate our fraternal solidarity with the Government and People of Syria in the defense of their Sovereignty and territorial integrity and in their fight against foreign aggression and International Terrorism. All aggressions against the Syrian People and Government must be ended.</p>

<p>39. We ratify our unwavering commitment to continue supporting the just struggle of the noble Saharawi People, for their self-determination and respect for their dignity and rights as a Sovereign Nation, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.</p>

<p>40. Nicaragua advocates for the full decolonization of our continent, including for the people of Puerto Rico, and the restitution of the Malvinas Islands under the sovereignty of the Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>41. Our people and government support the end of all sanctions against the sister Republic of Iran and support the full implementation of the Joint Plan of Action (JCPOA) of 14th July, 2015. We underline that this agreement demonstrates that dialogue and diplomacy are the most appropriate means for a peaceful solution and are an essential part of the functioning of multilateralism.</p>

<p>42. Faced with this Pandemic, the application of the Principle of Universality is essential for humanitarian reasons, so that Taiwan may participate in the corresponding mechanisms and meetings of the United Nations System</p>

<p>43. We condemn the north american hegemonic political aggressions that threaten the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and the political, economic, commercial and military threats and actions against the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We must defend the principle of dialogue and negotiation, as well as the non-use of force, nor threats, basic Principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>44. We support the Russian Federation in its efforts to promote Peace, understanding and stability throughout the world.</p>

<p>45. In accordance with International Law, the principle of non-Interference in the Internal Affairs of States, must be respected in Belarus. We reject all forms of foreign interventions and external pressures to which it’s Government and People have been subjected.</p>

<p>46. The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity remains firm and committed to the preservation of Peace, Stability and Security in Nicaragua, making its best efforts and developing policies to ensure inclusive prosperity for all Nicaraguans, without distinction.<br />
<br />
47. At the international level, this aspiration is reflected in our efforts to continue building relationships based on respect, equality, solidarity and mutual cooperation, all in accordance with the multilateral and multipolar spirit of the United Nations Charter.</p>

<p>48. The Government of Nicaragua, with the Nicaraguan People leading the way, has developed economic and social policies with women and youth, Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, farmers, the elderly, people with disabilities, as an expression of the Nicaraguan reality and the People President Model of Government.</p>

<p>Mr. President, Sisters, Brothers</p>

<p>49. We reiterate that Nicaragua continues to be an important factor in regional and international stability, peace and security, with positive indicators regarding economic, political and social development, as well as in gender equality, citizen security, and the eradication of poverty. All of which are essential factors to forge Cultures of Peace and Human Development.</p>

<p>50. In our blessed Nicaragua, the motherland of General Sandino and the Poet Rubén Darío, we say to the international community: we respect all peoples, all governments, all countries of the world, we respect international law, the Charter of the UN, the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and we demand equal respect for our Nicaragua, Free, Independent, Sovereign and with Self-determination.</p>

<p>51. With this Constitutional, Sovereign and Patriotic Spirit, on the first Sunday of November of this year, the Nicaraguan People will vote to elect their authorities, with Gender Equity, and with the participation of 15 National and Regional Political Parties, including:</p>

<p>Option 1:<br />
Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC)</p>

<p>Option 2<br />

<p>Option 3<br />

Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance Party (ALN)</p>

<p>Option 10<br />
Alliance for the Republic (APRE)</p>

<p>Option 13<br />

<p>52. It is not the north American empire that decides in Nicaragua, it is the Nicaraguan People, ratifying their commitment to continue working for Peace, Security and Tranquility for all Peoples, Families and Communities, faithful to our Principles and Values; Patriotism, Solidarity, Vocation of Service, Unity and Gender Equity and ready to continue reaping the victories of love for Nicaragua, contributing to international peace and security, on our way to a better, just and humane world.</p>
