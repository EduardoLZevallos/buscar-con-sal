<b>Rio de Janeiro Declaration </b> <b> </b> <b>Strengthening Global South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and </b> <b>Sustainable Governance </b></div>

<p><br />
<b>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil<br />
6 July 2025 </b></p>

<p>1. We, the Leaders of BRICS countries, met in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 6 to 7 July 2025 for the XVII BRICS Summit held under the theme: “Strengthening Global South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance”.</p>

<p>2. We reaffirm our commitment to the BRICS spirit of mutual respect and understanding, sovereign equality, solidarity, democracy, openness, inclusiveness, collaboration and consensus. As we build upon 17 years of BRICS Summits, we further commit ourselves to strengthening cooperation in the expanded BRICS under the three pillars of political and security, economic and financial, cultural and people-to-people cooperation, and to enhancing our strategic partnership for the benefit of our people through the promotion of peace, a more representative, fairer international order, a reinvigorated and reformed multilateral system, sustainable development and inclusive growth.</p>

<p>3. We welcome the Republic of Indonesia as a BRICS member, as well as the Republic of Belarus, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Cuba, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Malaysia, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Republic of Uganda, and the Republic of Uzbekistan as BRICS partner countries.</p>

<p>4. We underline the significance of the adoption of the BRICS Leaders’ Framework Declaration on Climate Finance and of the BRICS Leaders’ Statement on the Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence, as well as endorse the launch of the BRICS Partnership for the Elimination of Socially Determined Diseases. These initiatives reflect our joint efforts to foster inclusive and sustainable solutions to pressing global issues.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Strengthening Multilateralism and Reforming Global Governance </b></p>

<p>5. We reiterate our commitment to reforming and improving global governance by promoting a more just, equitable, agile, effective, efficient, responsive, representative, legitimate, democratic and accountable international and multilateral system in the spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. In this regard, we take note of the adoption of the Pact of the Future at the Summit of the Future, including its two annexes, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration of Future Generations. Bearing in mind the need to adapt the current architecture of international relations to better reflect the contemporary realities, we reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and upholding the international law, including the Purposes and Principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations (UN), in their entirety and interconnectedness as its indispensable cornerstone, and the central role of the UN in the international system, in which sovereign states cooperate to maintain international peace and security, advance sustainable development, ensure the promotion and protection of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all as well as cooperation based on solidarity, mutual respect, justice and equality. We also reiterate our commitment to ensuring greater and more meaningful participation and representation of Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDCs), as well as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), especially from Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, in global decision-making processes and structures and making them better attuned to contemporary realities. We also call for achieving equitable geographical representation in the Secretariat of the United Nations and other international organizations in a timely manner, as well as increasing the role and share of women, especially from EMDCs, at all levels of leadership and responsibilities in these organizations. We stress the need for the selection and appointment process of UN executive heads and senior positions to be guided by the principles of transparency and inclusiveness, and carried out in accordance with all the provisions of Article 101 of the UN Charter, with due regard for recruiting staff on a geographical basis as wide as possible and the increased participation of women, and adhere to the general rule that there should be no monopoly on senior posts in the UN system by nationals of any State or group of States.</p>

<p>6. Recognizing the 2023 Johannesburg-II Leaders’ Declaration, we reiterate our support for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more democratic, representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of developing countries in the Council’s memberships so that it can adequately respond to prevailing global challenges and support the legitimate aspirations of emerging and developing countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including BRICS countries, to play a greater role in international affairs, in particular in the United Nations, including its Security Council. We recognize the legitimate aspirations of African countries, as reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. We stress that the United Nations Security Council reform is to lead to the amplified voice of the Global South. Recalling the 2022 Beijing and 2023 Johannesburg-II Leaders’ Declarations, China and Russia, as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, reiterate their support to the aspirations of Brazil and India to play a greater role in the United Nations, including its Security Council.</p>

<p>7. In light of the 80th Anniversary of the United Nations, we recall UNGA Resolutions 75/1, 77/335 and other relevant resolutions, and reiterate our commitment to provide the United Nations with all the required support it needs to discharge its mandate. We emphasize the strong call for reforms of the principal organs of the United Nations with a view to achieving concrete progress. We recommit to instill new life in the discussions on reform of the UN Security Council and continue the work to revitalize the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council. We look forward to the successful conclusion of the 2025 Review of the Peacebuilding architecture.</p>

<p>8. We agree that, in the context of the contemporary realities of the multipolar world, it is crucial that developing countries strengthen their efforts to promote dialogue and consultations for more just and equitable global governance and mutually beneficial relations among nations. We acknowledge that multipolarity can expand opportunities for EMDCs to develop their constructive potential and enjoy universally beneficial, inclusive and equitable economic globalization and cooperation. We highlight the importance of the Global South as a driver for positive change, especially in the face of significant international challenges, including deepening geopolitical tensions, rapid economic downturns and technological changes, protectionist measures and migratory challenges. We believe BRICS countries continue to play a pivotal role in voicing the concerns and priorities of the Global South, as well as in promoting a more just, sustainable, inclusive, representative and stable international order based on international law.</p>

<p>9<b>.</b> Recalling that 2025 marks the eightieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a war which brought untold sorrow to humankind, particularly in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Pacific and other parts of the world, we render our full support to the UNGA Resolution 79/272 on the Eightieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, on this historic event, which established the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.</p>

<p>10. On the 80th anniversary, we reiterate the urgent need to reform the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWI) to make them more agile, effective, credible, inclusive, fit for purpose, unbiased, accountable, and representative, enhancing their legitimacy. First and foremost, they must reform their governance structure to reflect the transformation of the global economy since their establishment. The voice and representation of EMDEs in the BWI must reflect their increasing weight in the global economy. Moreover, we call for improved management procedures, including through a merit-based and inclusive selection process that would increase regional diversity and representation of EMDEs in the leadership of the IMF and the WBG, as well as the role and share of women at the managerial level.</p>

<p>11. In the current context of uncertainty and volatility, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must remain adequately resourced and agile, at the center of the global financial safety net (GFSN), to effectively support its members, particularly the most vulnerable countries. Despite the absence of quota realignment, we have provided consent to the proposed quota increase under the 16th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) and urge IMF members that have not yet done so to provide their consent and give effect to the quota increases under the 16th GRQ with no further delay. We urge the IMF Executive Board to fulfil the mandate set by the Board of Governors to develop approaches to quota share realignment, including through a new quota formula, under the 17th GRQ at the earliest possible time. We support the efforts of the IMF Executive Board and International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) Deputies in developing general principles to guide future discussions and help foster convergence of views around the pressing quota and governance reforms. We reiterate that further quota realignment in the IMF should not come at the expense of developing countries, reflecting countries’ relative positions in the global economy, and increasing the shares of EMDEs. In line with the BRICS Rio de Janeiro Vision for IMF Quota and Governance Reform, we stand ready to engage constructively with other IMF members to guarantee that meaningful quota share realignment and governance reforms are included in the 17th GRQ. <b> </b></p>

<p>12.<b> </b>We reaffirm that the 2025 World Bank Shareholding Review, co-chaired by Brazil, is a critical tool to strengthen multilateralism and enhance the legitimacy of the World Bank Group, as a better, bigger, and more effective development finance institution. In line with the Lima principles, we continue to advocate for the increased voice and representation of developing countries, underpinned by a shareholding realignment that corrects their historic underrepresentation. We will endeavor to ensure that tackling poverty and inequality, including through job creation, in the challenging context of climate change and digitalization, remains central to the World Bank Group’s mission.</p>

<p>13. The multilateral trading system has long been at a crossroads. The proliferation of trade-restrictive actions, whether in the form of indiscriminate rising of tariffs and non- tariff measures, or protectionism under the guise of environmental objectives, threatens to further reduce global trade, disrupt global supply chains, and introduce uncertainty into international economic and trade activities, potentially exacerbating existing economic disparities and affecting prospects for global economic development. We voice serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules. In this context, we reiterate our support for the rules- based, open, transparent, fair, inclusive, equitable, non-discriminatory, consensus-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core, with special and differential treatment (S&amp;DT) for its developing members. We emphasize that the WTO, at its 30th anniversary, remains the only multilateral institution with the necessary mandate, expertise, universal reach and capacity to lead on the multiple dimensions of international trade discussions, including the negotiation of new trade rules. We recall the commitment made at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference and reaffirmed at the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference to work towards a necessary reform of the Organization to ensure its relevance and restore the credibility of the multilateral trading system. We remain committed to the urgent restoration of an accessible, effective, fully-functioning, two-tier binding WTO dispute settlement system. We strongly support Ethiopia and Iran’s bid for accession to the WTO. We welcome the BRICS Declaration on WTO Reform and Strengthening of the Multilateral Trading System adopted by the Ministers of Trade.</p>

<p>14. We condemn the imposition of unilateral coercive measures that are contrary to international law, and reiterate that such measures, inter alia in the form of unilateral economic sanctions and secondary sanctions, have far-reaching negative implications for the human rights, including the rights to development, health and food security, of the general population of targeted states, disproportionally affecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations, deepening the digital divide and exacerbating environmental challenges. We call for the elimination of such unlawful measures, which undermine international law and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. We reaffirm that BRICS member states do not impose or support non-UN Security Council authorized sanctions that are contrary to international law<b>.</b></p>

<p>15. Recognizing the interconnected nature of global health challenges and their transboundary implications, we reaffirm our commitment to strengthening global health governance by enhancing international cooperation and solidarity. We underscore the role of the World Health Organization as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work within the UN System, particularly in times of crises and emergencies, and emphasize the necessity of bolstering its mandate, capabilities, and financing mechanisms. A robust and adequately funded WHO is essential to effectively address current and future public health challenges, mitigate inequalities, and ensure equitable access to healthcare services, including medicines, and vaccines for all, particularly in developing countries. We commit to actively supporting efforts to strengthen the global health architecture, fostering equality, inclusivity, transparency, and responsiveness, ensuring no country is left behind in achieving health-related Sustainable Development Goals. We acknowledge the adoption of the WHO Pandemic Agreement by the 78th World Health Assembly. The Agreement will solidify the foundation for a safer and more equitable world against future pandemics. We stand ready to carry this momentum forward to ensure a timely conclusion of Member States-led and -driven negotiations for the Agreement’s Annex on Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing.</p>

<p>16. We recognize that Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a milestone opportunity to boost development towards a more prosperous future. To achieve that goal, we underscore that global governance of AI should mitigate potential risks and address the needs of all countries, including those of the Global South. A collective global effort is needed to establish an AI governance that upholds our shared values, addresses risks, builds trust, and ensures broad and inclusive international collaboration and access, in accordance with sovereign laws, including capacity building for developing countries, with the United Nations at its core. To support a constructive debate towards a more balanced approach, we agreed on the BRICS Leaders’ Statement on the Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to foster responsible development, deployment, and use of AI technologies for sustainable development and inclusive growth, in compliance with national regulatory frameworks, the UN Charter and respecting the sovereignty of States. <b> </b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Promoting Peace, Security and International Stability </b></p>

<p>17. We express concern about ongoing conflicts in many parts of the world and the current state of polarization and fragmentation in the international order. We express alarm at the current trend that has seen a critical increase in global military spending, to the detriment of the provision of adequate financing for development to developing countries. We advocate for a multilateral approach that respects diverse national viewpoints and positions on crucial global issues, including sustainable development, the eradication of hunger and poverty and contributing to the global response to climate change, while expressing deep concern over attempts to link security with the climate change agenda.</p>

<p>18. We note the current global context of polarization and distrust and encourage global action to strengthen international peace and security. We call on the international community to respond to these challenges and associated security threats through politico-diplomatic measures to lower conflict potential and stress the need to engage in conflict prevention efforts, including through addressing their root causes. We underscore that security among all countries is indivisible and reiterate our commitment to the peaceful resolution of international disputes through dialogue, consultation and diplomacy. We encourage the active role of regional organizations in conflict prevention and resolution and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises. We highlight the importance of mediation and preventive diplomacy as essential tools to avoid crises and prevent their escalation, in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter. In this regard, we agree to explore avenues for cooperation on the prevention of armed conflicts, UN peacekeeping missions, African Union peace support operations, and mediation and peace processes.</p>

<p>19. We reaffirm our strong commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation to address humanitarian crises worldwide and express concern at the dwindling of international responses, which were already insufficient, fragmented and often politicized. We strongly condemn all violations of international humanitarian law, including deliberate attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including civilian infrastructure, as well as the denial or obstruction of humanitarian access and the targeting of humanitarian personnel. We underline the need to address accountability for all violations of international humanitarian law. Such breaches of international law not only intensify immediate suffering but also undermine prospects for lasting peace by destroying the material and social foundations necessary for post-conflict reconstruction. We recognize international efforts undertaken by BRICS members to promote respect for, adherence to, and effective implementation of International Humanitarian Law. <b> </b></p>

<p>20. We reiterate our commitment to the full implementation and advancement of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, especially in light of the 25th anniversary of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000). We further reiterate the importance of ensuring the full, equal, safe, and meaningful participation of women in decision-making at all levels of peace and security processes, including conflict prevention and resolution, humanitarian relief, mediation, peace operations, peacebuilding, and post-conflict reconstruction and development.</p>

<p>21. We condemn the military strikes against the Islamic Republic of Iran since 13 June 2025, which constitute a violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and express grave concern over the subsequent escalation of the security situation in the Middle East. We further express serious concern over deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure and peaceful nuclear facilities under full safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in violation of international law and relevant resolutions of the IAEA. Nuclear safeguards, safety, and security must always be upheld, including in armed conflicts, to protect people and the environment from harm. In this context, we reiterate our support for diplomatic initiatives aimed at addressing regional challenges. We call upon the United Nations Security Council to be seized of this matter.</p>

<p>22. We recall our national positions concerning the conflict in Ukraine as expressed in the appropriate fora, including the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. We note with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation and good offices, including the creation of the African Peace Initiative and the Group of Friends for Peace, aimed at peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. We expect that current efforts will lead to a sustainable peace settlement.</p>

<p>23. We are deeply concerned over continued conflicts and instability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In this regard, we endorse the Joint Statement by BRICS Deputy Foreign Ministers and Special Envoys at their meeting of 28 March 2025<b>. </b></p>

<p>24.<b> </b>We reiterate our grave concern about the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, with the resumption of continuous Israeli attacks against Gaza and obstruction of the entry of humanitarian aid into the territory. We call for adherence to international law, in particular to international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and condemn all violations of IHL, including the use of starvation as a method of warfare. We also condemn attempts to politicize or militarize humanitarian assistance. We exhort the parties to engage in good faith in further negotiations to achieve an immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and all other parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the release of all hostages and detainees held in violation of international law, and sustained and unhindered access and delivery of humanitarian aid. We reassert our steadfast support for UNRWA and stress the need to fully respect the mandate, bestowed on it by the UNGA, for the provision of basic services to Palestine refugees in its five fields of operations. We call on all relevant parties to respect their obligations under international law and act with utmost restraint and to avoid escalatory actions and provocative declarations. We note, in this regard, the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice in the legal proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel, which, inter alia, reaffirmed Israel’s legal obligation to ensure the provision of humanitarian aid in Gaza.</p>

<p>25. We recall that the Gaza Strip is an inseparable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. We underline, in this regard, the importance of unifying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under the Palestinian Authority, and reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the right to their independent State of Palestine.</p>

<p>26. We call on the international community to support the Palestinian Authority in undergoing reforms to fulfill the Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations for independence and statehood, as well as the expeditious reconstruction of the civil infrastructure of the territory, with a central role by the Palestinians, as agreed in the Emergency Arab Summit on Palestine of 4 March 2025, and we note with appreciation the initiative to convene an upcoming pledging conference to be held in Cairo. We underscore that efforts to stabilize and rebuild Gaza must go hand in hand with a just and lasting political resolution of the protracted conflict. We express our firm opposition to the forced displacement, temporary or permanent, under any pretext, of any of the Palestinian population from the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as well as any geographic or demographic changes to the territory of the Gaza Strip. We reiterate that international law and international judicial bodies demand the end of the illegal occupation and the immediate cessation of all practices that undermine legal norms and obstruct a just and lasting peace.</p>

<p>27. We reaffirm that a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved by peaceful means and depends on the fulfillment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the rights to self-determination and return. We reaffirm our support for the State of Palestine’s full membership in the United Nations in the context of the unwavering commitment to the two-state solution, in accordance with international law, including relevant UN Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, and the Arab Peace Initiative, that includes the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within the internationally recognized 1967 borders, which includes the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in order to achieve the vision of two States living side by side, in peace and security. We affirm the need for adequate representation of Palestine in all relevant international organizations, including multilateral financial institutions, and access to their resources. We welcome the continued efforts by BRICS members towards an urgent ceasefire, to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid and to achieve a lasting and sustainable peace in the region.</p>

<p>28. We welcome the ceasefire in Lebanon and call on all parties to strictly adhere to its terms and to fully implement UNSC Resolution 1701. We condemn the continued violations of the ceasefire and of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon. We call on Israel to respect the terms agreed with the Lebanese government and to withdraw its occupying forces from all of the Lebanese territory, including the five sites in Southern Lebanon in which they remain.</p>

<p>29. We reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Syria and call for a peaceful and inclusive Syrian-led and Syrian-owned, UN- facilitated political process, based on the principles of Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015), in a manner that ensures the security and well-being of the civilian population, without discrimination. We condemn the violence perpetrated in various Syria’s provinces among the country’s communities, the continuation of terrorist activities by ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaeda affiliates in Syria, including the recent bombing at Mar Elias Church and Rif Dimashq, and express sincere condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims of these terrorist attacks. We also condemn the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters’ presence in Syrian territory as well as the risk of spreading of terrorists from Syria to regional countries. Syria should firmly oppose all forms of terrorism and extremism and take concrete actions to respond to concerns of the international community about terrorism. We welcome the lifting of unilateral sanctions on Syria and hope that this will support efforts to revive the Syrian economy and launch the reconstruction phase in a way that fosters development and stability. While condemning strongly the occupation of parts of Syria, in blatant violation of international law and the 1974 disengagement, we urge Israel to withdraw its forces from the Syrian territory without delay.</p>

<p>30. We reiterate that the principle “African solutions to African problems” should continue to serve as the basis for conflict resolution on the African continent. We recognize the critical role played by the African Union in conflict prevention, management and resolution and reaffirm our support for African peace efforts on the continent, including those undertaken by the African Union, and African sub-regional organizations.

We commend efforts and achievements by African countries and organizations in their pursuit of lasting peace and sustainable development, while expressing serious concern over the severe humanitarian crises resulting from new and protracted armed conflicts in some regions of Africa, particularly the devastating effects of conflicts in Sudan, the Great Lakes region, and the Horn of Africa. We reaffirm our support for efforts aimed at finding political solutions to these crises, reiterate the call for an end to hostilities, and emphasize the need for the peaceful resolution of conflicts.</p>

<p>32. We are deeply concerned over the situation in Sudan resulted in a humanitarian crisis and the growing risk of proliferation of extremism and terrorism.

<p>33. We remain seriously concerned with the ongoing deterioration of the security, humanitarian, and economic situation in Haiti. We reaffirm that security and development go hand in hand. The current crisis requires a Haitian-led solution that encompasses national dialogue and consensus building among local political forces, institutions and the society and we call on the international community to support the Haitian endeavors to dismantle the gangs, enhance the security situation and put in place the foundations for long-lasting social and economic development in the country. We support the role of the United Nations and highlight the need for international cooperation to address Haiti’s multifaceted crises effectively.<b> </b></p>

<p>34. We express strong condemnation of any acts of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, whenever, wherever and by whomsoever committed. We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025, during which 26 people were killed and many more injured. We reaffirm our commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens. We reiterate that terrorism should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group and that all those involved in terrorist activities and their support must be held accountable and brought to justice in accordance with relevant national and international law. We urge to ensure zero tolerance for terrorism and reject double standards in countering terrorism.

<p>38. We express concern about the growing risks of nuclear danger and conflict. We reiterate the need for invigorating the system of disarmament, arms control and non- proliferation and for preserving its integrity and effectiveness to achieve global stability and international peace and security. We stress the significant contribution of nuclear- weapon-free zones to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, reaffirm our support for and respect towards all existing nuclear-weapons free-zones and their associated assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, and acknowledge the paramount importance of the efforts aiming at accelerating the implementation of the resolutions on the Establishment of a Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East, including the Conference convened pursuant to UN General Assembly Decision 73/546.

We recognize the submission of the updated Draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT) to the Conference on Disarmament in 2014 as an important step towards this goal. We stress that practical and non-binding commitments such as Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs), and universally agreed norms, rules, and principles may also contribute to PAROS. We note the initiative of some BRICS Members at the General Assembly to create a single Open-Ended Working Group to enable coherent, inclusive and effective discussions that serves such purpose and undertake to engage constructively in the process, on the basis of existing achievements, including on substantial elements on a legally binding instrument on PAROS.</p>

<p>40. While emphasizing the potential of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to bridge the growing digital divides within and between countries, we acknowledge challenges and threats stemming from and within the digital realm. We reaffirm our commitment to the promotion of an open, secure, stable, accessible, peaceful, and interoperable ICT environment. We underscore the leading role of the United Nations in fostering constructive dialogue to forge common understandings on security in the use of ICTs and discussions on developing a universal legal framework in this realm and the further development and implementation of universally agreed norms, rules and principles for responsible behavior of States in the use of ICTs. We call for a comprehensive, balanced, objective approach to the development and security of ICT products and systems as well as for the development and implementation of globally interoperable common rules and standards for supply chain security.

We also acknowledge the progress made through the BRICS Working Group on Security in the Use of ICTs in areas such as policy exchanges, cooperation between Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), law enforcement cooperation and joint research and development. In this regard, we welcome the negotiation of the BRICS memoranda of understanding on law enforcement cooperation and on multilateral cooperation among CERTs. We underscore the importance of strengthening academic cooperation and sharing information on opportunities for exchange programs, in line with the Roadmap of Practical Cooperation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs and its progress report.</p>

<p>41. We commend the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime, a landmark multilateral achievement which will constitute an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in preventing and combating cybercrime and in ensuring the timely and lawful collection and sharing of evidence in electronic form of any serious crimes that may be committed through the use of ICT systems. We highlight the important contribution of BRICS countries to its adoption since it was first proposed. We call upon all States to sign it at the earliest opportunity, in Hanoi in 2025, and ratify it, in accordance with domestic laws, processes and procedures, as soon as possible in order to ensure its rapid entry into force, as well as to continue their engagement in the ad Hoc Committee, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 74/247 and 75/282, with a view to negotiating a draft protocol supplementary to the Convention, addressing, inter alia, additional criminal offences as appropriate.</p>

We reiterate the importance of ensuring that trade and sustainable development policies are mutually supportive, and aligned with WTO rules.</p>

<p>44. We welcome the discussions of the BRICS Task Force on PPPs and Infrastructure regarding the mitigation of exchange rate risk and the preparation of projects for climate- resilient infrastructure, aiming to improve project readiness and increase private investment. Additionally, we welcome ongoing discussions on an information hub for infrastructure projects that can foster collaboration and enhance information sharing, and we encourage the Task Force to further explore this initiative.</p>

<p>45. As the New Development Bank is set to embark on its second golden decade of high- quality development, we recognize and support its growing role as a robust and strategic agent of development and modernization in the Global South. We welcome the Bank’s steady expansion of its capacity to mobilize resources, foster innovation, expand local currency financing, diversify funding sources, and support impactful projects that advance sustainable development, reduce inequality, and promote infrastructure investments and economic integration. We also acknowledge and encourage the ongoing expansion of its membership and the strengthening of its governance framework, which enhance the Bank’s institutional resilience and operational effectiveness, to continue executing its purpose and functions in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.

<p>53.<b> </b>We welcome the progress on the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), including the consensus reached by the Technical Team on the proposal for the revised Treaty and regulations. We support efforts to enhance the CRA’s flexibility and effectiveness, notably through the inclusion of eligible payment currencies and improved risk management. We also value the participation of new BRICS members who have expressed interest in joining the CRA and we are committed to onboarding them on a voluntary basis and according to country-specific circumstances.</p>

<p>54. We commit to ensuring supply chain resilience, with particular attention to the needs of developing countries, guided by the principles of efficiency, transparency, modernization, inclusivity, and sustainability, in line with our respective national sustainable development strategies. We recall the relevance of further promoting the active engagement of the private sector, supporting the development and promotion of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and fostering a more resilient and dynamic global trade ecosystem. We intend to further exchange best practices of supporting MSMEs, including through digital services and platforms aimed at simplifying business operations.</p>

<p>59.<b> </b>We encourage BRICS members to explore the possibility for joint action in the field of digital infrastructure to ensure the integrity, stability of the functioning and security of national segments of Internet while avoiding Internet fragmentation and respecting national legislative frameworks regarding any aspects of Internet use, including security ones. <b> </b></p>

<p>60. We appreciate the efforts by the Brazilian Chairship in organizing the Webinar on Digital Transformation and Meaningful Connectivity, and encourage continued knowledge sharing and policy exchange to facilitate the adoption of ICTs to ensure inclusive, accessible and scalable digital services, across different sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, health, education and financing, tailored to different needs of each country. We appreciate the efforts made by India for organizing the Capacity Building Sessions on Digital Transformation in BRICS as a side-event and encourage BRICS members to continue promoting side events.</p>

<p>61. We acknowledge the holding of the BRICS Forum on Future Networks Innovation in 2025, hosted by China and Brazil. We welcome the adoption of the Terms of Reference of the Study Groups on AI, Next Generation Communications, Internet Application in Industry 4.0 and EMF Exposure by the Council of the BRICS Institute of Future Networks as well as the nomination of their chairs and vice-chairs.

<p>62. We reaffirm our commitment to make joint efforts to achieve the rational, efficient, equitable, fair, effective and economical use of spectrum and associated satellite orbits, we encourage further cooperation among BRICS members to facilitate cooperation on space sustainability. We note with satisfaction that the Brazilian chairship will produce a report with proposals on future BRICS work on Sustainable Space Connectivity Resources for consideration and future actions. We affirm that the technical reach of space telecommunications systems should not bypass state sovereignty in any case, and the provision of satellite services within the territory of a state should be carried out only if authorized by that state. We welcome the development of the BRICS White Paper on Sustainable Space Connectivity Resources. <b> </b></p>

<p>63.<b> </b>We recognize the importance of international cooperation for the peaceful exploration and uses of outer space and reiterate our commitment to reducing existing asymmetries in space capabilities among BRICS countries. We recognize that strengthening the exchange of data, expertise and best practices in space activities constitutes an important element in advancing ongoing cooperation between our space agencies and fostering sustainable progress.

<p>65. We note that high debt levels in some countries reduce the fiscal space needed to address ongoing development challenges aggravated by spillover effects from external shocks, particularly from fluctuations in financial and monetary policies in some advanced economies as well as the inherent problems with the international financial architecture. High interest rates and tighter financing conditions worsen debt vulnerabilities in many countries. We believe it is necessary to address the international debt properly and in a holistic manner to support economic recovery and sustainable development, taking into account each nation’s laws and internal procedures, accompanied by sustainable external debt and fiscal prudence. We recognise the need to address in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner the debt vulnerabilities of both low and middle income countries. One of the instruments, amongst others, to collectively address debt vulnerabilities is through predictable, orderly, timely and coordinated implementation of the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment with the participation of official bilateral creditors, private creditors and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in line with the principle of joint action and fair burden- sharing. We remain engaged in enhancing coordination between debtors and official bilateral, multilateral and private creditors to help Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) address debt issues in a fair and constructive way from a development perspective. <b> </b></p>

<p>66. Recognizing the central role of data to modern life as a catalyst for innovation-driven development and the formulation of informed and inclusive public policies, we reaffirm the need for a common and principle-based interoperable framework on data governance,including respect for national data sovereignty, efficient, convenient, safe and mutually agreed cross-border data flows and ethical use of data, to address the principles of collection, recording, storage, organization, procectivelyssing and transfer of data; protect personal information rights and interests, including individual privacy; promote the interoperability of national data policy regulations; and distribute the monetary and non- monetary benefits of data among developing countries and their citizens. In this regard, we welcome the conclusion of the “BRICS Data Economy Governance Understanding” as a roadmap to leverage the data economy across BRICS in order to promote safe access to technology, safeguard individual and national interests, promote the digitalization of industry and services, expansion of intra-BRICS trade.</p>

<p>67. We emphasize that e-commerce has become an important driver of global economic growth, fostering international trade in goods and services, ensuring foreign investment flows and facilitating innovation. We are resolved to further increase trust in e-commerce and ensure full-fledged protection of the rights of e-commerce parties, by intensifying cooperation in the realms of utilizing digital technologies for consumer rights protection, exploring online dispute resolution tools and creating enabling environment for businesses to enter global markets, exchanging views on the issue of small value product trade through the cross-border e-commerce.</p>

<p>68. We continue to recognise the effectiveness of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) of the BRICS countries as a well-established mechanism for trade and industrial cooperation and the facilitation of manufacturing, including those but not limited to high-tech sectors of the economy, IT and IT enabled services, tourism, port and transport infrastructure, development and commercialization of technologies as well as for the production of new types of value-added products. We also acknowledge that Special Economic Zones provide immense opportunities for encouraging additional investment in priority areas of economic development and recognize the potential of SEZs as a tool to stimulate economic growth and create new job opportunities, specially, but not limited to, in high tech and infrastructure sectors.</p>

<p>69. We recognize that BRICS countries are key players in world food production and, as such, have a critical role in enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability, and ensuring global food security and nutrition. We also recognize that family farmers, including smallholders, pastoralists, artisanal and small-scale fishers and aquaculture producers, indigenous peoples and local communities, women and youth, are essential stakeholders of agriculture and food systems. We welcome ongoing efforts to promote sustainability, inclusivity, and equitable market access in the global sustainable vegetable oils sector. We call for continued collaboration among BRICS countries and partners to support smallholder farmers, ensure fair pricing, and foster resilient and sustainable agricultural value chains. We recognize that mechanization and technological innovation in small-scale agriculture, including information and digital innovations, are strategic opportunities for reducing the drudgery of work, increasing productivity and income, enhancing resilience, and accelerating the sustainable transition.</p>

<p>70. We emphasize the importance of ensuring food security and nutrition and mitigating the impacts of acute food price volatility, as well as abrupt supply crises, including fertilizers shortage. In this regard, we acknowledge the importance of continued elaboration of the initiative to establish a grain trading platform within BRICS (the BRICS Grain Exchange) and its subsequent development, and expanding into other agricultural products and commodities. We support further discussions on national policies and on international coordination that enhance food availability, accessibility, utilization, stability and affordability, as well as relevant agricultural and food production inputs in BRICS and other developing countries – including those that strengthen national capacities to respond to supply disruptions, such as national food reserve systems. Under exceptional circumstances of supply shortages or acute food price spikes affecting a BRICS member, we recognize that cooperation initiatives can facilitate emergency responses and natural disaster management, guided by national priorities and consistent with the World Trade Organization rules. None of these measures should lead to unfair trade practices or violations of international trade norms, as their sole purpose is to support food security and nutrition, including through international solidarity. We recognize the importance of reducing food loss and waste, and ensuring animal and plant health through joint prevention and control of dangerous diseases and pests, including by increasing transparency in the movement of food and feed, with an unified electronic certification system for animal and plant products as an important tool.</p>

<p>71. We call for further cooperation in agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture in order to end hunger and eliminate all forms of malnutrition and eradicate poverty, promote sustainable agriculture and rural development, through implement technologies and innovation, and ensure food security, incentivize investments in the local production of machinery and equipment that is tailored to the specific needs and affordable for small- scale and family farmers as well as fisheries and aquaculture workers. Building on the Deccan High-Level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition, we also recognize the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty as an important initiative to promote international cooperation. We also look forward to advance discussions on facilitating intra-BRICS trade of agricultural products, agricultural and food production inputs, and improve value chains and sustainable agricultural practices. We reaffirm the need to develop a fair agricultural trading system and implement resilient and sustainable agriculture. We commit to minimize disruptions and promote rules-based trade in agriculture and fertilizers with the view to ensure a continuous flow of food and essential inputs for agricultural production which should be exempted from undue restrictive economic measures, inconsistent with WTO rules, including those affecting producers and exporters of agricultural products as well as business services with regard to international shipments. We welcome the launch of the BRICS Partnership for Land Restoration, in line with the framework of the UNCCD, and the first BRICS AWG Report on the Contributions to Implementing the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty.</p>

<p>72. We reaffirm our commitment to further advance and develop cooperation in the field of competition law and policy among BRICS countries with a view to contribute to sustainable development of markets, effective combatting anticompetitive crossborder practices, promoting healthy market environment. We acknowledge the role of the BRICS International Competition Law and Policy Center activities in knowledge creation and knowledge sharing amongst BRICS competition authorities and the importance to ensure the most favorable conditions for the competition law development of BRICS economies and work towards the elimination of monopoly barriers in socially important markets. We welcome holding of the IX BRICS International Competition Conference in 2025 in South Africa.</p>

<p>73. We welcome the adoption of the Brasilia Declaration of the Meeting of Heads of BRICS National standardization bodies, which acknowledges the significant benefits of cooperation in this field, including the facilitation of economic relations and trade, the advancement of consumer safety, and the promotion of sustainable development. We encourage the timely conclusion of the negotiations of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the Field of Standardization, as the next milestone towards fostering standardization and metrology as effective tools to help eliminate barriers to trade and facilitate the cross-border movement of goods and services.</p>

<p>74. We commend the continuous exchange of best practices between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the BRICS countries. Taking into account the role of SAIs in promoting good governance and effectiveness of public policies, we recognize the importance of SAIs’ taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital technologies, including the AI, in their work, while minimizing the risks created by these technologies.</p>

<p>75. Recognizing the importance of official statistics for effective decision-making, we express our support to enhance the statistical cooperation within BRICS, including the annual release of the BRICS Joint Statistical Publication and the BRICS Joint Statistical Publication Snapshot, as well as exchange of best practices in the areas of official statistics in the BRICS countries.</p>

<p>76. We will continue to cooperate to promote a fair, more inclusive, stable, and efficient international tax system fit for the 21st century. We restate our commitment to tax transparency and to fostering global dialogue on effective and fair taxation, enhancing progressivity and contributing to the efforts to reduce inequality. We aim to deepen global coordination between tax authorities, improve domestic revenue mobilization, provide fair allocation of taxing rights and combat tax evasion and tax-related illicit financial flows. In this regard, we welcome the BRICS Joint Statement in support of the United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation and will continue to engage constructively in the negotiations of the UN Convention and its protocols. We welcome the progress in customs cooperation, notably the initiatives for implementing the Joint Action Plan towards Mutual Recognition of the Authorized Economic Operator programs, subject to such exceptions, modifications or adaptations as agreed on bilaterally. A key development in customs cooperation is the establishment of BRICS Customs Centers of Excellence and the development of Smart Customs, which we will continue to encourage.</p>

<p>77. We highlight the fruitful cooperation carried out under IP BRICS by Intellectual Property (IP) Offices. We support achieving more practical outcomes under 8 cooperation streams such as promotion of IP awareness and examiners’ training guided by the <i>Operational Guideline Framework</i>, seeking a strong contribution for IP to economic and social development.
