Petrocaribe is providing hope
during the devastating food crisis</b></p>

On August
11 and 12 the Executive Technical Committee of the Council of
Agricultural Ministers of Petrocaribe met for the first time in La
Habana, Cuba, to discuss progress on the regional energy initiative's
proposed Food Security Treaty. To put
the&nbsp;<a href="FAO_summit.html">Nicaraguan
government's successful food policy</a> into its regional context,
Tortilla con Sal reports on how the powers behind Petrocaribe are
providing the region with an alternative to the dismal perspective of
continued implementation of the type of food policy prescribed by
imperialist powers.</span><br>
<br>
Petrocaribe is a regional energy
integration initiative by which Venezuela supplies country members
with up to 100% of their fuel consumption under very preferential
payment conditions. The initiative was founded by Venezuela and Cuba
in 2005. Today the multilateral initiative has 19 member countries:
Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Belize, Cuba, Dominica, Granada,
Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua,&nbsp; Dominican Republic, Nevis and St.Kitts, Santa
Lucía, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Surinam and Venezuela.
Costa Rica applied to join and is expected to sign the agreement in September. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The
idea that Petrocaribe should include a Food Security Treaty arose
during the&nbsp;V Petrocaribe Governmental Summit in Maracaibo,
Venezuela, last month (July 12 and 13). During this meeting a number
of member country representatives voiced the opinion that immediate
action was necessary to contain the devastating impact of the global
food crisis on the region. <br>
<br>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
responded by proposing the creation of a "petro-food" fund with US$0.50
of every barrel of oil exported by Venezuela outside cooperation
agreements like Petrocaribe. Money
would continue to be deposited in the fund as long as the price of a
barrel of oil remained higher than US$100. The proposal was approved
and adopted in the summit's declaration which states "this fund
will be used to finance food and agricultural initiatives in member
countries with a view to achieving food security." It is thought
the fund will have an initial capital of US$450 million, although
this will depend on the international price of oil. <br>
<br>
The idea,
according to Chavez, is that as part of a Food Security Treaty, this
fund will be used to help member countries reactivate their
agricultural sectors, overcome shortages of basic grains and
compensate for the high price of basic foods as a result of the
global food crisis. During the Maracaibo summit the Council of
Agricultural Ministers of Petrocaribe was created to oversee the
proposed food security initiatives. <br>
<br>
As decided in Maracaibo,
this ministerial council met in Tegucigalpa on July 30 to discuss the
ideas further. In Tegucigalpa a range of issues and ideas were
discussed including the need for localized agricultural research
programs, how to make effective use of irrigation systems in
deforested areas and concrete examples of innovative integral
agricultural development programs. <br>
<br>
The reasons behind the
global food crisis were also discussed. Member country Agricultural
Ministers or their substitutes agreed that the current crisis would
not be resolved unless&nbsp;the US, Japan and Europe agree to
abolish
their exorbitant agricultural subsidies. The other main factors
contributing to the situation were defined as global population
growth, climate change, continued oil price increases and the use of
food to generate fuel. <br>
<br>
Also during the Tegucigalpa meeting
the Executive Technical Committee of the Council of Agricultural
Ministers was formed and the most recent meeting in Habana was
planned. The Executive Technical Committee is made up of experts and
government representatives from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras,
Surinam, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines. These experts (among them Nicaraguan Agricultural
Minister Ariel Bucardo) are responsible for drafting Petrocaribe's
Food Security Treaty and establishing mechanisms to administer
the&nbsp;petro-food fund.<br>
<br>
Among the measures and actions to
come out of the Habana meeting last week was the immediate
disbursement of US$2 million to each member country for the "most
urgent" food production and distribution projects, said
Venezuelan Agricultural Minister Elías Jaua. On top of this a
set of regulations to encourage prudent use of&nbsp;petro-food
funding was established and the proposal that participating countries
purchase&nbsp;fertilizer and other agricultural necessities jointly so
as to
reduce costs for farmers adopted. <br>
<br>
Minister Jaua also
announced the decision to create a grand-national - as opposed to multinational -
company, ALBA Foods, owned jointly by several countries. ALBA Foods would be responsible for carrying out the
policies to be agreed in Petrocaribe's Food Security Treaty.
Jaua explained that the Executive Technical
Committee&nbsp;timetabled
the tasks to be completed between now and December, when the VI
Petrocaribe Summit is scheduled to take place. This timetable
includes the founding of ALBA Foods and the evaluation and approval
of proposed projects for petro-food funding. <br>
<br>
During the
Habana meeting the Cuban Minister for Foreign Investment and Economic
Collaboration Marta Lomas Morales noted the speed with which the
Petrocaribe food security initiative has advanced. The progress made
over the last month demonstrates that "our countries are deeply
engaged in the search for alternatives with which to confront the
food crisis," she said.<br>
<br>
Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage
reminded those present that "the future is unlikely to be any
better [given that] oil is expected to run out in 40 years which will
provoke a lot of pressure to produce more biofuels from sugar and
corn. ... The rate of consumption in rich nations is exacerbating the
crisis in poor countries which have great difficulty feeding their
populations and paying their fuel bill," he went on. <br>
<br>
In
the light of such a difficult global context Lage emphasized the
potential for the petro-food fund "to go beyond a technical or
trade mechanism and to become a force for integration and solidarity"
which will help to "strengthen our governments' ability to
respond to increasing food prices."&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Petrocaribe's
solid discourse and
concrete actions are a breath of fresh air after all the bad faith rhetoric
and empty promises spouted by representatives of what the opposition
here in Nicaragua refer to as the "international community"
during the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization Summit in Rome two months ago.
