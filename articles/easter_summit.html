Varieties of imperial decline : fear and loathing in Port of Spain</span></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">

With only a few hours before the next Summit of the Americas, the
absence of Cuba from the meeting looms ever larger both as
anti-imperialist motif and as
an index of US decline. The over-riding issue at the Summit of the
Americas is going to be how far participating countries are prepared to
assert their sovereignty against the neo-colonial powers, represented
in at the summit by the United States and Canada. Already the US State
Department representative with responsibility for the summit, Jeffrey
Davidow, has tried to suggest that a draft of the final declaration for
the summit has already been agreed by all countries. </span><a style="font-family: sans-serif;" href="tortilla/node/281.html">The Nicaraguan
government swiftly issued a statement</a><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> contradicting Davidow.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Bearing that in mind and with the summit coming shortly after Easter it
is worth noting some remarks by the Irish columnist Tom McGurk on the
anti-imperialist significance of the Easter Rising in 1916. McGurk
wrote in his article "The Easter Rising : the shots that changed the
world forever" that the insurrection and its aftermath were "about
revealing the true nature of the colonial relationship to the Irish
people and thereby creating the imaginative context whereby sovereignty
could at last be imagined and then asserted." </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
That insight points to the nature of the anti-imperialist motif that
will find voice in Port of Spain via the scheduled intervention of
Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega speaking on behalf of Central
America as pro tempore president of the Central American Integration
System (SICA). US policy in Latin America, ever since hijacking Cuba's
independence before the 20th Century had even begun, has been one of
strangling Latin American countries' sovereignty. The constant media
war against Cuba, against Nicaragua in the 1980s, now against Hugo
Chavez, Evo Morales and Daniel Ortega, is the imperialist countries'
attempt to define and impose an imaginative context where sovereignty
cannot even be imagined, let alone asserted.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
That attempt will certainly be subverted and confounded in Port of
Spain this weekend where the main contentious issue will be US
relations with Cuba. At the recent SICA
summit in Managua all the Central American countries agreed a common
position on Cuba. Davidow and his team, in cahoots with the
Organization of American States, was trying to pre-empt any decisive
moment that might focus attention embarrassingly on the utter failure
of US policy not just towards Cuba but toward all of Latin America. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
That failure is part of a seamless web of US economic and political
failure that stretches over, trapping and constricting, almost every
aspect of US public life. The current crisis in the United States
constitutes an almost unprecedented historic betrayal of the people of
the United States. US foreign policy and economic failure have fed off
each other to create, too, a political crisis. That political crisis
consists of the US plutocrat elite holding the vast majority of US
citizens to ransom to make good the elite's corporate insolvency and
sustain their insanely counter-productive policy of global militarism.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
One of the purposes of the G-20 summit in London earlier in April was
to lend the political crisis in the United States a&nbsp; gloss of
solidarity and togetherness, in the various contemporary senses of that
word. The G-20 meeting ended with a completely fake commitment by the
US and Britain to police adequately the tax havens they control for
their illicit covert action and corporate money-laundering purposes.
The other main decision was to resuscitate the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) as imperialist enforcer, funding it with hundreds of
billions in
funny-money made up ad hoc by rich country central banks. The meeting
in Port of Spain is unlikely to be as cosy and downright deceitful as
the one in London.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa expressed the feeling of many when he
said recently,"It seems to me a very serious error they are commiting,
trying to revive the IMF, using it supposedly
to solve the crisis, help emerging economies, when it is one of the
bodies primarily responsible for the crisis and the backwardness of
those emerging economies." (Aporrea.org, April 14th 2009). Correa is
one of the prime movers of economic integration in South America and of
more radical international financial reform. Even Brazil's social
democrat President Ignacio da Silva seems to support calls from Russia
and China for a new international reserve currency to replace the US
dollar.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
But in any case, while China and Russia may have smiled and made
nicey-nice with their G-7 counterparts in London, they continue, as
they have done for a long time, to work out alternative strategies to
cooperation with the imperialist Western Bloc countries. In Latin
America they continue to promote trade and investment links that
constitute a different track to their more conventional international
economic relationships with European and North American trade and
finance partners. China has recently made significant deals with
trading partners like Indonesia and Argentina using swap arrangements
that permit those countries to pay for Chinese goods in their own
currency and vice versa. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The group of Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) countries
led by Venezuela and Cuba have invited Russia to take on observer
status - joining Ecuador, Uruguay and Haiti. ALBA has also experimented
with barter trade arrangements which its member countries may well
extend to their trading with Russia and China. Russia is currently
negotiating major purchases of sea-food products and beef from
Nicaragua, allowing that country to help those important sectors of its
economy recover from lost exports to North America. Brazil continues to
develop its aerospace industry via relations with both Russia and
China. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Perhaps the recent diplomatic and trade visits by President Hugo Chavez
of Venezuela mark the most emphatic shift towards developing dynamic
South-South trade relations. In April this year, President Chavez
visited Doha for a summit meeting of South American and Arab
governments. He subsequently visited Iran, Japan and China signing
major agreements with all those countries's governments. Iran and
Venezuela have set up a joint Iranian-Venezuelan Bank. In Japan, the
Japanese government undertook commitments to develop energy projects in
Venezuela over the next few years worth over US$30 billion. In Beijing,
President Chavez and his team reviewed progress on joint projects with
China in Venezuela worth US$26 billion.
</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Also going on at the same time as all this global trade activity, the
ALBA countries - Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Dominica - are pushing ahead with their proposal not just to develop
their ALBA bank, essentially their own development bank, but also with
a common currency. This currency, called the Sistema Unico de
Compensación Regional (Sucre), would be a unit of account and of
value similar to the forerunner of the Euro, the European Currency
Unit. At their summit this week immediately prior to the Port of Spain
summit, the ALBA countries are likely to deepen and extend their
commitments vis-a-vis both the ALBA bank and the Sucre </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The fundamental economic backdrop to all these developments is the
illegitimate US domination of global trade via its fiat global
currency, the dollar. As </span><a style="font-family: sans-serif;" href="http://henryckliu.com/page185.html">Henry
C.K.Liu puts it</a><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> "when buyers are located in different countries
from sellers and trade is denominated in the buyer's fiat currency due
to currency hegemony, trade is predatory in favor of the buyer even if
the balance of payments is in favor of the seller." Liu also points out
later on in that essay that developing countries are by this point
totally exasperated at the fake claim that corporate consumer
capitalism is in any way capable of poverty reduction because poverty
reduction contradicts so-called "market efficiency". The vast rich
country aid and development cooperation shambles is deliberately
exploited to camouflage that basic truth.
</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Countries that are no longer prepared to tolerate those deep
contradictions in the global corporate capitalist system are not going
to wait for Europe and the North America to reinflate their financial
sectors with bloated fake asset prices again. The systemic fraud on
which corporate finance driven capitalism is operated will necessarily
again destabilize global markets causing food and energy prices to
spike again as they did so grotesquely through the end of 2007 until
mid-2008. The failure of the G-20 summit in London to address the
crisis effectively may well be another point of contention in Port of
Spain. The more progressive governments - the ALBA countries, Ecuador
and perhaps some Caribbean nations - will probably note that
developing countries did not cause the debacle in the rich country
economies and yet are likely to suffer disproportionately as a result.
</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
When all the guff and froth from Port of Spain has drifted away, plenty
will remain for Latin American countries to sort out. Will Venezuela
and Ecuador continue dithering, hoping Brazil will finally get its
finger out and promote the Bank of the South in a decisive serious way?
Or will Ecuador finally decide to throw in
its lot with the ALBA countries and build up the ALBA Bank? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
What will
the ALBA bank be - a development bank or a regional lender of last
resort as well?
Will ALBA create the first currency region beyond the reach of the
major
international financial institutions? How long will the underlying
common cause between the ALBA countries
and Brazil - the defence of Latin American sovereignty - last, before
conflicting agendas provoke a rift? The effectively stymied Bank of the
South shows the problems regional differences, especially Brazil's
ambitions, can provoke. Will a
post-Ignacio da Silva government signal an active US-Brazilian axis
rather than the divided-self-interest that has characterised Brazil's
foreign policy recently? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
In Central America, one interesting barometer
of pressure for radical change will be the policy decisions taken by El
Salvador's president-elect Mauricio Funes, an openly enthusiastic
admirer of da Silva. Elsewhere, while there is unlikely to be much
change in US policy towards Cuba, events in Mexico and Colombia and to
a lesser extent in Peru will also tell a great deal about how Latin
America's shifting centres of gravity are likely to settle in the short
while before the next round of elections in the region. Looked at from
Americas, Barack Obama's electoral slogans "change" and "yes we can"
are
well worn clichés. South of the Rio Grande, most people have had
their fill of trite promises of "Cambio" and "Sí, se
puede..."</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
