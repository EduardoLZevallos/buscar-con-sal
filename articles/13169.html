<h3><strong>The COVID Agenda Is Part of a U.S. Hegemonic Project</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<p><em>The COVID crisis engineered by the financial establishment is part of a hegemonic project, pertaining to control over strategic sectors of the global economy.</em></p>

<p><em>The unspoken truth is that the novel coronavirus provides a pretext and a justification to powerful financial interests and </em><em>corrupt politicians to precipitate the entire World into a spiral of mass unemployment, bankruptcy, extreme poverty and despair. </em></p>

<p><em><i>An unelected “public-private partnership” under the auspices of the World Economic Forum (WEF), has come to the rescue of  Planet Earth’s 7.9 billion people. The closure of the global economy is presented as a means to “killing the virus”. </i></em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/martinez-de-hoz-rockefeller-videla.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5326723 alignright" height="175" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px" src="https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/martinez-de-hoz-rockefeller-videla.jpg" srcset="https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/martinez-de-hoz-rockefeller-videla.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/martinez-de-hoz-rockefeller-videla-120x80.jpg 120w" width="263" /></a>This hegemonic project consists in adopting <strong style="font-style: italic;">The Great Reset</strong> under the helm of what the late <a href="https://www.aspentimes.com/news/beware-new-world-order/"><strong style="font-style: italic;">David Rockefeller</strong></a> entitled “<strong style="font-style: italic;">Supranational Sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers</strong>“. This “alliance” according to Rockefeller is “preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries.”</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Image on the right: David Rockefelle</strong>r meets Argentina’s military dictator<strong> General Jorge Videla</strong> (right) (mid 1970s)</span></p>

<p>This diabolical project consists in scrapping representative democracy and the Nation State in favour of a New World Order dominated by the financial elites and their “selected intellectual partners”.</p>

<h2><strong>Planet Inc.</strong></h2>

<p>What is ongoing is a process of concentration of wealth (and control of advanced technologies) unprecedented in World history, whereby the financial establishment is slated to appropriate the real assets of both bankrupt companies in all major sectors of economic activity as well as State assets.</p>

<p>What we are witnessing is the outright privatization of the Nation State, integrated by corrupt politicians who are controlled by a gamut of global creditors and financial institutions.</p>

<p><strong>Economic and Social Warfare</strong></p>

<p>The COVID crisis is an act of Worldwide economic and social warfare. A massive concentration of wealth is ongoing.</p>

<p>The entire fabric and institutions of civil society are in jeopardy including national health care, schools, colleges and universities. All avenues of social and cultural life are affected.</p>

<p>People’s lives are destroyed.</p>

<p>The Worldwide impacts on mental health are devastating. Anxiety and depression resulting from unemployment and loss of income is a Worldwide phenomenon, unprecedented in World history.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Foreign Policy</strong></p>

<p>This project is an integral part of President Joe Biden’s foreign policy agenda. It has geopolitical and strategic implications.</p>

<p>US intelligence and the Pentagon (including DARPA) as well as NATO are directly or indirectly involved in the corona crisis. The Military Industrial Complex, Big Pharma, the Bio Tech and IT conglomerates are partners, in liaison with the World Economic Forum (WEF) which is in the process of taking control of the United Nations.</p>

<p>The WHO “Guidelines” for issuing so-called <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Digital_certificates-vaccination-data_dictionary-2021.1">“Digital Certificates for Covid-19” are generously funded by the Rockefeller and Bill and Melinda Gates foundations.</a></p>

<p>The March 11, 2020 lockdown leading to closure of national economies Worldwide has also been instrumental in destabilizing several countries which are categorized as “Enemies of America”.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-5755082" height="194" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" src="https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/killer-covid-vaccine-1024x816.png" srcset="https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/killer-covid-vaccine-1024x816.png 1024w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/killer-covid-vaccine-1024x816-300x239.png 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/killer-covid-vaccine-1024x816-768x612.png 768w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/killer-covid-vaccine-1024x816-400x319.png 400w" width="243" />No need for Washington to impose piecemeal sanctions on Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. These countries and their governments have endorsed the COVID narrative. They have endorsed the <strong>“ultimate sanction”</strong>, namely the closure of their national economy coupled with the acceptance of the <strong>COVID killer vaccine</strong> as means to combating <strong>“V the virus”</strong>.</p>

<p>And unfortunately progressive intellectuals are totally blind. They are not only supportive of the COVID narrative, they fail to understand how the COVID lockdown policies as well as the deadly mRNA vaccine are being used to destabilize and destroy countries one after the other.</p>

<p>Engineered economic and social chaos. These countries are now fully controlled by Western creditors.</p>

<p>In the US, the billionaires (including Bezos, Musk, Gates and Zuckerberg) have increased their wealth by more than 60% since the outset of the pandemic, “from just short of $3 trillion at the start of the COVID crisis on March 18, 2020, to $4.8 trillion on August 17, 2021”.

<h2><strong>Bastille 2.0: “Real Regime Change”</strong></h2>

<p><strong>What is the solution? </strong></p>

<p>The complexities of this crisis must be addressed including the power structures of global capitalism.</p>

<p>What must also be understood are the astute mechanisms including threats and bribes which are used systematically to take control not only of corrupt politicians but of the entire governmental fabric of what used to be called “sovereign countries”.</p>

<p>Is a second Worldwide lockdown contemplated? We must ensure that it does not take place, which means that we must confront the powers of so-called “global governance”.</p>

<p>Protest movements must question the legitimacy of both the financial actors as well as the politicians in high office.</p>

<p>This network must be established (nationally and internationally) at all levels of society, in towns and villages, work places, parishes. Trade unions, farmers organizations, professional associations, business associations, student unions, veterans associations, church groups would be called upon to integrate this movement.</p>

<p><strong>The first task would be to disable the fear campaign and media disinformation as well as put an end to Big Pharma’s COVID vaccination programme.</strong></p>

<p>The corporate media should be directly challenged, without specifically targeting mainstream journalists, many of whom have been instructed to abide by the official narrative. This endeavour would require a parallel process at the grassroots level, of sensitizing and educating fellow citizens on the nature of virus, the impacts of the vaccine and the lockdown.</p>

<p>“Spreading the word” through social media and independent online media outlets will be undertaken bearing in mind that Google as well as Facebook are instruments of censorship.</p>

<p>The creation of such a movement, which forcefully challenges the legitimacy of the financial elites as well as the structures of political authority at the national level, is no easy task. <strong>It will require a degree of solidarity, unity and commitment unparalleled in World history.</strong></p>

<p>It will also require breaking down political and ideological barriers within society (i.e. between political parties) and <strong>acting with a single voice</strong>.</p>

<p>We must also understand that the “corona project” is an integral part of the U.S. imperial agenda. It has geopolitical and strategic implications. It will also require eventually unseating the architects of this diabolical “pandemic” and indicting them for crimes against humanity.

<p>What is required is a “real regime change”, the restoration of democracy and what used to be called “The Welfare State”.</p>

<p>Solidarity must prevail. A complex task and commitment ahead for all humanity.</p>
