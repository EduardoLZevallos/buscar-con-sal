"These puddles are full of our tears" :&nbsp; <br>A summary of the
government's main road construction projects </span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">by Karla Jacobs, 1 de junio 2009</span><br>

"These puddles are not full of rain water but of our tears," one woman
commented to Infrastructure Minister Fernando Martínez during
the event marking the beginning of construction work on the road to
Huehuete (Carazo). "When we have to tramp through the mud carrying our
children and what little produce we have, or when we have to carry a
sick person to the hospital and he dies on the way because no vehicle
could come to get him, ... then we cry and cry. These puddles are full
of our tears."<br>
<br>
When the FSLN government came to power in January 2007 it inherited a
country whose infrastructure was on its knees. A very significant
proportion of the Nicaraguan population lives in areas inaccessible by
vehicle at any time of the year. During the heavy rains of the rainy
season, however, a state of true chaos reigns in many parts of the
country when, in&nbsp;many areas, the population are regularly cut off from
all basic services as roads become impassible even on horseback or by
foot. The FSLN government has been working for over two years now to
increase accessibility in rural and semi rural-areas with special
emphasis on productive areas and potential tourist areas.<br>
<br>
On May 25th Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Fernando
Martínez was interviewed by journalist Alberto Mora on Channel
4's morning program "Revista En Vivo." During the interview Martinez
gave details about the different road construction projects already
finished or being carried out by the Ministry of Transport and
Infrastructure (MTI). Below is a summary of the information provided
by Minister Fernandez Martinez during the interview, which was not intended to give a complete list of MTI
projects.<br>
<br>
Work on the much awaited road linking Acoyapa and San Carlos in the southern department of Rio San Juan&nbsp; should
begin later this year and take 16 months to complete. The construction
of this stretch of road is being financed with a loan from the Inter
American Development Bank (BID) for US$51.7 million. The total amount
of road to be construced measures 125 kilometers. This road links the
region on the south eastern shore of Lake Nicaragua (Lake Cocibolca) to
a road leading to the market town Juigalpa and on to Managua. Four
additional stretches of road linking the main road to other towns in
the region will be paved as part of a simultaneous project financed by
the Central American Economic Integration Bank (BCIE). This additional
project has a total cost of US$10 million. The Japanese government has
donated funds to cover the cost of the construction of a stretch of
road linking San Carlos on to Las Tablillas which borders with Costa
Rica. This additional construction includes a 220 meter long bridge
over River San Juan. The departments benefiting as a result of these
projects, Chontales and Rio San Juan, are major producers of rice,
corn, beans, plantains, dairy products and beef, among others. The area
also has great potential for tourism development.<br>
<br>
The BCIE also financed the almost completed construction of a 60.4km
long stretch of road linking San Isidro (Matagalapa) to Malpasillo
(Leon) thus providing vital but previously lacking safe and dependable
communication between the north western regions of Nicaragua without
the need to travel first via Managua.<br>
<br>
With funding from the currently suspended US government Millenium
Challenge Account the road linking Leon with the seaside towns of
Poneloya and Las Peñitas was built. These two town possess great
potential as tourist attractions.<br>
<br>
Among other towns with potential for tourism development and towns
already established as tourist attractions to be benefited by MTI road
construction projects are San Juan del Sur and La Virgen in Rivas, and
Casares and La Boquita in Carazo. The roads linking these towns to the
country's main road system were financed by the World Bank, as is the
ongoing project linking San Juan del Río Coco and Telpaneca to
Palacagüina in the northern department of Madriz, a major corn and
beans producing region.<br>
<br>
With its own funds the main project the MTI has financed over the last
two years is the reconstruction of the road between Matagalpa and
Jinotega, the two main towns in the north central coffee producing
region. <br>
<br>
The other major project the MTI has taken on since the FSLN came to
power is the construction of a highway linking Bilwi (formerly Puerto
Cabezas, capital of the
Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region, RAAN) on the Caribbean coast with
Rio Blanco in Matagalpa, a project that will be funded in part by the
BCIE. This 300 km long dirt road has always been neglected, but
deteriorated significantly&nbsp;during the previous neo-liberal
governments due to
an almost complete lack of investment. Constructing the highway is
a major engineering
project given the marshland
quality of the terrain. The Venezuelan Army Corp of Engineers is
involved in assessing the viability of the project. Although the
highway construction project has not advanced as quickly as first
expected, progress has been made with the reconstruction of 40 bridges
(with funds donated by the Danish government) and work on the worst
part of the route located near the town of Siuna. This part of the road
is made up of various stretches of "pegaderos" totalling ovewr 16km,
impassable even by the
sturdiest vehicle during the heaviest rains. <br>
<br>
Dozens of other smaller road construction / reconstruction projects
across the country have already been completed, are ongoing or are in
the process of being planned. Among the more populous towns to be
benefitted as a result are San Francisco Libre, La Libertad, San Pedro
de Lóvago and Santo Tomás. Indeed the government's road
construction plan has been so ambitious that the Nicaraguan paving
block companies' production has been overwhelmed. According to Minister
Martínez, this, rather than MTI inefficiency, is the principle
cause for holdups in road projects over the last two years. <br></td>
