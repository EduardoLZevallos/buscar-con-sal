<h4><em><strong>Era Biden: USA-Nicaragua - End of demonization?</strong></em></h4>

<p><strong><em> (Part one)</em></strong><br />
<br />
I<br />
The outgoing president of the United States did not allow the clear water of potable relations with Nicaragua to run along. He preferred the rotten mud of conscientious infamies, manipulations and deceptions, provided by a bunch of Nicaraguan gold diggers who profit at the expense of the American people.</p>

<p>From that devil's clay, Donald Trump molded, at his convenience, a hollow artisan version of Nicaragua that is not at all like the original, to accuse it of being an “unusual and extraordinary threat to the US National Security and foreign policy”.</p>

<p>Even a right-wing person, from his ideological igloo detached from the old Cold War, knows why Trump is given to bake that kind of disfigured and monochromatic pots, cooked in the heat of arbitrariness to replace the vivid colors and dimensions of truth. There is his same complaint of "electoral fraud" in the American Union.</p>

<p>His fascination for the delirious distortion of the truth is due to the fact that he is "an overwhelming and arrogant person, who lies and exaggerates," explains the writer Carlos Alberto Montaner.</p>

<p>"The ‘trumpologists’" - he concluded – have counted more than twenty thousand lies, distortions of reality or "post-truths" from him.</p>

<p>Draw your conclusions!</p>

<p>If the little "dangerous" country was to destine its entire 2021 expenditures to try to acquire the New York Yankees, it wouldn't even be able to swing at it.</p>

<p>Not even the High Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, would give it a second thought.</p>

<p>Why even bother with the Nica offer, if it would not even be close to US $ 2.5 billion?</p>

<p>The most valuable franchise in the Big Tent, reported AP last April, is valued by Forbes magazine at $ 5 billion. The expenditures of the Central American nation will amount to just US $ 2,328 million. Such are the effects of the disaster caused by the highly paid local human miserable.</p>

<p>Armed violence, emanating from the deliquescent code of ethics of those who tried to carry out a coup in 2018 against a government that emerged from the polls, reached 9 Ritcher degrees of devastation on the Open Scale of Hate.</p>

<p>Today, Nicaragua is unable to mantain a single MLB team.</p>

<p>So how is it that with a Budget that doesn't even tickle the legendary blunderbuss of the Manhattan Mules, it constitutes an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to America?<br />
Even if it had its entire economy for operating the State, US $ 4,681 million, the numbers don’t give, worse now with the aftermath of two devastating hurricanes in a row, Eta and Iota.</p>

<p>And if the numbers don’t give, neither the words of the Trump administration to justify its swampy policy against the motherland of Rubén Darío.</p>

<p>The only certainty of all this is that it has enriched an undemocratic bunch of profiteers, whose vile slogan is to destroy their homeland. Surely now they forget their finances and begin to flatter the victorious Democrat. It wouldn't be strange.</p>

<p>If 200 years of Independence have been of any use in real life, it is to realize what the galleons of the Spanish Empire spawned in these latitudes: a prudish breed of scoundrels - and its court of huddled peas - specialist in greed, absolute lack of mercy, intrigue and, most of all, betrayal. Such is the "illustrious" cradle of those that History baptizes with a single name: Traitors.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Why so much demonization towards Nicaragua?</p>

<p>There is no totalitarianism. The free market prevails. Respect for property, business and investments. Transparency in the execution of disbursements allocated by multilateral development agencies. In addition, among other advances, reduction of extreme poverty and a healthy average economic growth of 5%, until the attempted coup in 2018.</p>

<p>The State does not have an official ideology or religion, although certain public officials keep Catholic holidays. For years, successive surveys by M&amp;R, and others, have concluded that the Catholic Church is not the majority creed. Last May, the firm established that 42.9% of the Nicaraguan population is Catholic.</p>

<p>The Evangelical Church and Nondenominational Believers congregate the new majority: 54.5%. Other non-Christian beliefs sum up 2.3%.</p>

<p>Therefore, now the pastorals, letters and other publications, or confessional celebrations, cannot assume, dictatorially, the national representativeness, the voice, the conscience and the culture of the Nicaraguan people. As the Chilean Julio Numhauser sang, "Change, everything changes."</p>

<p>The Sandinista Front also experienced changes. By historical evolution, it is not the same as the 1980s. At that time there was aggression by the Ronald Reagan government, but not all misfortunes have the actor's mark in his role as sheriff of the world. One part bears the stamp of the opportunists. When they saw that the ship was sinking, as it corresponds to their gray character, they abandoned it ...</p>

<p>… And those who straightened the course of the ship remained. Those who publicly apologized for their own mistakes, and the mistakes and deification of others. Those who instead of resentment, proposed mutual understanding. Those who show a vision of nation, solidarity and efficiency in public affairs. Those who recognize that democracy and institutions must be improved.</p>

<p>It is not about idealizing Sandinism. A party of men and women, does not install the Kingdom of Heaven, much less the opposite. It is a government with the virtues and the errors of the human condition. But if it managed to return to power, it is because God “changes times and seasons; He deposes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to the wise” (Daniel 2:21).</p>

<p>The "ultra Marxist" demigods who wanted to "purify" the country with a "single party" left after the electoral defeat of 1990.</p>

<p>The irresponsible extremists who so damaged the country with their equestrian obsession to squeeze the spurs of the Directorate-National-Order to the people. And, among them, the one who, in his capacity as director of the official organ of the Sandinista Front, Barricade, and of the Department of Agitation and Propaganda, DAP, editorialized about the need to put a “bridle” on his own mother's newspaper, “La Prensa SA ”. (Bridle, f. Brake of the horse with the reins and all the harness that serves to hold it from the head of the animal. RAE).</p>

<p>Those who destroyed the food basket of Central America with its “planned economy” left, those that caused hyperinflation and, as “extra”, the shortage of basic consumer products for the population.</p>

<p>Those who ordered to confiscate from a pound of beans from the peasant at the roadblocks to the unjust usurpation of real estate, left.</p>

<p>Those who broke the productive apparatus with its Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform left, and caused the first climate change in the history of Nicaragua: the catastrophic felling of shade coffee plantations, carried out by the National Commission for the Renewal of Coffee Plantations, CONARCA. Result: the dispossession of the Carazo department of its healthy and very fresh environment.</p>

<p>The general and his "military doctrine" left, without regretting having mandatorily sent 16-year-old boys to war, praised by the "intellectuals" of the DAP with their unfortunate slogan: "Without a youth willing to sacrifice, there is no Revolution".</p>

<p>They left with their Minister of Education who wanted to reduce that sensitive portfolio into a national indoctrination system.</p>

<p>Finally, they left to form the top-down movement of resentful and other self-proclaimed "dissidents", judging themselves as the "pure", "thinkers", "true Sandinistas", those who never even made the "mistake" of throwing a firecracker to a dog.</p>

<p>Those who never admitted to history and the Nicaraguan people their grave responsibilities in the deterioration of Nicaragua, yesterday and today, left.</p>

<p>They left with their dictatorship - which at the height of imposture they attribute to the FSLN - to impose it wherever they go, for example, the roadblocks of 2018.</p>

<p>They "enlightened" who without the slightest moral quality attribute the right to rule and sentence, absolve and punish left, those who do not agree with their nonsense, megalomania and pedantic cynicism or ... vicecinism.</p>

<p>The great "anti-imperialists" of the MRS and Company, who yesterday tried to hide their mediocre performance in ministries, companies and autonomous entities, and in the military institution, blaming everything on the war, Reagan and the CIA; and now, to top it off, on President Daniel Ortega.</p>

<p>Yes, thank God the truffles (hypocrites and false) left the FSLN, those who boasted of being "The Vatican of the Left-wing" and are now rented - from their uninhabited acronyms, multimedia pamphlets and NGO´s - as "The Holy See of the Democracy".</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>President-elect Joe Biden proclaimed that he will work to heal the soul of America after "this grim age of demonization in America begins to end."</p>

<p>For now, it is time to rebuild the bonds of this great country with Latin America. Let's not say, with respect to Nicaragua. These relationships have been marked with interventions and interference that would not have been possible without the despicable role of the traitors - as active now as never before - who promoted what Darío already in his days called "the fatal pages of history."</p>

<p>Going against the very Constitution of the United States of America, the Administration defeated on November 3 tried to dissolve the Republic of Nicaragua, to turn the country into an unfortunate third-rate colony.</p>

<p>To achieve this, they applied the heartless "democratic advocacy" - under the cover of "human rights" - an infamous euphemism used to overthrow the Constitutional Government that meant burning people alive. It meant torture. It meant hijacked cities. It meant violation of the human rights of those kidnapped at the armed roadblocks. It meant persecution, robbery and blackmail of citizens. It meant "peaceful protests" by paramilitary squads.</p>

<p>In short, it meant a criminal attack against Democracy: everything that the OAS omitted in its slanderous misinformation, made to the measure of who put Luis Almagro at the head of the hemispheric carpentry of baseness.</p>
