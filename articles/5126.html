<p><b>DECLARATION </b><b>OF THE 24TH ALBA-TCP POLITICAL COUNCIL </b> <b> </b></p>

<p>We, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples' Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP), gathered with the purpose of <i>“defend the independence, sovereignty, self- determination and identity of the countries of the Alliance against attempts at political, economic and digital domination”,</i> on the occasion of the 24th Political Council, held within the framework of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UN):</p>

<p>1. Are aware of the unavoidable responsibility of our governments in fighting to meet the needs and defending the interests of our peoples, to whom we have a duty to serve, in accordance with the constitutional frameworks and the respect for the International Law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>2. Reject the political and military offensive, including through the deployment of foreign military bases in Latin America and the Caribbean, as a result of agreements promoted with countries in the region, which threats to peace, security and stability in the region and represents a serious obstacle to the shared purposes of regional union and integration, contrary to the premises of the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace.</p>

<p>3. Condemn the coup d'état attempts by different means, which have been plotted throughout this year, to interfere in the internal affairs of the Latin American and Caribbean countries, as in the case of Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia and Honduras, to cause destabilization and impose policies contrary to the will of our nations.</p>

<p>4. Reject the disrespectful attempts of some nations to implement the use of criminal justice (lawfare) against political and ideological opponents, disrespecting the basic content of their procedural guarantees, seeking to undermine their credibility, destabilize democratically elected governments in the region and hinder the legality and legitimacy of social transformation processes. We repudiate the current situation of former Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas and the violation of the right to political asylum to which he is legally entitled.</p>

<p>5. Demand from the government of the United States of America an urgent and unconditional change in its hostile and criminal policy towards the sister Republic of Cuba. We reiterate the call of the United Nations General Assembly to immediately cease the illegal economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America against the Republic of Cuba.</p>

<p>6. Demand the immediate exclusion of Cuba from the arbitrary and unilateral list of countries that allegedly sponsor terrorism, issued by the U.S. Department of State, which intensifies to unprecedented levels the economic siege against that country, with serious consequences for its population.</p>

<p>7. Demand the immediate lifting of unilateral coercive measures against the peoples and governments of Nicaragua and Venezuela, in violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and International Law. We consider the decision of the United Nations General Assembly to be a step forward, although it is not enough, on taking into account the item “Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial coercive measures used as a means of political and economic coercion” every two years.</p>

<p>8. Stand firm in our solidarity with the people and Government of Nicaragua amidst the permanent aggression, perpetrated by the Government of the United States in its efforts to threaten the peace, stability and well-being achieved by the Nicaraguan people.</p>

<p>9. Congratulate President Nicolás Maduro Moros for his reelection on July 28, in a civic and democratic day and support all his efforts to provide the Venezuelan people with the peace and well-being they deserve, despite the ongoing internal and external attacks to cause chaos and destabilization.</p>

<p>10. Repudiate the Palestinian genocide and the invasion of their territory by Israel, the occupying power. We demand, once again, the immediate cessation of the illegal occupation of the territories and their return to the dignified Palestinian people. We call for the morale of the international community not to recognize the territorial, legal and demographic consequences of the occupation of Palestinian lands contrary to international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, violate international peace and security and threaten the very existence of humanity.</p>

<p>11. In view of the fascist wave unleashed in Our America, we agree on the need to create the Great Anti-Fascist International, unanimously approved at the World Congress against Fascism, Neo-Fascism and Similar Expressions, held in Caracas with the participation of representatives of parties, social movements and other political groups from over 95 countries of the world.</p>

<p>12. Recognize the need to work in a broader manner in the natural disaster and catastrophe risk prevention and reduction, developing practical, inclusive and accessible policies. We welcome the initiative for the creation of the ALBA-TCP Risk and Disaster Management System and we are committed to make progress in its implementation.</p>

<p>13. Express our concern over the effects of the climate crisis, especially in the Caribbean countries and we applaud the holding of the Fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in Antigua and Barbuda and the adoption of its declaration “Charting a Course for Resilient Prosperity,” to join efforts and continue working to achieve sustainable development, in areas such as climate change, and other key sectors to ensure the well-being of the people, such as economy, tourism and food security.</p>

<p>14. Reaffirm our support for the Caribbean countries in their demand for a just, special and differentiated treatment, and for reparations for the damages of slavery and colonialism.</p>

<p>15. Agree to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 ALBA- TCP Strategic Agenda, joining efforts, political will and firm actions in each of the Alliance's countries to achieve the goals set out in the different horizons of the Agenda.</p>

<p>16. Urge the national coordinators of the Alliance, in their role of the first permanent contacts for political consultation and effective exchange to ensure a prioritized follow-up of the actions aimed at achieving the goals agreed upon in the Agenda.</p>

<p>17. Agree that each country of the Alliance will appoint two youth leaders to constitute Alba Youth, to participate in the activities of the Alliance and bring their contributions to be presented to the Heads of State and Government, in accordance with paragraph 3.5 of the 2030 ALBA-TCP Strategic Agenda.</p>

<p>18. Value the importance of the implementation of the ALBA-TCP Development Cooperation Agency, as a body of our Alliance that will help developing the essential areas for the well-being of our peoples, diversifying our economies and strengthening our productive capacities. We support and accompany the ALBA-TCP Executive Secretariat in all its actions to make this important initiative a reality.</p>

<p>19. Highlight the importance of people's diplomacy that promotes and encourages the valuable participation of Latin American and Caribbean social movements in the initiatives of the Alliance. After the convening of the World Social Alternative as well as the preparatory meeting of the Council of Social Movements of ALBA- TCP, as a first step towards the definitive constitution of a space for meeting and debate, from which concrete initiatives will emerge directly from the demands of the peoples for the ALBA-TCP Heads of State and Government.</p>

<p>20. We express our satisfaction with the holding of the “Caribbean Regional Seminar on the Implementation of the Fourth International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism”, in Caracas, as a demonstration of the commitment of the countries of the Alliance to the defense of sovereignty and the processes of decolonization in the world, as well as we are very delighted with the holding of “Drums of Alba: Beats of our Identity”, which allowed for the exchange of experiences and the expression of the rich cultural diversity of the region. We will continue to promote the cultural activities of the Alliance countries, as a life-transforming element that contributes to the physical and mental health of our peoples.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that only together we can face the serious political, economic and social challenges of the current regional and international scenarios, and we reaffirm our commitment to the strengthening of ALBA-TCP, based on the principles of solidarity, social justice, cooperation and economic complementarity. This December 14th, the Alliance celebrates its 20th anniversary. The summit in Havana should be the scenario for making structural decisions on the functioning of ALBA to adapt its work to the New Era in which humanity is living and to the hostile environment of a declining imperialism. The ALBA-TCP Executive Secretariat will present to the governments in the coming months, innovative and necessary proposals for review, adjustment and transformation to make our Alliance more useful for our peoples 20 years after its bright foundation.</p>
