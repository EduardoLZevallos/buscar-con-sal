      <br>
There have been two significant developments this month in the ongoing
dispute provoked by Costa Rica over Nicaragua&#8217;s project to dredge the
last 30 kilometres of River San Juan. Firstly, on January 10th the
preliminary hearing of the case brought against Nicaragua by Costa Rica
at the International Court of Justice took place. Secondly,
representatives of both countries took part in a meeting in Mexico on
January 17th aimed at facilitating a diplomatic solution to the dispute.<br>
      <br>
During the preliminary hearing at the International Court of Justice in
the Hague between January 10th and 13th both countries presented their
arguments as part of the case brought against Nicaragua in November
2010. Costa Rica accuses its northern neighbour of occupying Costa
Rican territory in October as part of the ongoing dredging operation of
the Nicaraguan River San Juan. Costa Rica also claims that Nicaragua
has provoked environmental damage to Costa Rican territory as a result
of the dredging operation.<br>
      <br>
According to Nicaragua&#8217;s representative at the world court, Carlos
Arguello, however, the results of the preliminary hearing were
&#8220;formidable&#8221; from Nicaragua&#8217;s perspective, demonstrating his remarks
with the fact that Costa Rica was forced to modify its request for the
court to approve &#8220;provisional measures&#8221; following the solid counter
arguments presented by the Nicaraguan defence on January 11th:<br>
      <br>
While Costa Rica&#8217;s argument to back up its territorial claim to the 2.7
kilometres of swamp under scrutiny are based on historical maps which
clearly stated that they had not been verified on the ground,
Nicaragua&#8217;s claims to the area are based on the Alexander Arbitral
Awards of 1896 and the Cleveland Award of 1888 which the International
Court of Justice upheld as the valid interpretation of this area of the
Costa Rican Nicaraguan border in a ruling in 2009.<br>
      <br>
During an interview with a Nicaraguan TV news program Arguello said he
and his colleagues feel confident that the International Court will not
grant the provisional measures requested by Costa Rica (among other
things that Nicaragua does not allow its soldiers to enter the area
Costa Rica claims is part of its territory again) due to the weakness
of the Costa Rican delegates&#8217; legal arguments. <br>
      <br>
The Nicaraguan representative went on to say that he does not expect a
ruling to be issued on the matter for at least a month and a half
commenting that the fact the court is taking its time on the case in
hand suggests that, contrary to the impression the Costa Rican
government is trying to create, the World Court does not view the case
as &#8220;urgent.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
One interesting detail to come out of the preliminary hearing was the
Costa Rican team&#8217;s claim that Managua is planning to build some sort of
&#8220;major channel&#8221; in the border area, a construction which Costa Rica
says could provoke significant environmental damage. <br>
      <br>
Arguello dismissed this claim as ridiculous describing what the Costa
Ricans insist is &#8220;a channel&#8221; as a canal that has existed for centuries
if not millennia and forms part of the river&#8217;s natural course. Again
the Nicaraguan team&#8217;s argument is backed up by the Alexander Arbitral
Award which clearly determines the existence of the canal in
1886.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
As part of the current Nicaragua dredging operation, Arguello went on,
the canal, which had closed up over time, has been cleared &#8211; an
undertaking which involved the felling of approximately 180 trees so as
to encourage the river&#8217;s water to flow into the last stretch of the
river in Nicaraguan territory. According to the Nicaraguan defence,
that part of the operation has now been completed and the government
has no plans to carry out any further work on the canal apart from
reforesting the area with 10 new trees for each one cut down. <br>
      <br>
Subsequently on January 17th representatives of the governments of both
Central American nations took part in a meeting in the Mexican city of
Cuernavaca which was facilitated by the governments of Mexico and
Guatemala and which was hoped would be the first step in bringing about
a diplomatic solution to the ongoing dispute between Nicaragua and
Costa Rica. <br>
      <br>
Back in December Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom met with his
Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Managua to discuss, among other
things, the possibility of the Guatemalan government&#8217;s support in
pursuing the possibility of unconditional dialogue between Nicaragua
and Costa Rica as a means of promoting a diplomatic solution to the
dispute. Both men agreed to work together towards this possibility.<br>
      <br>
At the Central American Integration System (SICA) summit in Belize
later the same month President Colom succeeded in encouraging support
for the initiative of unconditional dialogue including an agreement
from the Costa Rican government to take part in such an endeavour and a
commitment from the Mexican government to help facilitate and host the
first meeting. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua was represented at the subsequent January 17th meeting by the
country&#8217;s ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS),
Denis Moncada, the legal advisor to the Foreign Ministry, Cesar Vega,
the Nicaraguan Ambassador to Mexico, Horacio Brenes, and the Nicaraguan
Army&#8217;s legal advisor, Walter Molina. <br>
      <br>
Costa Rica was represented by its Foreign Ministry&#8217;s Central America
Coordinator, Melvin Saenz, Director of Foreign Policy at the Foreign
Ministry, Estela Blanca Solis, Foreign Ministry legal advisor, Carlos
Vargas Pizarro, and the Costa Rican Ambassador in Mexico Gabriela
Jimenez.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The Guatemalan and Mexican delegations, meanwhile, were both led by
their respective foreign ministers. <br>
      <br>
During her speech at the opening session Mexican Foreign Minister,
Patricia Espinoza, said &#8220;a disagreement between Central American
[nations] that generates tension and polarizes political positions
harms [the entire region]. [This] border dispute between neighbouring
countries affects the progress of the Central American integration
process at the very moment, after half a century&#8217;s efforts, that the
process finds itself in a phase of concrete achievements and progress.&#8221;
      <br>
      <br>
Espinoza went on to describe the role of what is being referred to as
the &#8220;Mexican and Guatemalan facilitation exercise with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica&#8221; as being &#8220;to contribute to &#8230; an environment of respect and
harmony between [Nicaragua and Costa Rica] within which the ongoing
case at the International Court of Justice can be carried out.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
In a very real sense, the realization of the meeting on January 17th
was a diplomatic victory for the Ortega government given that,
previously, the Costa Rican government had insisted it would only
consider diplomatic dialogue with Nicaragua after Nicaraguan soldiers
were withdrawn from the border area in dispute. <br>
      <br>
The fact that the delegations representing either country did not
actually meet face to face in Cuernavaca but held separate, parallel
meetings with representatives of the facilitating governments
(Guatemala and Mexico), does not take away from the significance of the
meeting in terms of bringing closer the possibility of eventually
reaching a diplomatic solution to the dispute. <br>
      <br>
Indeed the joint statement signed by all four participating countries
read at the end of the meeting said the day had been characterized by
&#8220;broad, frank and friendly dialogue&#8221; between the parties in dispute and
the facilitating delegations. The joint statement went on to say both
the Nicaraguan and the Costa Rican delegations agree that this
mechanism of dialogue facilitated by Guatemala and Mexico is &#8220;a useful
and important mechanism.&#8221; Finally it was confirmed that all delegations
agreed to the continuation of the process of dialogue with the second
meeting planned to take place in Guatemala.<br>
      <br>
In trying to understand the scope and significance of the Costa Rican
government&#8217;s false territorial claims and the subsequent provocation of
the current dispute with Nicaragua, the concluding paragraphs of Prensa
Latina journalist Alfredo Pierat&#8217;s January 18th article &#8220;Who is
benefited by the conflict invented by Costa Rica over the River San
Juan?&#8221; are significant:<br>
      <br>
&#8220;[Costa Rica and Nicaragua] have a common history and enjoy bilateral
relations which, though not always straight forward, are characterized
by intense commercial and economic links.<br>
      <br>
&#8220;The conflict over the dredging of the River San Juan doesn&#8217;t just
affect every aspect of relations between the two nations, but also
takes its toll on the complex Central American Integration Process and
the unity of Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole. <br>
      <br>
Without doubt, [this conflict] does not benefit Nicaragua, nor does it
benefit Costa Rica or any other Latin American or Caribbean nation. It
does, however, benefit those who prefer to maintain the countries to
the South of the Rio Grande divided and in permanent conflict.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
Pierat&#8217;s suggestion that imperialist forces are behind the Costa Rican
government&#8217;s policy in this dispute &#8211; a dispute that does not favour
Costa Rican&#8217;s own economic or other interests &#8211; helps locate the
ongoing conflict within a wider regional context in which US allies in
the region engage in attempts to undermine and destabilize ALBA country
governments, often choosing critical moments in those countries&#8217;
electoral calendars to carry out such attempts.<br>
      <br>
The recent developments described in this article, however, appear to
play in Nicaragua&#8217;s favour not least because they represent a move away
from any perceived need for the dispute to be dealt with at the
pro-imperialist OAS. <br>
      <br>
At this stage, though, it is impossible to predict the outcome of
current efforts to ease tension between the two countries given that,
as yet, it is unclear how far the Costa Rican governments is willing to
defend and act on its spurious and irrational claim of a Nicaraguan
invasion. The Chinchilla government&#8217;s reaction to the ongoing legal
procedure at the World Court and the eventual ruling on the case will
be determining factors.&nbsp; <br>
