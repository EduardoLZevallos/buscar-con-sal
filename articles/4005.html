<h3><em>This is part II of Purpose Goes to Latin America. [</em> <a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2018/08/08/purpose-goes-to-latin-america/"><em>Part I</em></a>, <em>published August 8, 2018]</em></h3>

<p><strong>Foreword:</strong></p>

<p>In part one of our report <a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2018/08/08/purpose-goes-to-latin-america/">Purpose Goes to Latin America</a> ( August 8, 2018) we demonstrated how global powers orchestrate destabilization, war, economic and imperial domination via the facilitation of NGOs that comprise the non-profit industrial complex. Specifically, we looked at how this successful strategy is unveiling itself in Latin America. We explored “New Power” as a new instrument of hegemony, whereby New Power exponents when mobilized, can be successfully manipulated to serve neoliberal forces in ways never before achievable.</p>

<p>We disclosed the fact that Purpose (the for-profit PR arm of Avaaz) has set up in Latin America with campaigns and projects underway in Brazil and Colombia. This is not a coincidence. In the ongoing destabilization effort being waged against Venezuela, Colombia is being used as a base to launch further aggression. [August 9, 2018: <a href="https://libya360.wordpress.com/2018/08/23/farc-ep-colombia-can-not-lend-itself-to-a-foreign-intervention-against-venezuela/">Colombia Can Not Lend Itself to a Foreign Intervention against Venezuela</a>] Consider <strong>Purpose “movements” are not decrying the more than 300 assassinations of Colombian leaders over the last two years</strong> [<a href="http://en.granma.cu/mundo/2018-08-09/more-than-300-assassinations-of-colombian-leaders-over-the-last-two-years">Source</a>], rather they are organizing Concordia Summits to facilitate an advancing privatization in Colombia (and the world at large), as they court right wing politicians and oligarchs. This can best be described as “power in white face”.</p>

Our continent is a zone of peace and we must not allow ourselves to be deprived of that right.” — August 9, 2018: <a href="https://libya360.wordpress.com/2018/08/23/farc-ep-colombia-can-not-lend-itself-to-a-foreign-intervention-against-venezuela/">Colombia Can Not Lend Itself to a Foreign Intervention against Venezuela</a> <em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>

<p>This is where the lines between NGOs, internet and militarism begin to overlap and blur. In <a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2018/08/08/purpose-goes-to-latin-america/">part one</a> of this report, we discussed New Power at length as the new tool for expanding global hegemony. By the conclusion of this report, we will have explored the machinations of our new digital world, and how neoliberal and Imperial forces are using it to further colonization and drive economic growth – all under the guise of freedom, democracy and human rights. At this time, in the year 2018, we have come full circle to the inception of this blueprint, charted in 2007.</p>

<p>“This paper suggests that the rapid spread of information and communications technology (ICT) in the global south offers possibilities for democratic and social change unmatched since decolonization.” — <em>Prospects for e-Advocacy in the Global South – A Res Publica Report for the Gates Foundation, 2007</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2007, Res Publica completed a research and advisory project for the Gates Foundation titled <strong><em>Prospects for e-Advocacy in the Global South – A Res Publica Report for the Gates Foundation</em></strong><em>. </em>(From the report: <em>“</em>E-advocacy is the strategic use of ICT by individuals or movements to press for policy change.”) The Project Leader for the project was Res Publica and Avaaz co-founder Ricken Patel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Moreover, penetration of these technologies can revolutionize advocacy long before they reach substantial percentages of the population. <strong>The President of the Philippines was deposed in 2001 in an SMS-organized mobilization he called a “coup de text” when just 15% of Filipinos had mobile phones.</strong> — <em>Prospects for e-Advocacy in the Global South – A Res Publica Report for the Gates Foundation, 2007</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>However, there are formidable barriers to the realization of this opportunity.</strong> The digital divide is felt most acutely in sub-Saharan and South/Central Africa. While mobile phone penetration is growing rapidly even in this region, the promise of the internet and other ICTs is dimmed by regressive telecommunications policies and poor infrastructure. Across the global south, censorship and intimidation have shut off the internet as a source for social change <strong>in nations most in need of reform</strong>.” — <em>Prospects for e-Advocacy in the Global South – A Res Publica Report for the Gates Foundation, 2007</em></p>

<p>Katrin Verclas, Executive Director of Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network, was one of two expert advisors to the project.

<p>Excerpts from the Gates project report under the heading “The Cellular Savior”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The mobile phone is changing the way the global south communicates. Even as the number of landlines grows slowly, the growth of mobile phones is sky-rocketing, changing the connectivity potential for the planet…. What these figures indicate is that mobile phones are a great opportunity for e-advocates who want to reach a mass audience, and the applications are endless. [p. 18]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“… After the successful implementation of SMS [short message service/text messages] campaigns at the national level, the Gates Foundation might decide to fund an <strong>international SMS campaign*</strong>. Unlike the local SCO partners of the pilot programs, an international campaign would partner with international advocacy organizations with strong technology programs like Greenpeace, Oxfam, and the new international e-advocacy organization Avaaz.” [p. 41] [*Highlighted text in original document]</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The Gates Foundation has the unique ability to lead this new front of social change. The foundation’s distinctive experience in providing access to technology and challenging inequality in the global south, combined with resources that rival many nations, make it an ideal trailblazer in the global promotion of e-advocacy. We the researchers, writers, advisors, and reviewers of this report urge the Gates Foundation to take on this historic role. [p. 5]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we can pause for a moment to reflect. Avaaz, et al were not working toward a goal of ensuring every person on Earth would have access to clean drinking water. Rather, they were united in a global undertaking to ensure everyone on Earth would have access to a mobile phone. There is a quote attributed to Vladimir Lenin, in which variations are known to most in the Western world: “The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.” Perhaps in the 21st century we should update it to “The Capitalists will sell us the mobiles with which we will hang ourselves.”</p>

<p>There is little doubt that if society had chosen not to purchase cell phones, our corporate overlords and oligarchs would have put them in cereal boxes for free. But of course, we lined up and paid for our own enslavement, just as Aldous Huxley so aptly prophesied in 1931.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The goal of this funding strategy is to create a structure in which access to ICTs leads to a cyclical process of innovation and dissemination in e-advocacy which leads to social change. The final result of the implementation of ever improving e-advocacy methods is social change, achieved bit by bit through thousands of e-advocacy campaigns worldwide. E-advocacy is a powerful means for social change in the global south and the Gates Foundations has the unique ability to make that potential a reality.” — <em>Prospects for e-Advocacy in the Global South – A Res Publica Report for the Gates Foundation, 2007</em></p>

<h3><strong>The Igarapé Institute</strong></h3>

<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wrongkindofgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Igarape.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-14811 size-full" data-recalc-dims="1" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wrongkindofgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Igarape.jpg?resize=450%2C150" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/www.wrongkindofgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Igarape.jpg?w=450&#10;&#10;450w,&#10;http://i1.wp.com/www.wrongkindofgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Igarape.jpg?resize=300%2C100&#10;&#10;300w" /></a></p>

<p>The Igarapé Institute was formed in 2011 as a “think and do tank” in Brazil. The stated purpose of the institute is “raising attention to the challenges of violence and insecurity across Brazil and Latin America.” It works with international organizations such as the United Nations and the Inter-American Development Bank toward changes in government policy. The institute is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with staff in São Paulo, Brasília, Bogota and Mexico City.</p>

<p>Canadian Robert Muggah is the co-founder of the Igarapé Institute, SecDev Group, and SecDev Foundation.</p>

<p>The Igarapé Institute “supports a range of alliances, including with the CivCap group, UN, World Bank, World Economic Forum, World We Want and many others in civil society.” [<a href="https://igarape.org.br/en/about/global-networks/">Source</a>] Key partners include Crisis Action and a wealth of United Nation divisions. A “shortlist” of its <a href="https://igarape.org.br/en/about/partners/">key partners</a> that operate under the auspices of “peace and security” inclusive of <a href="https://crisisaction.org/">Crisis Action</a>, and the <a href="http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/">International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect</a> is extensive. <a href="https://igarape.org.br/en/about/supporters/">Funders</a> include Open Society Foundations, SecDev Foundation, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Virgin Unite. Honorary Igarapé <a href="https://igarape.org.br/en/about/team-and-boards/">board members</a> include Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former president of Brazil, and Cesar Gaviria, former president of Colombia, both having served as key early architects of neoliberal reform.</p>

<p>Notable is the fact that the <a href="https://www.ipinst.org/">International Peace Institute (IPI)</a> is cited as both a key partner and funder. Here we will divert, if only to once again demonstrate the nefarious interlocking directorate amongst the elite institutions which serve as the halls of power for empire and the advancement of colonial global domination. IPI is the discreet and upper level arm of the United Nations specializing in “multilateral approaches to peace and security issues”, working closely with the UN Secretariat and membership which has specific regional programs in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The IPI convenes “<a href="https://www.un.int/cotedivoire/fr/event/international-peace-institute-%E2%80%9Cc%C3%B4te-d%E2%80%99ivoire-successful-case-crisis-management-look-back-0">high-level panels</a>” that focus on international affairs and armed conflicts in the international peace and security genre.</p>

<p>The IPI Vienna Seminar on Peacemaking and Peacekeeping is an annual event, held in Vienna, Austria since 1970. Notable documents from the 39th seminar (June 14-16, 2009) are the foreword, and preface for the paper “The UN Security Council and the Responsibility to Protect: Policy, Process, and Practice”.</p>

<p>The modus operandi employed by “humanitarian NGOs” advocating for peace, security and “democracy”, falls somewhere between George Orwell’s euphemisms laid out in the 1949 publication <em>1984</em>. Today we bear witness as “war is peace” dovetails with the term <em>doublethink</em> (“the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.”) If we add in Jeremy Heiman’s New Power methods (see <a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2018/08/08/purpose-goes-to-latin-america/">part 1</a>), what we have is a world based more on fiction than reality. Aldous Huxley’s prophetic Brave New World written in 1931, almost pales in comparison to today’s blind servitude among the conditioned masses.</p>

<p>“Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.” —<em>George Orwell,</em> <em>1984, published 1949</em></p>

<p>The following excerpt is from the IPI website. Published August 10, 2018, following the western-led failed coup attempt against Nicaragua:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At the vanguard of Nicaragua’s uprising are the thousands of young protesters who have and continue to risk their lives. To them belongs the laurel for having exposed the path to dictatorship that, under a democratic veil, has been advancing in Nicaragua. The young protesters behind Nicaragua’s uprising do not belong to a political party, nor do they subscribe to any of the main political ideologies.”[<a href="https://theglobalobservatory.org/2018/08/nicaragua-uprising-from-dictatorship-to-revolution-to-dictatorship/">Source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to highlight the very end of that statement: “[N]or do they subscribe to any of the main political ideologies.” Finally, a semblance of truth. The targeted youth, the 21<sup>st</sup> century sacrificial lambs for empire, are being socially engineered by entities such as Purpose and CANVAS (discussed further in this section) to organize not only against their own best interests, but in the interests of the ruling elites and global corporatocracy to which they will be further subjugated.</p>

<p>The following observation is of critical importance. From the book <a href="https://www.idrc.ca/sites/default/files/openebooks/578-6/index.html"><em>Enabling Openness: The Future of the Information Society in Latin America and the Caribbean</em></a> by<strong> </strong>International Development Research Centre, Canada, it is observed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Through the research conducted by Instituto Igarapé we have analysed many examples that reflect a significant move towards this new form of policy making. Through <strong>the Open Empowerment Initiative (OEI) –a joint research project with the SecDev Foundation of Canada, aimed at understanding the effects of “cyber empowerment” on the reconfiguration of the social, political and economic spheres in Latin America</strong>– we have observed an ever bigger role played by the democratising potential of new technologies. These have allowed civil society actors to make their voices heard and to become involved in areas of public interest that were once the exclusive domain of the state, such as public security….</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These types of websites include: change.org, gopetition.com, petition24.com and peticiones24.com, thepetitionsite.com, signon.org, elquintopoder.cl, avaaz.org, sumofus.org, causes.com, getup.org.au and twitition.com.” [<em>Section 3, Smart data, digital inclusion and interactive democracy: Reflections on the use of ICTs to enhance citizen security in Latin America by</em> <em>Gustavo </em><em>Macedo Diniz][Emphasis added]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of interest and perhaps unknown to the author is that the bulk of these “social change” websites have been created by the same and select group of individuals that inhabit elite circles. Audience and spheres of influence are of paramount importance here since it is the foundation of whose interests is ultimately at stake. With this in mind, we can note that many of the websites are exclusively written in the English language (as opposed to Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, etc.) Yet this doesn’t appear to be a barrier to the desired changes sought by the think tanks. Ultimately, this begs the question of who the target audience truly is. However, this is changing as international NGOs now shift their focus to developing countries to spread their message among the indigenous youth residing in critical hot spots in the Global South, which mirrors the online “clitcktivism” rampant in the Western world and its indoctrinated youth.</p>

<p>To further explore this line of questioning, we can delve into the Operations Newsletter compiled by <a href="mailto:Jeff.Harley@SMDC-CS.army.mil?subject=ARSTRAT%20IO%20Newsletter">Mr. Jeff Harley</a> US Army Space and Missile Defense Command Army Forces Strategic Command G39, Information Operations Division. [Vol. 12, no. 04, February 2012] The compilation includes <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/technology-news/2012/02/us-could-maintain-virtual-presence-in-syria/50586/">an article</a> describing the <a href="http://blogs.state.gov/index.php/site/entry/virtual_embassy_tehran/">December launch</a> (2012) of the State Department’s <a href="http://iran.usembassy.gov/">“virtual embassy”</a> for Tehran, essentially a standard U.S. embassy website without a physical embassy standing behind it – which could be duplicated for Syria and any other potential geopolitical targets in the future. Also highlighted is Muggah’s SecDev in Syria:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s difficult to measure how much effect sites like the virtual embassy have, Anderson said, but ideally they can present a clearer vision of U.S. society, culture and policy than what’s portrayed in Iranian state media.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s basically the hearts and minds things,” he said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Damascus embassy’s website could easily be transitioned into something like the Tehran website, Anderson said, but would be stymied by a lower level of tech savvy in Syria.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>About <a href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/syria">20 percent</a> of Syrians are online compared with about <a href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/iran">30 percent</a> of Iranians, according to the <strong>OpenNet Initiative, a joint project by Harvard, the University of Toronto and the SecDev Group, a Canadian security and development company</strong>. Syrian Internet is significantly less developed and more regulated, though, according to ONI.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A more important diplomatic tool than maintaining the website, Anderson said, will be maintaining a U.S. presence in social media. Ambassador Ford’s Facebook chats, for instance, could be done just as easily from Washington as from Damascus and would reach a wider audience.” <em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>

<p>On March 12 , 2018 a lecture titled <a href="https://larc.ucalgary.ca/event/2018-03-12/cancelled-rise-citizen-security-americas"><em>The Rise of Citizen Security in the Americas</em></a> by Robert Muggah was to be presented by the University of Calgary Latin America Research Centre (later cancelled). In the event description along with Muhggah’s extensive background, it reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Latin American and Caribbean societies are among the most violent on earth. With some exceptions, the problem appears to be worsening. Why? There is not one, but several explanations that account for the steady increase in violent crime across the region. In addition to widespread impunity and jarring inequality, a major part of the problem is connected to repressive and punitive approaches to tackling criminality.” <em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a glaring representation of the obvious modern paternalistic aspects of the relationship between North America and South America. Latin American and Caribbean societies are not among the most violent on earth. Rather, they are among the most exploited. Exploited by the hands that feed the non-profit industrial complex and institutions that hide the cold hard fact that US imperialism and the capitalist economic system are both founded and dependent on violence.</p>

<p>In January 25, 2018, the French philosopher and author, Dr. Lucien Cerise observed the blurred lines between digital “phishing” and behavioural change achieved via social engineering in the paper <a href="https://www.transnotitia.com/the-social-engineering-of-identitarian-conflict/">The Social Engineering of Identitarian Conflict</a><strong>: </strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“According to the famous computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, social engineering is the art of deception; it is essentially about playing on the credulity of others to modify their behavior, which is also what “phishing” is all about. The fact that the apex is perceived with trust or indifference allows it to be seen, but not as the architect of conflict. It is a matter of “hiding in plain sight”, a “royal art” and technique used by prestidigitators, illusionists, esoteric societies, and secret services.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what think tanks in collaboration with NGOs, global institutions and media are now being able to achieve with increasing precision. It is doubtful that such engineering, global in scale, could be achieved outside the digital age.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2018/08/08/purpose-goes-to-latin-america/">Dixon of Purpose</a>, Muggah created a Syrian based anti-Assad #<a href="https://www.secdev-foundation.org/what-we-do/digital-safety-opportunity-and-citizenship/amennysyria/">AmennySyria</a> through The SalamaTech project, an initiative of The SecDev Foundation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The 8-week campaign was launched on July 1, 2014 by <a href="https://www.secdev-foundation.org/cause/salamatech/">SalamaTech</a> in conjunction with several partner organisations.</p>

<p>The campaign has already reached more than 480,000 people on Facebook alone.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Digital safety matters in Syria. Syrian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen">netizens</a> are being captured, tortured and killed because of their online activities. This threat comes not just from the Assad regime. Armed groups like Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are also capturing and torturing people to access their online accounts. When a Syrian human rights defender (HRD) is captured, his or her entire network including friends and family, are exposed.”</p>

<p>As the American left is besieged with the most intense Facebook censorship crackdown to date, consider the opposite set of rules for SalamaTech in the August 2014 <a href="https://www.secdev-foundation.org/a-kingdom-of-silence-no-more-facebook-the-syrian-revolution/">“Special Report, A ‘Kingdom of Silence No More’: Facebook &amp; the Syrian Revoltion”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Facebook has redefined community in Syria, both online and off. <strong>The communities that have emerged through social media provide a glimpse of what a post-Assad Syria might look like: diverse, divided and chaotic; but also empowered and connected</strong> – connected like never before, including across the sectarian and geographic barriers being increasingly erected by the war.”<em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Diverse, divided and chaotic; but also empowered and connected”… like Libya? From the most prosperous nation in Africa to an absolute failed state? It’s nothing less than tragic that the NATO-led invasion of Libya did not teach the West a thing about Western-backed regime change under the guise of “humanitarian intervention”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“From the earliest days of the revolution, <strong>Facebook and YouTube served as indispensable platforms for Syrian non-violent activists to call for change and to organize.</strong> As Dlshad Othman states: “The internet has been central to the revolution in Syria. It brought us together. It taught us about our rights. It gave us freedom.”<em> [p. 2]</em><em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is not only wise to ask the question as to who Dlshad Othman really is, in this modern day of NGO warfare, doing so is imperative. In 2012, Dlshad was chosen an <a href="http://2007-2017-blogs.state.gov/stories/2012/06/25/internet-freedom-fellows-program-emphasizes-defense-fundamental-freedoms-online.html">Internet Freedom Fellow</a> (one of six), a program funded by the <a href="http://2007-2017-blogs.state.gov/stories/2012/06/25/internet-freedom-fellows-program-emphasizes-defense-fundamental-freedoms-online.html">U.S. State Department</a>. Of interest is the fact that another chosen Internet Freedom Fellow, Andres Azpurua of Venezuela, was a <a href="https://rightscon2018.sched.com/speaker/andres_azpurua.1y3l0332">RightsCon (Access Now) speaker</a> in May of 2018 (“<a href="https://rightscon2018.sched.com/event/EHmy/information-controls-in-latin-america-censorship-in-different-layers-and-nuances">Information Controls in Latin America: Censorship in Different Layers and Nuances</a>“)(information on RightsCon/Access Now follows.)</p>

<p>As the Syrian Army (and her people) continues to defeat the seven-year long destabilization effort carried out by the most powerful military forces on Earth, <a href="https://thesyriacampaign.org/">The Syria Campaign</a> (Purpose) saw fit to launch a new initiative (May 17, 2018) with a new branding strategy: <a href="https://idliblives.org/">Idlib Lives: The Untold Story of Heroes</a>.

<p>May 26, 2018, The Guardian: <em>Amid Syria’s horror, a new force emerges: the women of Idlib</em><em>:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Assad’s position was boosted last week when he finally achieved control of all areas around Damascus. The almost daily aerial bombardment of Idlib by Syrian and Russian forces is expected to be stepped up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39500947">regime has repeatedly used chemical weapons in Idlib</a>.

<p>On <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/events/upcoming-events/detail/fighting-isis-and-alqaeda-through-syrian-civil-society">November 6, 2015</a>, Fares made an appearance at The Atlantic Council (a Washington think tank), where he was introduced by Ambassador Frederic Hof – former special advisor for transition in Syria to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <em>at the U.S. Department of State.</em> [<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/syria-civil-war-213242">Source</a>] A week prior to the Atlantic Council appearance, Fares met with US Congressman Ed Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee.</p>

<p>Fares was a 2017 <a href="https://oslofreedomforum.com/talks/building-a-free-syria-one-town-at-a-time-1">speaker</a> for the Oslo Speaker Forum as was <a href="https://oslofreedomforum.com/events/oslo-freedom-forum-in-new-york">Srdja Popovic </a>(CANVAS, Harvard, Otpor).

<p>In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/magazine/radio-free-syria.html">Dec 4, 2014</a> New York Time article <em>Radio-free Syria</em>, the reporter describes her interview with Fares in the back seat of an automobile with incredible candor, disclosing Fares dalliances with those directly aligned with the U.S. State Department:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The two Americans in the front seat laughed. One, a 57-year-old named Jim Hake, is the founder and chief executive of Spirit of America, a nongovernmental organization with the explicit mission to support U.S. military and diplomatic efforts… The driver, Isaac Eagan, 33, is a U.S. Army veteran who works for Hake. Earlier that week, Fares had slipped over the Turkish-Syrian border to meet Hake and Eagan and collect 500 solar-powered and hand-crank radios that Spirit of America, working with the State Department, was giving to his radio station, Radio Fresh.”</p>

The RightsConocation conference took place in Asia (Manila) which is detailed in the following excerpt: “Hosted by <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/">Access Now</a>, RightsCon is where the world’s business leaders, technologists, engineers, investors, activists, human rights experts, and government representatives come together to build partnerships, shape global norms, showcase new technologies, and confront the most challenging issues at the intersection of human rights and technology. More than an event, RightsCon is a global community with thousands of leading voices across stakeholder lines.” [<a href="https://www.rightscon.org/about/">Source</a>]</p>

<p>Avaaz and the SecDev Foundation were key participants in a <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/rightscon-southeast-asia-tech-companies-civil-society-government-to-discuss-open-internet/">massive cast</a> of those that today shape the world – and infiltrate our “hearts and minds”.</p>

<p>According to Avaaz’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/profile/brett-solomon/">Brett Solomon</a>, Executive Director of Access who hosted the event:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The conference is taking place at a time when governments, companies, technologists, and human rights activists are dealing with a range of pressing issues in the Southeast Asia region. From Singapore to Malaysia, Myanmar to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia’s 600 million people are coming online rapidly, and its businesses and consumers are making innovative use of technologies to develop their economies and to expand activities online. This explosive growth has huge ramifications for human rights.”[<a href="https://www.accessnow.org/rightscon-southeast-asia-tech-companies-civil-society-government-to-discuss-open-internet/">Source</a>]</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/program/">2018 RightsCon event</a> took place in Toronto, Canada with a <a href="https://rightscon2018.sched.com/directory/speakers">speaker list</a> so extensive, it is six pages long.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Born out of the aftermath of the 2009 Iranian election, Access uses cutting edge technologies to help people living behind the firewall, provides thought leadership on the new frontier of digital rights and mobilizes a global citizens’ movement of 300,000 people in over 100 countries.” — <a href="http://www.cyberdialogue.ca/previous-dialogues/2012-about/participants/"><em>Cyber Dialogue 2012 participant webpage</em></a></p>

<p>The Open Empowerment Initiative (OEI) is a partnership between Muggah’s SecDev Foundation (Canada) and the <a href="http://igarape.org.br/">Igarapé Institute</a> (Brazil), which not coincidentally was also co-founded by Muggah. Its said mission is to “investigate how cyberspace is shaping citizen action and state-society relations in LatinAmerica. The third partner in this modern day NGO “axis of evil” is the <a href="http://openempowerment.org/idrc.ca">International Development Research Centre (IDRC)</a>, a Canadian Crown corporation established by an act of Parliament in 1970 to help developing countries find solutions to their problems. Most of IDRC’s funding comes from annual appropriations from Canada’s Parliament. IDRC also receives funds from other sources, such as foundations and other Canadian and international organizations.

<p>“The past twenty years have seen the greatest expansion of information in the history of humanity. We now create more information in two days than we did from the dawn of civilization. Two-thirds of humanity are now connected to the internet. There are more cell phones than people on the planet. Computing power doubles every 18 months. The cost of communication continues to fall.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>We live in revolutionary times…</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Institutions are under stress as digital natives — those born into a 24×7 online world — flex their political muscles. Empowerment in the wired world is not constrained by borders or convention.

<p>As we have barely scratched the surface upon the matrix of allied NGOs, cyber firms, military institutions, think tanks, institutions, states and media, working in tandem to remake the world in the image of the West, the following excerpt from the paper <a href="http://www.strandconsult.dk/sw7153.asp"><em>The Moment of Truth – A Portrait of the Fight For Hard Net Neutrality Regulation by Save the Internet and Other Internet Activists</em></a> by <a href="http://www.strandconsult.dk/">Strand Consult</a>, July 2016, sheds much needed light on the barren, manufactured “movements” of the 21<sup>st</sup> century:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Activist causes could not be achieved without a significant investment in digital tools and technologies. This includes a database of users and associated marketing and communications technologies to engage the user bases. Activists organizations and political parties have been honing these tools over the last decade with regard to net neutrality. A 2006 article describes net neutrality as “the brainchild of the likes of Google and Amazon.com, which want to offer consumers things like high-speed movie downloads, but don’t want to pay the network operators a fee to ensure what in the industry is called “quality of service”– i.e. , ensuring the consumer gets what he pays for quickly and reliably.” <strong>The article describes the founding of a “Data Warehouse” by Hillary Clinton political adviser Harold Ickes, a fundraising list service and data mining operation. The $11.5 million investment was supported primarily by Soros, Google and Amazon. Former Democratic National Committee Director of Engineering Nick Gaw explains in a video how the data warehousing function runs on Amazon Web Services to enable Democratic party members to be elected at local and national level and to mine the information of its voters. Gaw is now the Senior Technology Advisor for Avaaz.org</strong>, an online platform to conduct online activist campaigns including European campaigns against Brexit, Donald Trump, and Monsanto’s Glyphosate. The website notes some 44 million members. Avaaz was founded by Brett Solomon [3], now Executive Director of Access, a net neutrality advocacy…</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With well-funded, globally coordinated, digitally sophisticated campaigns, SavetheInternet and related Internet activists have succeeded to deliver hard net neutrality regulations in some 50 countries. <strong>Internet activism is an industry; “digital prostitutes” who will lend their support to corporate-inspired causes are available for hire; and net neutrality activism has received hundreds of millions of dollars of support from corporate and foundation funders intent on protecting their financial portfolios and business models. US-based net neutrality activists franchise and broker their activism models and concepts to a variety of activist entrepreneurs around the world</strong>.” <em>[Emphasis added] </em></p>

<h3><strong>Responsibility to Protect </strong></h3>

<p>From 2008 to 2015, More In Common (a Purpose project) co-founder Gemma Mortensen served as executive director of Crisis Action. The Deputy Executive Director for Crisis Action, Nicola Reindorp has contributed extensively to the Responsibility to Protect doctrine: “There, she led Oxfam’s global campaigning on conflict and humanitarian crises, working alongside allies in government and civil society to achieve the historic agreement by world leaders that they have a responsibility to protect populations from genocide and crimes against humanity, at the 2005 UN World Summit. From Oxfam, Nicola moved to set up the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect.” Prior to this, Reindorp was an advisor for Avaaz.

<p>Prior to founding Avaaz, all co-founders of this organization share a <a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/fundamental">vital</a> common They all share a background working in one capacity or another for the United Nations. Over the decades they have only strengthened and utilized this relationship to serve the elite classes and empire as a whole. A prime example of this relationship is Avaaz co-founder Tom Perriello, who worked as a legal adviser to the UN and related bodies in Sierra Leone, Darfur and Afghanistan and later became a US congressman helped into power by former US president Barack Obama. Another person of prominence is Avaaz co-founder Andrea Woodhouse, who formerly worked for both United Nations and the World Bank (where she continues today).</p>

<p>The following excerpt is from the journal article, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41963094">Power of the iMob</a> authored by Andrew Marshall, a media consultant and former journalist who worked for Avaaz as a paid consultant in 2009.[Source: The World Today, Vol. 68, No. 3, April &amp; May 2012 published by the Royal Institute of International Affairs]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Avaaz, ultimately the largest and most global of the dot-orgs, also came out of MoveOn and its alumni. Individual co-founders included Ricken Patel (Avaaz’s Canadian executive director); Tom Pravda, a former British diplomat; Tom Perriello, who had worked as a legal adviser to the UN and related bodies in Sierra Leone, Darfur and Afghanistan and later became a US congressman; Pariser, formerly of MoveOn; Andrea Woodhouse, formerly of the United Nations and the World Bank; and Australians Madden and Heimans. 38Degrees, the next in the family, was launched in May 2009 as a British parallel to GetUp! Founders included Ben Brandzel, formerly of MoveOn; Gemma Mortensen of Crisis Action; Paul Hilder, also of Avaaz; and Benedict Southworth of the World Development Movement. Most of these people had worked with government or international organisations abroad. Madden had served as an army officer, and worked for the World Bank in East Timor and the UN in Indonesia. Heimans had worked for McKinsey. Others had been with NGOs. Patel, for example, had been with International Crisis Group in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan and Afghanistan. Several had been at elite academic institutions…</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The dot-orgs are also growing up and moving beyond an online-only presence: indeed they would say that online was never the point. In Syria, Avaaz provided cameras and satellite communication gear to help the opposition to get its story out. This isn’t coincidence. Patel’s movement may for many people symbolise technology and geekdom, but Patel is much more interested in what technology can actually achieve. The organisation has for some years experimented with the use of new technologies to help activists communicate, broadcast, witness and report atrocities and bring in intervention” [<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/theatre_s/current/postgraduate/ma-theatre-performance-research-2017/option_modules/th988/schedule/marshall.pdf">Source</a>]</p>

<p>This is most revelatory since this sentiment is not expressed by an outsider, but someone who has been immersed in the Non-Profit Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>The background into both Avaaz and Purpose has been documented extensively. Further reading of the 2012 investigative series is required reading for legitimate activists and movements in the global south.</p>

<p><em>Harvard’s Pied Piper: On Friday, April 13, Srdja Popovic officially became the 53rd Rector of the Scotland’s first university. (via St Andrews).</em></p>

<p>Part 4 of the <a href="http://www.theartofannihilation.com/avaaz-the-globes-largest-most-powerful-behavioural-change-network-part-i/">2017 investigative series on Avaaz</a> analyses the role of Harvard University in global destabilization campaigns via the churching out of “activists”, “thought-leaders”, think tanks and doctrines at large. Of particular interest is Srdja Popovic, co<strong>–</strong>founder of Otpor, now rebranded as <a href="http://canvasopedia.org">Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies</a> (CANVAS) and his position at Harvard Kennedy School as Lead Instructor for the Harvard “executive education” program, <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/educational-programs/executive-education/leading-nonviolent-movements-social-progress">Leading Nonviolent Movements for Social Progress</a><em>. </em>Popovic leads the course with Otpor co-founder <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/slobodan-djinovic">Slobodan Djinovic</a>.</p>

<p>Djinovic established one of the first internet companies in Serbia (MediaWorks) which since merged with two other providers to form <a href="https://www.ekapija.com/en/people/486809/slobodan-djinovic-ceo-of-orion-telekom-we-will-acquire-several-companies-in">Orion Telekom</a> where Djinovic serves as the CEO. [<a href="http://canvasopedia.org/about-us/">Source</a>] Djinovic is a counselor of the World Bank and a co-founder of the <a href="https://icthubventure.com/">ICT Hub</a> (information and communications technology, closed in 2008). According to the Financial Times: “Djinovic is a good-looking former basketball player with an MA in international relations from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in the US, and has a self-possessed, confident air. He founded Serbia’s first wireless internet provider and could be a Silicon Valley mogul if he wanted to, but instead he gives half of what he earns to keep Canvas afloat. (The other half comes from various NGOs and the UN.)”</p>

<p>OTPOR! Is the organization credited with the overthrow of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 and has since played a leading and pivotal role in Western backed “<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia-and-%E2%80%9Ccolor-revolution%E2%80%9D">coloured revolutions</a>“.</p>

<p><em>Srdja Popovic twitter account</em></p>

<p>Commencing in 2018, states featured in the CANVAS spotlight include Cuba, Bolivia and Nicaragua (which has received highlighted weekly coverage since April 20, 2018). As this article is focused on the influx of NGOs in Latin America to meet Imperial objectives, it is critical to note that Cuba, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela represent the primary targets for destabilization in Latin America at this time. [See the CANVAS analysis on <a href="http://canvasopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bolivia-country-analysis.pdf">Bolivia</a>, <a href="http://canvasopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/brazilian-protests-analysis.pdf">Brazil</a> and <a href="http://canvasopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/venezuela-for-WEB-2016.pdf">Venezuela</a>.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“On the level of a bottom-up approach, opposition leaders like María Corina Machado have advocated for popular protest and resistance as the best way to topple the Maduro government. This would require more than just street protests and would need to be an all-encompassing effort from all sectors of society.” — <em>p. 35, CANVAS, Analysis on situation in Venezuela, August 2016</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>CANVAS states that regarding the Venezuela “uprising”, “the student movement was the primary group involved in the 2014 anti-government protests”. CANVAS acknowledges the protests contained “virtually no representation of the majority class in Venezuela”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“However, although the opposition has used grassroots campaigning to gain the support of the poor in the past, they seem to be losing their sense of what the poor majority wants. <strong>This was evidenced most visibly in the 2014 protests, where the largely student-based middle class population marched, with virtually no representation of the majority class in Venezuela, the poor.</strong> This was because the opposition has chosen to advocate for changes unfamiliar and of less concern to the poor than more pressing issues like supply shortages, unemployment and rampant violent crime. However, the structure of the opposition and methodology is well developed, and would be instrumental in disrupting the regime, especially if they were to realign their goals with the poor in mind.” — p. 34, CANVAS, Analysis on situation in Venezuela, August 2016 <em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>CANVAS is incorrect in its conclusions that the absence of the majority “was because the opposition has chosen to advocate for changes unfamiliar and of less concern to the poor than more pressing issues like supply shortages, unemployment and rampant violent crime.” The truth is that the Venezuelan majority, under attack for decades by the West, has developed a deep understanding of colonialism, imperialism and Western interventionism. A knowledge lost on most all Western society. The “pressing issues like supply shortages, unemployment and rampant violent crime” are recognized across Venezuelan society as the direct and deliberate destabilization efforts orchestrated by foreign interests.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the Venezuelan youth targeted by CANVAS are those belonging to the middle/upper classes, who, indoctrinated by the false illusion of the American Dream, have a deep desire to be assimilated into the Western culture. The truth is that the majority of Venezuelans support the Maduro government, demonstrating remarkable, strength, courage and endurance to the relentless destabilization efforts orchestrated by the west, that continue to this day.</p>

<p>Regarding Bolivia, CANVAS appears even more desperate. The CANVAS analysis on Bolivia utilizes reports from Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, US Department of State and Amnesty international (all instruments of empire), to present its misleading arguments. As an example, the report states “…racism is rife in the country according to Freedom House, especially against indigenous groups” and yet in reality, almost the entire population in Bolivia is indigenous, including President Evo Morales himself.</p>

<p>Incredibly CANVAS tries to diminish this fact and frame it as a psyop against the Bolivian people, by lauding Andrés de Santa Cruz as the first true Indigenous president of Bolivia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The protest movement then also paved the way for Evo Morales’ Presidency. After losing his first Presidential race against De Lozado in 2001, Morales was elected President of Bolivia in late 2005, “on a wave of a popular and indigenous rebellion against neoliberal privatizations and for popular (Bolivian and indigenous) sovereignty”. He thus became what the country believed to be its first head of state of indigenous origin. This idea is, however, part of the very well managed propaganda created by the government around Morales’ image. He was not the first indigenous president of Bolivia; that title belongs to former president Andrés de Santa Cruz Calahumana. The political propaganda created to legitimize Morales’ image has taken advantage of Bolivia’s poor education system to repeat this lie enough times that it has become an accepted fact by the general public, and the few historians that have dared to challenge this idea have been silenced by state media.” — <em>CANVAS, </em><a href="http://canvasopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bolivia-country-analysis.pdf"><em>Bolivia, Country Anylsis</em></a><em>, p 3</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Santa Cruz, the president of Bolivia from 1829 – 1839, was born into a family of the colonial nobility. His Spaniard father, José Santa Cruz y Villavicencio, married Juana Basilia Calahumana, a heiress of a rich mestiza family said to be a descendant of the Incas. At the time of birth, Andres de Santa Cruz was classified in his baptismal certificate as Spanish, a term used in the colonies to refer to the white race. This is not to say that Santa Cruz did not play an integral part for Bolivia’s independence. It is only to say that the fact CANVAS highlights this historical background, which is a historical inaccuracy at best and a lie at worst, is a simple imperialist tactic to marginalize Morales’ achievements (not to mention the deliberate negating of ethnicity and class divisions).</p>

<p>Morales “image” as CANVAS calls it, is simply a reflection of the man with most humble origins. Born to an Aymara family of subsistence farmers, Morales was raised in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton. One of seven children, only he and two siblings, survived past childhood. [Source: The Extraordinary Rise of the First Indigenous President of Bolivia]</p>

<p>On January 10, 2018, CANVAS published the article Crumbling Democracy and Protest Movements in Evo Morales’ Bolivia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the last week of 2017, CANVAS wrote about the rising tension in Honduras, after the November 2017 elections turned into a true stand-off. A little further south, in Bolivia, citizens also face an increasingly authoritarian government. As President Evo Morales tries to sideline the country’s constitution to assure himself of another term in office, Bolivian citizens are rising up to restore democracy in their Andean country, using nonviolence as one of their main weapons…</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally, the nature of the protest-movement opposing the Morales-administration has also fundamentally changed. In the past, movements have backed particular individuals and their battle to facilitate Morales’ fall from the throne. But the Bolivian population has turned its eyes to <strong>younger generations looking for new leaders, with new developments mainly concentrated in the city of Santa Cruz</strong>. Currently, citizen platforms are organizing themselves in a singular, horizontal group of socially coordinated movements, which seek to “empower not any one individual but the message of struggle for democracy itself,” according to Vaca Daza.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>In line with this new strategic direction, over 15 platforms and independent activists united themselves with a manifesto on December 29<sup>th</sup>.</strong> A broad coalition of student unions, female civic resistance groups, health workers, environmental groups and democracy activists pledged to build on the active and interventionist tactics of nonviolent resistance to “<strong>resist the tyranny</strong>” and called on fellow citizens to join them in making their voice heard. <strong>CANVAS will be following the developments in Bolivia closely!”</strong><em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that CANVAS inadvertently points to the new hub of “activism” as being “mainly concentrated in the city of Santa Cruz.” CANVAS omits the fact that 1) Santa Cruz, has long been known as home to the powerful economic elite, right-wing political organizations, and 2) the racism Otpor utilizes for its own unjust cause, stems from the “light-skinned” Santa Cruz populace: “Racism is not admissible in the world in the 21st century, but it must be known that it is being promoted in Bolivia by sectors of the population which are economically powerful. These groups, today settled in the region of Santa Cruz, many of them offspring of immigrants from Europe, Asia and the Middle East have appropriated the indigenous identity of Santa Cruz, known as “camba” and this is being used to show racial supremacy over the “colla” and “chapaco” (indigenous people of the West and South of Bolivia)… This discourse, which is being used to paint both the President and the process of political change as a force for ill, has created an atmosphere which is intended to breed conditions for social and racial violence towards Bolivia’s indigenous and working classes.” [<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/south-america/2008/06/bolivia-violence-indigenous">Source</a>]</p>

<p>This type of tactic is what we have previously witnessed in various regions when it comes to Western NGOs and media forces. They exploit existing societal fractures in order to provoke violent conflict for various political and economic gains. Where fractures don’t exist, they are created. If ever there is evidence of what it looks like – to seize and utilize existing hate, racism and divisions within the confines of a state – for geopolitical gain, a key methodology that CANVAS is exploiting to its fullest, one needs to look no further than the 2014 coup in Ukraine: “Ukraine on Fire by Igor Lopatonok (Executive producer Oliver Stone) provides a historical perspective for the deep divisions in the region which led to the 2004 Orange Revolution, 2014 uprisings, and the violent overthrow of democratically elected Yanukovych. Covered by Western media as a people’s revolution, it was in fact a coup d’état scripted and staged by nationalist groups and the U.S. State Department. Investigative journalist Robert Parry reveals how U.S.-funded political NGOs and media companies have emerged since the 80s replacing the CIA in promoting America’s geopolitical agenda abroad.”</p>

<p>In 2014 CANVAS was listed as a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates: “Reasons for the inclusion of Serbian non-profit CANVAS is widely understood around the region. Last December, the Kuwaiti National Security Agency released a social media video explaining the role of CANVAS in promoting dissent in the state. Furthermore, security agencies in the region are closely monitoring members and affiliates of the group, however no official stance has been taken until now.” [<a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/mideast-africa/2014/11/20/questions-praise-for-uaes-terrorist-list/">Source</a>]</p>

<p>Yet, as old as Otpor may be, rebranded and repackaged under the sophisticated pretext of academia, CANVAS is just getting started. CANVAS has launched <a href="http://www.buildamovement.org/what-we-do/">BUILD A MOVEMENT</a> (BAM):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“(BAM) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to researching and spreading knowledge on the methods of nonviolent, grassroots activism to promote democracy, human rights and social change.</p>

<p>On the ground with activists, on university campuses, with policy-makers or in the media, Build A Movement aims to strengthen the capacity of people-power movements and civil society around the world, not only to challenge authoritarianism and injustice, but to ensure durable transitions to democracy…</p>

<p>Over the past decade, BAM staff and trainers have worked in dozens of countries, including Venezuela, Syria, Ukraine, Cambodia, Burma, Zimbabwe, and Egypt, and trained thousands of activists fighting for democracy, transparency, accountability, human rights, women’s rights, LGBT rights, environmental protection, racial justice and social justice. BAM instructors have also taught courses at U.S. universities such as the Harvard Kennedy School and New York University.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Beyond training, BAM supports front line activists by developing educational material on movement building and technological tools to evade surveillance, censorship and harassment.” [<a href="http://www.buildamovement.org/what-we-do/">Source</a>]</p>

<p>When a Western society collectively celebrates an African leader beloved by his people (including Nelson Mandela)being sodomized and murdered, only to then mourn the death of a war criminal, the society is not only grounded in ignorance, it is collectively, ethically and morally bankrupt. All the so-called “higher education” in the world will not make this fact any less so. Our so called “environmental NGOs” purport to “fight for the climate” and “save the bees” all while playing key roles in the annihilation of whole countries, complete with all the biology and life they formerly encompassed. Simultaneously “human rights NGOs”, sitting at the table with the world’s most imperial institutions, create the acquiescence needed to bomb countries to smithereens, inclusive of the women and children that live in them, while Yemenis, Palestinians, Congolese and Haitians are ignored with not a trace of outcry to be found. The fact that Purpose and The Rules co-founder Tim Dixon, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/tim-dixon">enjoys reading Ronald Reagan biographies in his spare time</a>, yet is upheld as a radical leader of social movements, reveals more about the left and it’s “movements” than can ever be articulated in this report. Welcome to the 21<sup>st</sup> century non-profit industrial spectacle.</p>

<p>Popovic states there is no way to control the “new media” (another take on New Power). What this really means, is that the non-submissive governments targeted for destabilization have no way of controlling what Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega described this past month in the <a href="https://libya360.wordpress.com/2018/08/09/nicaraguas-failed-coup/">failed coup attempt</a> as an “embryo of a force”. CANVAS et al instigate the momentum, then capture it, effectively orchestrating the uprisings out of both mind and sight. The momentum of the people, manipulated by the elite forces, become the agents of their own cataclysmic decent into the neoliberal noose of imperial servitude.</p>

<p>In 2013 Google Ideas hosted the “Conflict in a Connected World Roundtable Series”, in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations’ Center of Preventative Action. One can see from the summary report that the main focus of the series is the role of social media in destabilization campaigns:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Regardless of any changes to future sanctions regimes, the importance of social media in the conflict is already enormous. In particular, the Syrian civil war has been understood by foreigners almost exclusively through the lens of social media. With limited ability for journalists to enter the country, the world has watched the evolution of the conflict on sites like Facebook and YouTube, where literally hundreds of thousands of amateur videos have been uploaded since the war began.” [<a href="http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/Conflict_in_a_Connected_World_Series_Summary_7-2-13.pdf">Source</a>]</p>

<p>“USAID, Humanity United and OpenIDEO have partnered to pursue ways to prevent mass atrocities – that is, deliberate mass violence against civilians.” — <a href="https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/usaid-humanity-united/brief"><em>The challenge</em></a><em>, OpenIDEO website</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenIDEO informs that “[t]oday, <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/0,,contentMDK:23252415%7EpagePK:478093%7EpiPK:477627%7EtheSitePK:477624,00.html">1.5 billion</a> people are living in countries affected by violent conflict. And since 1945, <a href="http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/pab/BellamyPAB22011.pdf">67%</a> of mass atrocities have occurred within the context of armed conflict, which makes these areas difficult to access.” What it omits is the fact that almost all large scale violence to humans on this Earth is caused by imperialism, colonialism and the capitalist industrial economy. Foreign interference ensures all three are kept alive and thriving.</p>

<p>Answering this challenge, apparently <a href="https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/usaid-humanity-united/inspiration/avaaz/">inspired by Avaaz</a>, is People’s Intelligence.</p>

<p>In September 2013, with the authorization of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, the non-profit foundation Stichting People’s Intelligence was established to develop and implement the <a href="http://peoples-intelligence.org/">People’s Intelligence</a> mobile application. The application “automates the collection of relevant human rights and humanitarian information from hard to access areas using crowdsourcing and “dumb” mobile phones.”</p>

<p>The application is in its <a href="http://peoples-intelligence.org/storyboard/">demo stage</a> and can be found <a href="http://peoples-intelligence.org/pi-demo/">here</a>.</p>

<p>“We welcome your hard earned currencies as well as your time and skills.

<p>The founder of People’s Intelligence is Christophe Billen who began his career as an intern for the UN in Haiti during the crisis which removed Aristide from power in 2004. Billen has a lengthy background in security having worked as a Political Affairs officer for the United Nations in many field offices in areas of conflict (i.e foreign interference) for the United Nations MONUC (Ituri, Mahagi, Kwandroma and then Aru). He was also “appointed to head the Lord’s Resistance Army coordination cell which monitored LRA’s activities and coordinated the responses of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Sudan and the D.R. Congo.” Billet worked as a consultant for Open Society Foundations where his work informed the design for the “People’s Intelligence” concept. [Source: LinkedIn] He now works as analyst for the International Criminal Court where he oversaw a unit “which monitored and analysed occurrences of crimes across several countries including Afghanistan, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, Georgia, LRA affected areas, D.R. Congo and Libya.”</p>

<p>As the Earth’s final remaining resources continue to be depleted at an accelerated rate, as Imperial powers fight to exercise global domination, those living in geopolitical hot zones, can expect the West and it’s bourgeoisie army of “young leaders” to orchestrate the installation of “democracy” forcefully and strategically driven in to the very fabric of their sovereign nations. In-between Ted Talks, high level meetings at the UN, university lectures, and Starbuck lattes, the Harvard hit squad will carry out their marching orders dressed in Armani suits.</p>

<p>The options for outmaneuvering the tried and true methods of subjugation are limited. You can 1) run for your life 2) target those who bank on your naïveté and have sold you down the river with no systemic change 3) do nothing and be crushed by imperial forces and 4) organize like your life depended on it. Number one is not a good option since there is nowhere to run. Number two is affirmative action without freedom and self-determination. Number three means certain oppression. Number four is the only salvation.</p>

<p>It is not for those of us in the West to decide what options or measures are taken, this must only be afforded to those who will bear the consequences of each and every action – that is the citizens that comprise the homeland of the targeted state. What we are speaking of is self-determination. A simple moral code that colonial agents of empire are unable to grasp, and unwilling to accept.</p>

<p>As we reach the conclusion of this report, it is vital to make clear that this analysis is not in any way suggesting “that nonviolent resistance should not have a central role in any revolutionary struggles for social change, only that the twisted imperial-friendly narrative of nonviolence promoted by such individuals should be treated with extreme caution by all activists who wish to avoid being oppressed by US backed dictatorships or their latest equally toxic manifestation, US managed ‘democracies.” [<a href="https://www.countercurrents.org/barker260311.pdf">CANVAS[ing] For The Nonviolent Propaganda Offensive: Propaganda In The Service Of Imperial Projects</a>, March 26, 2011]</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Che Guevara, First Latin American Youth Congress, July 28, 1960:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">“There are government leaders here in Latin America who still advise us to lick the hand that wants to hit us, and spit on the one that wants to help us. [Applause] We answer these government leaders who, in the middle of the twentieth century, recommend bowing our heads. We say, first of all, that Cuba does not bow down before anyone…</p>

<p>“We, who belong to the Cuban Revolution-who are the entire people of Cuba-call our friends friends, and our enemies enemies. We don’t allow halfway terms: someone’s either a friend or an enemy. [Applause] We, the people of Cuba, don’t tell any nation on earth what they should do with the International Monetary Fund,for example. But we will not tolerate them coming to tell us what to do. We know what has to be done. If they want to do what we’d do good; if not, that’s up to them. But we will not tolerate anyone telling us what to do. Because we were here on our own up to the last moment, awaiting the direct aggression of the mightiest power in the capitalist world, and we did not ask help from anyone. We were prepared, together with our people, to resist up to the final consequences of our rebel spirit.”</p>
