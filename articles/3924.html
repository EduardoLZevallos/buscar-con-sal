<p><b>Webinar Recording– Brave Women, Strong Women: Power &amp; Protagonism in Nicaragua </b><br />
Hosted by the Nicaragua Solidarity Coalition, this webinar took place on Sunday 24 March. The webinar featured a 90-minute report back from a January 2024 delegation to Nicaragua which explored Nicaraguan women’s roles and experiences as active protagonists in their society. Link to the recording i<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_hsytEh6P0">s here. </a> <b>Sanctions </b></p>

<p>In a recent interview, Barbara Larcom and Jill Clark-Gollub from our international partner, the Nicaragua Solidarity Coalition, spoke of how increased US economic warfare waged against Nicaragua will only translate into a worsening of the migration problem in the US and affect supply chains in Central American and Caribbean countries that trade with Nicaragua. They also explained that Sandinismo has promoted people's participation in every aspect of social life, improving people's lives in human rights, healthcare, and gender equality, among others, and leading to an increase in infrastructure projects for citizens. To read the full interview see<a href="https://orinocotribune.com/more-sanctions-on-nicaragua-will-deepen-us-migration-crisis-nicaragua-solidarity-coalition-interview/"> here.</a></p>

<p>On March 25, the former UN Independent Expert on International Order, Alfred de Zayas, made a presentation to the UN Security Council about unilateral coercive measures (UCMs), often called "sanctions." He denounced UCMs and urged, "Let us ...stop referring to UCMs as 'sanctions'. The <b>only</b> legal sanctions are those imposed by this <b>Security Council</b>. Everything else constitutes the unlawful <b>use of force</b> in contravention of the letter and spirit of the UN Charter.... Moreover, the word 'sanctions' implies that the State imposing them has the moral or legal authority to do so. This is not the case...." To read his statement in full see<a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/bitacora/node/3807"> here.</a></p>

<p>The Member States of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – People's Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP) have issued a statement rejecting the unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States on Nicaragua – see lin<a href="https://www.albatcp.org/en/comunicado/albatcp-rejects-unilateral-coercive-measures-imposed-united-states-nicaragua/">k here<b> </b></a> <b> </b></p>

<p><b>Nicaragua is a Leader in Access to Health, says PAHO/WHO </b><br />
The representative in Nicaragua of the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization, Ana Elena Chévez, recently highlighted the advances presented by the country's Ministry of Health through a health map and emphasised that "Nicaragua is leading on the issue of access to health. It is an example and a health model that we have shared with other countries, as we believe it is the way. Working with families and communities is key to achieving these advances. The Ministry of Health alone cannot do it and that is why we believe that the Nicaraguan Health Model is an excellent example," she said. The map contains information on the advances in the reduction of maternal and infant deaths.</p>

<p>"When learning about this Health Map, every Nicaraguan should be proud of the progress that is being shown in an innovative way. I believe that with this, Nicaragua is giving an important example for other countries of how to manage data, how to present them in an accessible way for the entire population." She added that the data on the advances in the reduction of maternal death and infant death, reflect the political commitment of the Nicaraguan government.</p>

<p><b>India-UN Fund: Building Futures – South-South Cooperation Paves the Way for Inclusive Education in </b> <b>Nicaragua </b> <b> </b><br />
The Ministry of Education (MINED) in Nicaragua, with the support of UNICEF, has unveiled its latest initiative, the ‘More Inclusion’ Communication Strategy for Social and Behavioural Change to foster seamlessly integrating girls, boys, and adolescents with disabilities into the nation’s education system. With a focus on inclusivity, this effort marks a significant stride towards ensuring every child receives the opportunity to thrive academically.

<p><b>Palestine </b><br />
Nicaragua has been re-elected to the vice presidency of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People at the United Nations. The election took place on March 11 at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. The bureau is currently composed of Senegal, Chair of the Committee, and the Vice Chairs: Cuba, Indonesia, Malaysia, Namibia and Nicaragua. Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour congratulated the elected members of the bureau, expressing his appreciation to the committee as a whole for their efforts and work toward the realization of Palestinians' inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination, independence and the right of return of refugees, stating that his delegation will continue to work closely with the bureau to achieve these goals. He also stated that the priority continues to be saving the lives of the Palestinian people and insisted that they will not cease in their efforts to get the Security Council to finally approve a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>

<p>Nicaragua was first elected as a vice chair of the Palestine Committee in 2013 and since then, with each re-election, the solidarity of the government with the heroic Palestinian people is reaffirmed. Ambassador Jaime Hermida Castillo, Permanent UN Representative of Nicaragua, reiterated Nicaragua's support for Palestinian initiatives to become a full member of the United Nations, for a ceasefire, and support and funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). <b> </b> Nicaragua has indicted Germany at the International Court of Justice for complicity in the genocide of Palestinians. See press releas<a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/bitacora/node/3640">e here. </a> Preliminary hearings opened on 8 April, but it is likely that it will be some weeks before the ICJ delivers its preliminary decision. The hearing comes amid growing calls for allies to stop supplying arms to Israel as its six-month campaign continues to lay waste to Gaza.</p>

<p><b>40th anniversary of Nicaragua’s lawsuit against the US</b><br />
9 April this year marked the 40th anniversary of the lawsuit Nicaragua filed against the US in the Hague on April 9, 1984. The ICJ ruled that the US violated international law in its terror attacks on Nicaragua but to this day, the US still refuses to pay the reparations it legally owes.
