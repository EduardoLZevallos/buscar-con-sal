<p><b>Daniel's address</b><br />
<br />
Beloved Nicaraguan sisters and brothers, beloved families of the Pacific region and the Central region, the Northern and Southern Caribbean regions.  Our fraternal embrace to all our People!<br />
<br />
Compañera Rosario Murillo, Vice President of Nicaragua; Doctor Gustavo Porras, President of the National Assembly, of the Social Coordination, and President of FETSALUD; Army General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Commander in Chief of the Nicaraguan Army; First Commissioner General Francisco Díaz, Chief of the Nicaraguan National Police; Compañero Iván Acosta Montalván, Minister of Finance and Public Credit; Doctor Martha Reyes, Minister of Health; General Bayardo Rodríguez, Chief of Staff of the Nicaraguan Army; Commissioner General Adolfo Marenco, Second Chief of the National Police; Dr. Sonia Castro, Presidential Advisor for Health; General Marvin Elías Corrales, Inspector General of the Nicaraguan Army; Commissioner General Jaime Vanegas, Inspector General of the National Police; Dr. Roberto López, President of the Nicaraguan Institute of Social Security. Young people of Nicaraguan... the young, a Divine Treasure!<br />
<br />
Today we commemorate this 41st Anniversary under a series of measures to protect Life, in the face of an epidemic that has surprised even the developed countries, after all, how many epidemics there have been in the world throughout History, in recent times, and all the many who have died from those Epidemics have been in the developing countries, among the Peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America.<br />
<br />
And well, the developed countries were able to protect themselves such that these epidemics do not cause greater havoc in their nations. And this has to do with the economic model imposed on the world, and which has been considered perfect. Perfect, as long as it does not touch the pockets of Big Capital. In that sense, it is perfect.<br />
<br />
This epidemic, along with other diseases, I remember the last report we presented, it was presented by our Health Authorities, first daily, then, weekly, and here we have a report covering from March 11 to June 30, later on we will have the report from March 11 until the end of July. And already in this report to the end of June we find that in this period we had deaths resulting from different diseases, accidents, drowning, suicides, criminal acts and also from this epidemic, 12,100 Nicaraguans died; later, after the 19 days so far this month of July, there will be a few more. Of these deaths, 7,349 were male  and 4,751 were female. 507 children under 13 years old; 144 young people from 13 to 21 years old. And over 21 years old, 11,449.<br />
<br />
What were the causes of death in the different local health authorities, the country's health centers part of our Unified Public Health System, and also in the private hospitals and clinics? Pneumonia, 2,344; acute myocardial infarction, 1,908; diabetes mellitus, 1,425; hypertensive diseases, 890; malignant tumors, 853; chronic kidney diseases, 659; cerebrovascular accidents, 439 deaths; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 373; liver failure, 334; traffic accidents, 242, and so on for the different causes. Of course, there were also those who have died as a result of this epidemic, the number is now approaching 100, around 90 or so, approaching 100 of our Nicaraguan sisters and brothers. .. 91 to be precise.<br />
<br />
From deaths due to crime, we find 190 Nicaraguan sisters and brothers died in this period, 176 of them men and 14 women; and by age: under 13 years old, 2 children; from 13 to 21 years old, 16 youths; over 21 years old, 172.<br />
<br />
Deaths by drowning: 73 of our Nicaraguan brothers and sisters died by drowning.<br />
<br />
A total of 96 of our Nicaraguan brothers and sisters died by suicide: 84 men and 12 women, one of them a child under 13 years old; 22 young people between 13 and 21 years old, and 73 of our Nicaraguan sisters and brothers over 21 years old committed suicide.<br />
<br />
So then, throughout this period the work of the health sector has been intense... First, births have been cared for. Looking more closely, we find a total of 12,100 deaths, and 24,899 births. Twice as many births as deaths, thank God.<br />
<br />
A total of 7 million 951,935 outpatient and emergency consultations were made. During this period, 87,979 surgeries were performed, of which 12,616 were emergency surgeries, while 75,363 were programmed.<br />
<br />
A nutritional census was conducted, assessing 1,394,168 children under six years of age as well as students in the country's public primary schools. Up to June 30th, 2,270,000 doses of vaccines have been administered and some are still being administered to protect children, pregnant women and the elderly against 16 diseases.<br />
<br />
In the period from March 11 to June 30, a total of 21,619 pregnant women have been cared for in the maternity shelters. A total of 2,240 patients have been treated with kidney dialysis. A patient with renal problems who needs dialysis has to receive it every 3 days, 3 times a week; that is, 3 times a week which in fact is is a little less than three days... 3 times a week! And dialysis is expensive. Now I'll give you the numbers of dialysis machines we found on taking office, and the number of dialysis machines we have now, which are very expensive.<br />
<br />
And the cost of dialysis ! But the dialysis these patients receive does not cost them a cent, because the treatment is based on the principles of Sandino, of Carlos, it is based on the principles of the Sandinista Front, that achieved that great Victory 41 years ago, supported by Nicaragua's people.<br />
<br />
Then, as regards cancer patients. Chemotherapy has been administered to 3,257 patients. Chemotherapy is also an expensive treatment, and is applied without charging patients a cent. And for chemotherapy we now have a linear accelerator, this allows that when the treatment is done with radiation it targets the exact point; that's why they call it a linear accelerator, because it targets the exact point. Before it was like shooting with a shotgun, that is, you aimed at the exact point but what the device emitted covered a good part of the neighboring organs and therefore caused organ damage that could later lead to death. We are grateful for this device, which is a donation from the People and government of Japan.<br />
<br />
Now, with the taxes of Nicaraguans, thanks to the good administration of the health sector, as well as good administration by the Finance Minister, with our own resources we have been able to buy another unit, also a linear accelerator, which are very expensive. This device is already in the country and will soon be introduced to treat patients.<br />
<br />
Medicine for the Poor! Medicine for the less well off! Medicine for the Workers! Medicine for the People!<br />
<br />
In this period, 8,132 health promotion events were held and, too, mobile clinics were sent out to 14,039 communities. There the clinic goes out, you can see them on TV, where the mobile clinic reaches. They have the capacity to do examinations and to give treatment, and to attend the people with dentistry. It is very expensive to go to a dentist, so the people in rural communities are glad when the clinic arrives; in addition, they have specialized ultrasound equipment. And you can see on TV how the mobile clinic goes out to attend the population and give them medicine too.<br />
<br />
In the fight against epidemic diseases, one million 414,398 homes have been fumigated, most of them also treated with BTI, and another product to counter rats. Of course, we already know that the most serious problem we have here is mosquitoes because of all the diseases they transmit, which can be lethal. That is, there are also other kinds of disease that preceded this coronavirus as they call it, and that here have caused deaths, H1N1 and all those epidemics that we have had here, that we also have still and that we must control and hence the importance of vaccination.<br />
<br />
The Civil Defence Units of the Nicaraguan Army have joined this effort, and have been working late into the night, until the early hours of the morning. An army that is there to serve the people, to serve our families, without distinction. We see them there at midnight, at dawn, from commanding officers to the soldiers, all of them working.<br />
<br />
Health workers involved directly in the actions of the anti-epidemic struggle and community care number 21,707, and indirectly involved, 15,952; because of course, there must be medical staff to offer basic care in the hospitals. Giving a total of 37,659 Health Workers, in the public and private Sectors.<br />
<br />
Then, in the case of this COVID-19 as it is called, up until June 30 we had 83 deaths. Confirmed cases were 2,182, recovered cases were 1,750, cases under responsible and careful monitoring were 349, and 83 deaths, now we have 91 deaths; as of Tuesday of last week we have 91, now we have to wait for the information next Tuesday when the Ministry of Health will give the report.<br />
<br />
From 2007 to date, the following investments have been made in health infrastructure: 19 hospitals have been built, which explains the capacity now to care for the population; 2 national hospitals, a departmental hospital and 16 primary hospitals, 18 health centres, 452 health posts, 128 maternity shelters, one institute of natural medicine and complementary therapies and 15 subsidiaries of that institute, 188 clinics of natural medicine and complementary therapies, 70 clinics for pain management.<br />
<br />
And there are units under construction, construction has not stopped. It didn't stop in April 2018, nor has it stopped now. The construction of 7 new Hospitals, of a maternity shelter, and we already have the funds, both from foreign development cooperation and from our own resources, that is, the effort of Nicaraguans, and they are in the bidding process, to see how much companies may charge, 7 more hospitals, a regional epidemiological laboratory, and a maternity shelter. In other words, we continue to build for health care, because health is fundamental, it is basic.<br />
<br />
What does a family do if there is no health? They lose the ability to work, they get sick all the time. What do children and young people do without health? They lose the ability to go to school, they get sick. And what do workers do without health, construction workers, fishermen, shopkeepers? What does any Nicaraguan do without health care? Only people who have... What do the rural families do without health care? Well, productive activity would fail, and there we would go hungry and many people in our country would die of hunger, just as thousands of thousands and millions of human beings die every day all over the planet, from hunger! Because that is the worst epidemic.<br />
<br />
The worst epidemic is the one that causes hunger, the epidemic of savage capitalism, which was fully imposed in the world until this epidemic came and shook it. It has shaken savage capitalism and is telling them, "that is not the way to go". It is shouting at them, "this is not the way", and that if they want to protect their peoples, because with all their capacities, with all their wealth they have been unable to protect their citizens, because their hospitals have been overwhelmed, because they did not have the equipment to attend the emergencies, in the developed countries of Europe, and in the United States of America, that great power that spends billions on war, on death. How many Americans, and how sorry we are for them, died for lack of medical care in the United States.<br />
<br />
What this exposes is the failure of that model, and this is the warning God is making,  via the force of Nature, to savage capitalism: change course, for it to change its course, and for it learn to practice trade, social development, economic development, financial development based on Solidarity and Justice, which is what will give Peace and Tranquility to all the inhabitants of our planet.<br />
<br />
Then too, I want to give you this information about the high technology equipment that has been incorporated in our country in the different public sector hospitals, from CAT scanners to magnetic resonance units: 28 CAT scanners and 9 resonance units have been incorporated. How much does a Magnetic Resonance cost? ¿How much does it cost? And it's quoted in dollars. In other words, a hard-working, low income, dedicated person who has children in school, who has to pay for the bus to get there, cannot pay. So this technology is precisely to care for those who do not have the capacity to pay.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And through the Everyone has a Voice Program, from 2009 to 2020, 156,113 people with disabilities have been attended to, and 2 million 446,474 visits have been made to their homes and they have been helped with equipment. This is worth a close look, this is a program that was set up here visiting the homes of the most impoverished families, and visiting not only the impoverished homes in the cities and towns, but also in the countryside and in remote mountain areas.<br />
<br />
You may remember when the doctors went out on that program, and a Cuban medical brigade also came to support us in that project, because of the enormous experience that the Cuban brothers and sister have in that field, and it was to go to the house to identify the condition that the members of those Families had there, from the children to the adults, to the elderly.<br />
<br />
And too we now have 80 Mobile Clinics, and this has to do with Security, you know that Security is fundamental to be able to advance in all these projects, in all these programs. In that sense the Army and the Police are fundamental for the country's security, for the country's stability, for the country's Peace. Because all these programs can only be carried out when there is Peace. If there is no Peace, then it is impossible to develop these programs. Why? Because what has happened on other occasions can take place. They destroy ambulances, they kill the transport workers, health workers, education workers. They kill them. Therefore, the programs iare impossible if there is no Peace.<br />
<br />
We experienced this in the years after the Triumph in 1979. They destroyed transport teams building roads up there in the mountains. They destroyed hospitals, health posts. They murdered teachers, they murdered doctors... Thousands of people were killed! There were more than 50,000 victims of that terrible war imposed on us by the US Government, in 1979, only after the triumph of the Revolution and the start of the Literacy Crusade, until 1990, when it was brought to an end with the Peace Accords.<br />
<br />
But there were remnants of that war, there were remnants who continued to commit crimes against impoverished families, against families that did not give them what they asked for; and also to assassinate Sandinista leaders, and to assassinate judges, to assassinate entire families. And this was fed, financed, and armed...!<br />
<br />
The police were constantly fighting against this, as was the army, which has to provide security on rural farms and protect the frontier areas, it has to safeguard the sovereignty of the country. The Police, the Army that have to face drugs trafficking.<br />
<br />
These people killed in all that period, from 1990, let's see, until April 2019, they killed more than 400 brothers and sisters, among them Police and comrades of the Army who were murdered, I recall, by some drug dealers in a Caribbean Community, where they ambushed the comrades of the Army trevelling by panga to the point where a plane had fallen with the drugs and with a Colombian on board. But immediately the Empire's organizations, on the Empire's payroll called "human rights organizations", began to criticize the Army and began to criticize the Police, despite the deaths being suffered by the Army and by the Police.<br />
<br />
So, peace and security are fundamental for progress to be made in all these areas.<br />
<br />
I mention this issue in relation to the Mobile Clinics because it has to do with the fight against drug trafficking, the trucks captured from the drug dealers... In other words, in principle, when a drug trafficker is caught with a property, some movable or fixed asset, that property immediately becomes the property of the State, and then, if it is sold, or whatever, the fund is used to cover our social programs.<br />
<br />
So these trucks, thanks to the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime, which leads to the capture of these trucks, that allows us to have these truck units turned into hospitals, mobile clinics, traveling throughout our country, thanks to the Police and the Army.<br />
<br />
Note that with these Mobile Clinics, between 2017 and 2020, 5 million 601,287 Nicaraguans have now been cared for.<br />
<br />
This is data that is not widely disseminated, because generally speaking, the mainstream press and media in the World, with a few exceptions, naturally always seek sensationalism.<br />
<br />
But if we look closely, then from 2013 to 2020, that is over 7 years, in "La Mascota", which as we all know is the national hospital for children, they have done 920 heart surgeries. That is not easy, to operate on a child's heart. There have been times when a child being treated at "La Mascota" is so small and the operation is so complicated that foreign cooperation is sought via exchanges with countries where there is better capacity to do these complicated operations. And we have sent children out to other countries in this way, and they have returned home well.<br />
<br />
Also what I was saying... about dialysis, for those who suffer from kidney disease, a terrible disease, in 2006, when we returned to government, when the People President, the Rural Worker Presidents, the Industrial Worker Presidents, the Women Presidents, the Youth President, when the whole People took over the Presidency, back then there were just 34 machines for hemodialysis. Take note, 34 hemodialysis machines for 96 patients, with kidney complaints. There are Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, there are young people who suffer from the kidneys, who may have already lost one kidney or lost use of both kidneys and are now demanding hemodialysis; also adults.<br />
<br />
Now in 2020 we feel proud to say to the face of those who destroy hospitals and health Posts, that we can now count with, up from 34 machines, 332 machines for hemodialysis, caring now, up from 96 patients to 2,270 patients. And then too in relation to transplants, kidney transplants are also very expensive, if you look at private medicine they are very expensive, and then too it is also not easy to find a donor, even someone from the same Family does not always succeed in being compatible with the person who needs the kidney. There have been 159 kidney transplants, that is, 159 Nicaraguans who have benefited from them.<br />
<br />
People with HIV have been treated and 436,266 tests were carried out in 2019. In terms of treatment for patients who tested positive, the tests showed 5,696 patients who tested positive, and thus it was possible to cut transmission from mother to child in the case of women, or from father to child in the case of men.<br />
<br />
In 2006, a total of 111,194 surgeries were performed here in the Health System; from 2006 to 2019, not counting 2020, 460,641 surgeries have been performed, as against 111,000, mind. The number of surgeries has quadrupled.<br />
<br />
Oral health has been addressed in the public elementary Schools, with 15 fluoride rinses for each student performed annually to prevent dental caries.<br />
<br />
<br />
As regards maternal health, we have also informed about maternal health, births, and also other exam procedures that have to do with the attention of both women and men.<br />
<br />
These are data that I wanted to highlight most, there is much more data, but I wanted to highlight these data because they are important.<br />
<br />
But this data is important too... In 2006, there were 22,083 male and female workers in the Ministry of Health, and in 2020 that has increased, so it requires a bigger budget, it demands more State spending, more budget allocation to the health sector. Health staff have increased from 22,000 to 36,983 workers, and from 2,715 doctors in the health system in 2006, today we have 6,182 doctors in the health system, which is practically triple. In terms of nursing personnel, in 2006 we had 6,384 Nurses and Nurses, and now we have 11,050 Nurses and Nurses. And then the number of doctors that have been trained, and specialists; more than 11,000 medical personnel, and specialists too.<br />
<br />
We've already given the other information... So you might say say, "Well, what does that mean?" What does it mean for someone who has a condition, and at any time, any citizen, of any color, poor or rich, can have a condition that affects their health.<br />
<br />
And we have incorporated 33 new endoscopy units and 30 laparoscopy units to diagnose and treatm respiratory and digestive diseases  ... all those conditions causing suffering to young people, adults, elderly people, children, and now you have to have these instruments to be able to give a good diagnosis and thus good treatment; otherwise, it is not easy to make a good diagnosis so as to give good treatment.<br />
<br />
In 2006, to diagnose breast cancer affecting our heroic women, there was only one mammography machine in the hospitals. By 2020, we can say we now have 28 mammography machines, that is 27 more.<br />
<br />
128 cryotherapy units and 97 colposcopy units to be able to attend to the cervical-uterine lesions suffered by our women covering 80% of our municipalities.<br />
<br />
Because, as I have said, obviously all this is difficult, addressing all this is difficult. In 2006, the budget of MINSA was 3,280 million córdobas, equivalent to 13% of the national budget. In 2020 the current health budget is 16,100 million córdobas, which is equivalent to 20% of the General Budget of the Republic, 5 times greater than in 2006. A fivefold increase since then.<br />
<br />
In other words, because we had all these capacity installed and which we continue to install, we have been able to successfully confront this pandemic. It has allowed us to successfully confront this pandemic, in compliance with the indications given to us by the health authorities who are the specialists in the field.<br />
<br />
One can read a lot and see that there is a lot of discussion among scientists, some give one information, others give another information, they contradict each other. That is to say, it is still not totally clear how to address the problem, as has been achieved in the case of other viruses that have affected these countries, above all countries where  it was still unknown but where now it has arrived.<br />
<br />
We have to continue maintaining protective measures, from the family to work, from the family to school, from the family to university, from the family to the army unit, from the family to the Police unit, from the family so that  all of us protect ourselves. And as regards the steps to be taken when there are symptoms. It is very common to come across Nicaraguan brothers and sisters who, instead of going to the nearest medical post immediately when they are already sick, with indications of flu, and a flu must be treated, because a flu that is already seasonal here, like H1N1, can lead to pneumonia if it is not treated, and the patient dies. How many deaths have we had just from simple pneumonia?<br />
<br />
In this case, if they are not attended to quickly but instead go to a pharmacy to give them a prescription, or they look for help from a friend, and because they did not go to the Hospital, when they do arrive they are already lacking oxygen, so they feel out of breath or they are suffocating. Until that point they arrive and at that moment this person who arrived at the Hospital has their lungs affected, they have arrived  already in a serious state, arrived in a critical state and they have to be put immediately on a respirator to recover.<br />
<br />
Because they arrive with a very low degree of saturation, some arrive with 50% saturation when they should have 90 or more; others arrive with 70, already suffocating, yes, many sister and brothers, many comrades, and then they have to take extreme measures when they get complicated,and even more so if they suffer from other diseases, if they suffer from diabetes, if they suffer from heart problems, everything gets complicated at that moment, and then comes what they call intubation, which is a critical moment.<br />
<br />
But thank God, I would say that we have a high percentage, in due time we will give all the data, of Nicaraguan sister and brothers who have been intubated and have managed to survive. Of course, it is a situation that has to do with the patient's characteristics, younger patients of 40, 44, 50 years of age, but who may be very fat,<br />
<br />
They call it co-morbidity, and people suffer from diabetes, they suffer from high blood pressure, so those comrades are more likely to die. But also we see a 91 year old woman, there we have seen her leaving hospital after spending a long time in hospital, being cared for... 91 years old!<br />
 </p>

<p>So, here the effort made by the national health system is enormous, the Military Hospital, the Huembes Hospital, the Police Hospital, the Private Hospitals and the Private Clinics that are providing services and care in this field. Well, there has been a strong influx, but because we already had this system set up in hospitals, health posts, we managed quickly, accompanied as well by international representatives, to install intensive care units. In several hospitals they were installed, and there have been film reports of when they were set up, the beds, completely empty, were new beds, all clean and with all the equipment to follow up a patient in serious condition. That is what has allowed us to successfully face this pandemic.<br />
<br />
And yes, we are very carefully managing the entry of those who come from other countries, from sisters and brothers of other Nations who come to Nicaragua for work, some even come as tourists. Well, we have taken measures so that, beforehand, they can present the test result, which has to be negative, so that they can enter, and then at the airport they are tested again there too; the pilots who come in the plane, the same, the test; the plane must also be disinfected.<br />
<br />
Of course, we are concerned too about Nicaraguans who are in other countries being able to return to Nicaragua, but that has to be done in an orderly fashion. Just look at how the borders have been closed around the world, even in developed countries.<br />
<br />
Well, here we open the door, but with the proper measures being taken. And what does this mean? It means Nicaraguans been returning from different countries. For example, from the United States, Nicaraguans come continuously, who are deported, the deportees come here to Nicaragua; then, there are the Nicaraguan brothers who are in Panama, or who are in El Salvador, or who are in some other country.<br />
<br />
Those who were in Panama have to pass through Costa Rica, so Costa Rica also takes its measures, and what we have done is to establish a mechanism with Costa Rica so that this transit can take place in an orderly way, and most of the sisters and brothers have already entered. Some want to return to Panama, for sure they must have already found a new job there in Panama, because many Nicaraguans work in Panama.<br />
<br />
Then, on the flights that have been leaving for the United States, hundreds of Nicaraguans have left. Of course, they are Nicaraguans who probably already had their job secured there and the people who give them the job are most concerned. Because right now, with the measures that the United States Government has tried to take against immigrants who have jobs, American businessmen, big American companies are the first to tell their government no, let the people stay, because there are qualified people there, and also people with low paid jobs who are the only one doing those low paid jobs there in the United States, or in a developed country, as immigrants; whether they are Central Americans or Mexicans, they are the ones who do that kind of work.<br />
<br />
That explains, and when I see the list, I say, look, there are a hundred and fifty Nicaraguans on this flight which is supposed to be humanitarian, and there are 50 foreigners; and those 150 Nicaraguans go to the United States. And then another flight with 90-something Nicaraguans, and about 60 or 70 foreigners. And then another flight, the same, and another one that is also scheduled for the United States. And another flight that left for Spain also with a lot of Nicaraguans, it was supposed to take only Europeans who were in these parts and wanted to return to Europe via Spain, but most of them were Nicaraguans, although, yes, some were Europeans, Spanish, French, from different countries in Europe.<br />
<br />
So, all this is part of the measures we have worked out, measures we have taken, and where obviously it is fundamental to coordinate between the institutions, the State workers, of different institutions, to be able to ensure we protect Nicaraguans.<br />
<br />
There are also those who came from Europe, the sisters and brothers from the Caribbean Coast, from Corn Island, from Bluefields, from Bilwi, hundreds who were on the cruise ships, but that was well organized and they have entered, several hundred Nicaraguan sisters and brothers have entered in an orderly manner, it is out of the question that they enter in a disorderly manner. To contaminate their family in the first place, that is not correct, or to contaminate the neighborhood, if they come contaminated; that is why it is important first to verify that they come with their Certificate.<br />
<br />
Then, along with these efforts that we are making with the health sector, we have to recognize the working spirit of the Nicaraguans, the working spirit of rural families, who in the worst moments have not stopped producing, have not stopped working. The commitment of the government institutions, of the People's Government, is to visit the producers. So that in their production have a greater and better performance, training, giving them inputs, giving them facilities, so that rural families who are in productive activity, small producers, who have no chance of having the productivity of a large producer, a medium producer, these small producers can improve their ability to produce corn, produce beans, produce coffee, produce vegetables, produce plantain. And they are indeed working.<br />
<br />
Throughout this period we have not stopped building roads, highways ... Our acknowledgment to all the workers of our People, those who are in the State institutions, the construction workers, the Customs workers, the Migration Service workers, the education workers, to the primary teachers, to the secondary teachers, who are all so dear to us; to all the workers; to those who are in the Finance Ministry which means having to manage the economy in these conditions.<br />
<br />
Look at the hardship taking place in Europe, powerful countries, the hardship happening in the United States, where it is no problem for them to take out billions of dollars to try to solve the emergency, and they have not been able to do so. And then how do they get out of this situation? The Europeans are negotiating among themselves. The United States has not yet stabilized its economy. We are not happy that the North American economy is affected, we are not happy that the European economy is affected, because the first ones affected are those same Peoples, and our Peoples are also affected because we have trade with those Peoples, with the business people of those countries.<br />
<br />
So, what does it mean to manage an economy like ours, so small, so fragile, and under attack by the Empire? Yes, under attack by the Empire! In other words, something totally brutal. In other words, an Empire as powerful as this one, savaging a country like Nicaragua, trying to harm the Nicaraguan people, trying to demoralize the Nicaraguan people, trying to intimidate the Nicaraguan people. But the People have demonstrated, in the most difficult circumstances, that this People is not cowardly, this is a Brave People.<br />
<br />
The People through whose veins runs the blood of Diriangén, of Nicarao, the People through whose veins runs the blood of those who fought for the Independence of Central America 199 years ago as it will be now in September, and then next year in September will be the 200th Anniversary of the Independence of our Region; of those who fought against the first Yankee expansionist invaders and defeated them on September 14 in the Battle of San Jacinto: Andrés Castro, José Dolores Estrada, there are our Heroes.<br />
<br />
And too those who faced the Yankee invasion in 1912, led by General Benjamin Zeledón, who gave his life defending the country. He was no coward, everyone knows that! Those who fought and raised the Red and Black Flag with General Sandino, to rescue the White and Blue Flag of our Homeland by expelling the invaders, as, in those years, they did.<br />
<br />
Then came the crime, the murder of Sandino after he had embraced with Somoza. The Yankees hatched the plan with Somoza to kill Sandino, Sandino who had signed the Peace. He was assassinated, after the President offered him a dinner; the President didn't even realize that Somoza had already set up the whole plan with the U.S. Ambassador.<br />
<br />
Watch out for the U.S. Ambassadors! Watch out for those U.S. Ambassadors! Yes, that's where the order came from Washington to assassinate Sandino. The Yankees did not accept the humiliation that our General of Free Men had caused them, defeating them and expelling them from our land... They couldn't defeat him!<br />
<br />
We faced these huge challenges, these enormous challenges, and we have always managed to come out ahead. In the face of the greatest challenges we have managed to come out ahead.<br />
<br />
And today, in this Plaza, in this same place, where 41 years ago on July 20th we gathered to celebrate the Triumph of the Sandinista Popular Revolution on July 19th, in this same Plaza, in this same place, while we were celebrating here there were still brothers and sisters who were fighting, because Somoza's National Guard was retreating and they were fighting in the West, by Chinandega; We were in León, I remember, and the fighting was going on near Nagarote, near La Paz Centro, and also towards Chinandega. Likewise, on the route going North, to Matagalpa, passing through Dario, through Sébaco, and there were many brothers and sisters there, among them, our Army Chief, General Julio César Avilés, who could not be here on that 20th, because they were still fighting there by Sébaco.<br />
<br />
They were the columns that were fighting and that would later enter Managua. All the fighters couldn't enter at the time because there was fighting on several sides with the guards that were fleeing, they were armed, so they had to be ready to defend themselves.<br />
<br />
Today, on the 41st Anniversary, we give faith that what we said and swore in this Plaza 41 years ago, exactly in that place, at the foot of the National Palace, where our General Sandino is, where Carlos is, we said it with the certainty that we were carrying the Flag of Dignity of our General Sandino, which Carlos inherited and which he transferred to the Nicaraguan people who entered triumphantly here on July 19, and celebrated in the Plaza on July 20, 1979.<br />
<br />
And our Commitment is for Peace, for Unity, for the Stability of the Nicaraguan People, and to continue together all of us fighting the Pandemic, and all together to continue producing, and all together to continue studying, to continue preparing ourselves, to continue together all of us doing Culture, Sport, but always observing the measures ordered by the health authorities.<br />
<br />
Beloved sisters and brothers, beloved Families, under this Heaven, with our feet on this Earth that has the arm of a river embracing it from the South, which is the San Juan River, and has another arm of a river embracing it from the North, which is the Coco or Wangki River, from these lands that have a sea, the Pacific Sea, that borders our coast on one side, and the Caribbean Sea that borders our coast on the other side, this Land privileged by God, a Land assigned by God, this Land of Brave Men and Women, we say to the Heroes and Martyrs, we say to Sandino, to Carlos, to Tomás, we say to all the families of our Heroes and Martyrs, to the Historic Combatants, to the Army retirees, to the Ministry of the Interior retirees, to the rural families, to the Workers, that all together, with our young people, we continue fighting, continue working for Peace, for Life and for the Health of our People and our Nation.<br />
<br />
Sandino Lives, the Struggle Goes On!<br />
<br />
A Free Homeland or Death!</p>
