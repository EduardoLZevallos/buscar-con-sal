<p>Today, May 1st, our deep and sincere homage, from heart to heart, to all the working families of Nicaragua, wherever we may be working... Christian goodness, love and solidarity to all our Families !<br />
 <br />
These are times of great challenges, and these challenges, these menaces, demand that we strengthen our conscience and commitment to the Common Good, of living together and sharing. And we embrace each other, precisely by travelling through all our shared paths, dreams, values, efforts, struggles, and our great hopes, with the Trust we place in our God who knows everything, sees everything, can do everything, that God who illuminates and guides us all, because we are his daughters and sons.<br />
 <br />
We all deserve to live with dignity, in Peace and able to work for our well being, for a good and fruitful Life, based on the supreme values of faith, family and community... Life to create, to recreate, to work !<br />
 <br />
Always moving onward ! Our hard working People, always striving and admirable ! There is so much love in our Nicaragua, so much healthy energy, energy and gratitude that knows how to recognize God, above all things. Natural joyful energy, because we believe in and practice goodwill and truth. We are not advocates of slander, or infamy or lies. Every day, good hope gives us strength, and that good hope grows with our conscience, our intelligence, and our understanding of what is really valuable, what really counts, for the human being and for Humanity: Dignity, Security, Work, Peace, Good Will !<br />
 <br />
In this Nicaragua committed to Life, to protecting and promoting Life in all its forms... In this dignified, sovereign, courageous, noble Nicaragua, let's move forward, working and laboring every day, to earn an honest living, and to consolidate Peace.<br />
 <br />
Let's move forward, always looking ahead, banishing selfishness and unhealthy selfish display. Such a terrible weakness, the ego and selfish display ...! Banishing too the slanders, lies and falsehoods, that pandemic of iniquity promoting destruction across the whole world, affecting individuals, families, communities, whole countries, slandering and destroying reputations, arbitrarily, as a result of  excessive ambition on the part of a few.<br />
 <br />
The whole world has denounced and condemned falsehood, and the precise purpose of all that falsehood too, namely to continue grabbing the very means of Life that belong to us all, that belong to all people. These are the very means of Life certain minorities have managed to seize,  what exactly? All the sweat, tears and suffering, all the wounds of the Peoples of the World. The Wounds of Christ ! The Peoples of the World who have suffered so much from this selfishness, this greed, this avarice,  condemning us all to misfortune and especially to human misery. But let's move ahead, and let's escape from that human misery, with the strength God has given us.<br />
 <br />
In our Christian, solidarity based Nicaragua, we always look further ahead, every day we denounce ignominy and hatred. We daily denounce the assault on the Peoples' patrimony. And that should motivate the will of so many millions of human beings who have been deprived by a catastrophic and inhumane system, deprived of decent work, of the right to decent work, to the livelihoods that the Peoples deserve, of the Right to Health and to defense against serious evils like COVID-19.<br />
 <br />
COVID-19, this pandemic that has affected people's health and caused so much loss and grief to so many families throughout the World, with all of whom we stand in solidarity. COVID-19 has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate the unreality of what some consider paradise. They want to sell us as paradise, systems that are unjust, fragile, socially weak, and the people who want to sell us those kingdoms of lies as if they were paradises also have their owners and their bosses... there in those kingdoms of falsehood they have made their own. Owners and bosses giving them orders that they gladly obey, like slaves!<br />
 <br />
Everything has been uncovered. The truth is there before our eyes. No working family in this World overwhelmed by so many crises, can fail to see the cruelty shown to us by the great truths that have been revealed, the nakedness that has been exposed, the hypocrisy, the make believe, the falsehoods they have deceived us with and still try and sell us, continuing to sell false superiorities, arrogance, supremacism, lordly dominion. The truth is that they are really infernal spirits, and even amidst all the anxiety that the world is experiencing, they have no sense of how ridiculous they look, how mean and mediocre, as is becoming more and more self-evident. They have no sense of their absurdity, of the nakedness of all their weaknesses, frailties, and falsehoods.<br />
 <br />
No working family in the world will stop dreaming of the right that we all have to respect for our dignity, the right to creative, productive and dignified work, to our cultural values, to our own way of doing things, to our cultural and natural heritage.<br />
 <br />
Who has decreed that some are superior to others? Who has decreed that anyone is superior to another? God has not decreed that. God made us all equal as his children. But they have stolen our wealth and they intend to continue stealing it because they are decadent empires collapsing like a house of cards, displaying, exposing all the lies, falsehoods and injustices on which they have been built.<br />
 <br />
But we have said and we repeat it at every opportunity, God is great, God is omnipotent, God is merciful. And we are learning, because all of us must learn. We are on the right way. We are on the right path. Life is made up of  struggles, between some people united in cynically defending their pretence to  privilege, and the majorities throughout the world, the Peoples of the World, demanding their right to live as a Human Family, with the respect we owe each other, as one to another.<br />
 <br />
In these times of collapsing towers, all Peoples, speaking of Peoples, we are all looking for safe arks and alliances,to help us emerge from the flood into a better World, and we must make our dreams, aspirations and our rights count, and make possible that other, better, solidarity based, more human World and bring it closer.<br />
 <br />
On the Day of the Workers, of working families, of the whole world and of our Nicaragua, on the Day of honourable and dignified Work, let's give honour and glory to the Peoples of the World, to the heroic, brave, courageous People of our Nicaragua, whose very emblem is Work. We are  ever more clear in the whole world about what we are, because we are human beings with the right to dignity, to work, to respectful and harmonious coexistence, to Peace. As Dario said, we know who we are, we know where we come from, and we know where we are going.<br />
 <br />
<strong>The struggles and victories belong<br />
to the Working Peoples of the World !<br />
