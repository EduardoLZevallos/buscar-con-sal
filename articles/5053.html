<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Good afternoon, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, Nicaraguan families... Youth, Divine Treasure! Students of this Nation which fought a Glorious Battle, the First Glorious Battle! Barely after the year 1821 with that Declaration of Independence in Guatemala, of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. In 1821.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And in 1855, you see, 34 years after Independence, our Independence and that of all Central America was threatened by the invasion of the slaveholders and expansionists of Yankee Imperialism, led by William Walker, brought here by, who brought him? Those who sold out their Nation! The sell outs of the ruling classes then. Liberals and Conservatives paid homage to William Walker.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And the people began to fight, the Patriots, Heroes like General José Dolores Estrada, took the lead in the Battles against the Yankee filibusters. But still they managed to occupy the city of Granada, which was the only city they managed to take. Meanwhile, Walker had already had himself elected by the sell outs, President of Nicaragua, he was President of Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And Walker had already appointed his Ambassador to the United States Government, the United States Government headed by President Franklin Pierce of the Democratic Party. And who did he appoint as Ambassador, Walker? A fellow who had betrayed Christ, because he was a Priest, yes, a Priest, Priest Agustín Vijil, was a Chaplain and he started here giving his Homilies, his Sermons in the Churches, praising Walker, welcoming the filibusters who were coming, as he said, to set Nicaragua free. And no bishops who said anything against this Priest, nor did the Pope there in the Vatican say anything asking: why this Priest?</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So Walker appointed him Ambassador to the Government of the United States, and away this Priest went, to the United States, where President Franklin Pierce received him. Well, in that moment this was great news and reason for joy among the forces that dominate the United States people. The great news was that they had taken Nicaragua, they already felt that Nicaragua was becoming yet one more State of the United States, one more little star of the United States.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And Walker, something that cannot be forgotten, the first thing he decreed, on becoming President, he decreed slavery in Nicaragua. Just look at the kind of Democrat he was! This is the famous Democracy so much talked about, that both the Europeans or rather European governments, as well as the United States governments, moved by the economic interests of savage capitalism, dedicated themselves to turning the Peoples of Africa into slaves, and shipping them from Africa to Europe, and from Europe to this Region, and also taking them to the United States to turn them into slaves.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And still they say they are Democrats. They are, in fact, the enemies of democracy, enemies of their People, enemies of our Peoples, that cannot be forgotten and must not be forgotten.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="230" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/401164.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">This historic day, and it is a historic day because it is the first defeat of the Yankee Imperialists in Our America, here in Nicaragua, there in San Jacinto, with General José Dolores Estrada at the head, and Andrés, Andrés casting his Stone in defense the Sovereignty of Nicaragua, confronting the invaders.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In the end, what was left for the invaders, after already being defeated by the Nicaraguan Patriots, all that was left for them was to burn down the City of Granada. That is, they left the City of Granada on fire and put up a sign that said "Here was Granada”, but they fled, and there in the port a ship of the United States government was waiting to carry them to the United States again, where they were welcomed as heroes.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But that first defeat of Yankee expansionism, of Yankee imperialism, was, for all of us, a proud one here in Nicaragua, at the Hacienda San Jacinto, and today we are commemorating the 168th Anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto, at the same time as we commemorate the 203rd Anniversary of Independence.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">There too at our Independence you could see the attitude of some Senior Clergy who were opposed to Independence, who were against Independence; Bishops and so on.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">However, in the end it was achieved thanks to the pressure of the People, because some were about to seek an Independence agreement whereby we were to be subjected to the Iturbide Empire which, at the same time, was subject to the Spanish Empire.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Thus it was a maneuver: We were becoming independent of Spain and we were being annexed to the Empire of Iturbide. And that was the debate. And what decided that debate? The People. The People arrived, the impoverished people arrived, the Peasants, the Indigenous People arrived to claim full independence from Spain, and under no circumstances to be annexed in that way to the Spanish Empire. And finally those who were gathered there subscribed to Independence.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And really, the acid test of the Independence achieved by Nicaragua in 1821, was the invasion of the Yankees, with the Battle of San Jacinto defeating the invaders and defending our Nation's Sovereignty and Independence.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Nicaraguan brothers and Sisters, Students, Young People from all the Regions of our Country, from all the Municipalities of our Country, from all the Departments of our Country; Students who, with the support of Families and with the Programs that we have developed, are now managing to make progress going forward in terms of Knowledge. Knowledge is fundamental to being free, to be able to have decision-making power and to be able to grow in all aspects. Knowledge is basic.<br />

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's why with regard to literacy, wherever an illiterate person may appear, we have to immediately make sure they become literate, because we have managed to defeat illiteracy in our Country. And now instead we are growing, thanks to Education in the Cities, in the Neighborhoods, in the Countryside, where barefoot Peasants can go to study even to acquire University Degrees, so that Nicaragua can continue in this way, along this Path, which is the Path of Peace.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Peace is fundamental for us to keep moving forward, for us to be able have this beautiful Celebration. This is a truly extraordinary, beautiful Celebration, full of Love, full of Peace, full of Joy, with all the Strength and Vitality of our Young People and their Families who accompany them, and of the millions of Nicaraguans who are following us in this Transmission that which is a National broadcast. The transmission of this Commemoration is reaching every last corner of Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We are also going to salute and congratulate all the Schools, all the Boys, Girls, Children, Young People, and Teachers who have been marching every day this September, in their Districts, in their Municipalities, in their Neighborhoods. At this very moment today they are holding parades in all the Departments of our Country, commemorating these Historic Dates.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We are going to take an oath before God, before this Patriotic Nation, we are going to take this oath before our Families, before our National Heroes and Forbears that, as Students, as Young People, with a Vocation and a Spirit of Service to achieve their dreams and to contribute to the development of our Country, so that we achieve a Dignified Life every day, in Peace and Tranquility, such that all Nicaraguan Families feel Safe and Blessed with our Model of Christian, Socialist and Solidarity inspired Ideals and Values.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We swear this before the People, before the Nation, and above all we swear it before God, before Christ Our Lord. If we abide by it, our People and God will recognize we have done so, and we are sure that we are doing so already, and that you will continue to do so now.</p>
