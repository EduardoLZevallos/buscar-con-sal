            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : Can you comment on opposition criticism
            of the transparency of the use of ALBA funds?<br>
            <br>
            Ivan Acosta : The opposition is either ill-informed or
            irresponsible. Because in recent years we have had ALBA
            development cooperation coexisting with an International
            Monetary Fund agreement and those agreements demand
            transparency. You cannot have a programme with the IMF if
            you don't have transparency.<br>
            <br>
            You can see that in each of the six reviews by the IMF,
            Nicaragua has complied ahead of time with the financial
            requirements , the economic requirements and the legal
            requirements. That shows that the economic policy of
            Comandante Ortega's government is highly responsible, taking
            care to maintain stability, fiscal and monetary stability
            and above all adhering to legality in the use of development
            cooperation resources.<br>
            <br>
            The ALBA funds are part of the Central Bank's reporting,
            that is to say that all the IMF's member countries have
            access to Nicaragua's report on the use of the Bolivarian
            cooperation resources. So, we think that demonstrates the
            good attitude and commitment of the Nicaraguan government to
            transparency and the good use of development cooperation
            resources in the country.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : The opposition also question ALBA's contribution to
            the country's economic stability. Can you sum up ALBA's
            importance for Nicaragua's economy?<br>
            <br>
            Ivan Acosta : I don't think the opposition are coherent
            because one moment they are saying they don't see what's
            been built and the next they are saying they all want to
            maintain ALBA's development cooperation.&nbsp; But the most
            important thing is for people in Nicaragua to recognise the
            impact of the development cooperation of the Bolivarian
            People's Alliance on the country. They see it every day they
            get up to go out into economic activity.<br>
            <br>
            They find it in transport in the capital city and transport
            in general has had resources relating to&nbsp; Bolivarian
            development cooperation. There are the preferential
            tranpsort fares and the preferential proce of electricity.
            We're talking about finance for production<br>
            <br>
            We're talking about roofing programmes for the country
            involving millions, more than three million sheets of
            galvanised roofing for people in Nicaragua. We're talking
            about housing for people. We're talking about paved streets
            for people.<br>
            <br>
            But above all there are two programmes which are emblematic
            which benefit Nicaraguan women: the Productive Food
            Programme or Productive Bonus is also supported by ALBA
            cooperation funds. And we are also talking about Zero Usury
            which is linked to credit, micro-credit for many women who
            were always excluded economically and socially.<br>
            <br>
            We're talking about more than 200,000 heads of household who
            have benefited directly from ALBA programmes through Zero
            Usury and the Productive Bonus, as it is commonly known.<br>
            <br>
            Public sector employees too have received a Solidarity Bonus
            that benefits over 160,000 heads of household.<br>
            <br>
            So we're talking about a very important quantity of
            resources aimed at improving the purchasing power of
            beneficiaries directly in the country. And what does that
            mean for the economy? It means that thanks to ALBA's private
            investment role the economy has grown more than we had
            reckoned, including during the IMF review.<br>
            <br>
            Because in 2010 it was said that the economy grew 3% and in
            fact it grew 4.5% because those producers financed by ALBA
            managed exports of US$256 million to Venezuela. And before
            how much were they exporting? Less than US$8 million. So
            really we are talking about a change in the economy. Exports
            have grown thanks to timely intervention in the country's
            finances, in finance for production. We're talking about
            more cattle for export, more coffee for export. We're
            talking about more exports of agricultural produce. In our
            country, who exports that? Small rural producers.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, here 2009 saw exports of a significant amount,
            around US$50 million, of beans for the first time not just
            to Venezuela but to Central America thanks to that timely
            finance of Bolivarian development cooperation via the
            programmes of ALBA-Caruna, ALBA programmes for small
            producers who had no access to the commercial banks.<br>
            <br>
            We're talking about a fundamental issue that has to do with
            the stability of energy prices. Right now we are funding
            every part of the economy related to energy. That is to say,
            the external shock&nbsp; of oil prices associated with
            energy have been absorbed thanks to funding from ALBA.<br>
            <br>
            That's why on the electricity bills from the electrical
            energy utility there's a section that indicates the ALBA
            funding component that has allowed the country to maintain
            economic stability and permitted growth. The country
            deserves to grow. ALBA supports economic growth and social
            justice, because not just growth is important but the
            correct distribution too. Who benefit from the ALBA
            projects? The country's most impoverished people.<br>
