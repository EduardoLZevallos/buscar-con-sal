<h3><em><strong>Comments by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,<br />
in the Midday Edition of Multinoticias Channel 4<br />
<br />
January 4th 2024</strong></em><br />
 </h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Good afternoon, Compañera. Here we are, greeting each other. Our Fraternal Embrace to all the Families of our Blessed Nicaragua, in Peace, in Peace, in Peace...! Our Nicaragua gives thanks to God for Concord and Common Good, that Concord and that Common Good on which we work on every day, with Love, Hope and Trust in our Heavenly Father.</span></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">I have received a Poem from the Writer, Brother Edwin Moncada, which I want to read because it is important to know how we share Thoughts, Reflections, Truths, Real Truths. It begins with a Psalm of David, which says: “For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee”; it is from a Psalm of David.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario102.jpg.html" width="400" /></p>

<p><br />
<em>"Walt Whitman made silence burn:<br />
'Don't let anyone take away your right to express yourself, which is almost a duty.'</em></p>

<p><em>And in life, faith or art, the norm<br />
is that individuals must respond<br />
for their actions before the law. So be it in Rome<br />
or Spain (yes, in the Spain of loving<br />
There are 33 priests, not of the beautiful, who appear<br />
in prison, and not by praying the Angelus at dawn),<br />
Either in the US or in Chile, and no one is “astonished”.</em></p>

<p><em>Ah, but if it's in Nicaragua...</em></p>

<p><em>Garments are torn apart.<br />
It always happens like this. Notorious or anonymous.<br />
With dogmas or pure phylacteries.<br />
Since the last<br />
Sanhedrin<br />
even the most incensed cluster<br />
scoundrel.</em></p>

<p><em>The first to rip off is the lie<br />
facing the Truth.<br />
The lie that has in the center of its sight<br />
anger and evil for<br />
everything inspired by the celestial Light.</em></p>

<p><em>False, there is no religious persecution.</em></p>

<p><em>If a priest is arrested, is for a reason.<br />
That is not religious persecution.</em></p>

<p><br />
<em>For centuries and for open coffers,<br />
they have believed themselves are above the laws,<br />
and some hierarchs<br />
even above the King of Kings.</em></p>

<p><em>If they capture<br />
a hammock weaver because of something,<br />
due to lack of sloop<br />
and luxurious life<br />
they will not bark<br />
they will not say:<br />
“There is persecution of precious craftsmanship.”</em></p>

<p><em>Weavers don't believe they are above<br />
anyone, not even below: they are workers,<br />
they do not ask for nor live on gifts.</em></p>

<p><em>That's why they weave<br />
hammocks, they do not attack<br />
the country we love.</em></p>

<p><em>If they put a doctor of the Republic<br />
in a prison for some reason:<br />
they do not say either:<br />
“There is persecution of medical sciences.”</em></p>

<p><em>A good doctor or a decent doctor,<br />
does not believe himself more than the patient,<br />
nor of the governing Constitution.<br />
They heal, and they really heal people.</em></p>

<p><em>Because they really assume<br />
the hippocratic oath<br />
in their personal and professional life.<br />
Ergo, they are neither hypocritical nor cynical.</em></p>

<p><em>If a guitarist<br />
goes to jail for some criminal act,<br />
no one says:<br />
“He harasses artists for no reason.”</em></p>

<p><em>Musicians don't feel they are in the heights.<br />
They relax themselves in the chords.<br />
His part is not with the roar or the bitterness.<br />
They were not born to make noise or disorder.<br />
His job is harmony that lasts.</em></p>

<p><em>If they put a teacher<br />
in prison for violating<br />
the law, they don't say that's why<br />
“we must escape from magisterial persecution.”</em></p>

<p><em>Teachers don't believe<br />
they are predestined of no sign<br />
to say Amen and say what Jerusalem<br />
heard from the Divine Rabbi:<br />
"Love each other; do good..."</em></p>

<p><em>That is why teachers give classes, to nurture good<br />
citizens, technicians, workers, doctors...,<br />
—and those who were born full of art—<br />
without post-truth 2.0, without disinformation<br />
newspapers or the massive corporate poison<br />
of media sludge.</em></p>

<p><em>We want Peace and Development, not hostility<br />
from those who hate who cries “Repent!”<br />
in order to rhythm their villainy with the doctrine<br />
of pity, there they go empty of love<br />
how dark they are in weaving a crown of thorns<br />
against the Great Homeland of the titan Dario.</em></p>

<p><em>Paranoia and more paranoia, just paranoia...<br />
And nothing, nothing, absolutely<br />
of Metanoia (*).</em></p>

<p><em>What Repentance means, it means beyond the obtuse, anachronistic, traditional mind, active in evil. Metanonia, which is before and after. Change of thought, direction, focus, perspective, meaning in Life. It encompasses leaving behind moral or spiritual collapse for a clean change of course.</em></p>

<p><em>Paranoia? No ! Metanonia, which is transcending? Not that ! It's paranoia. And never go back. Never descend. It is not an option, not for a Christian at lea</em>st.</p>

<p>This is how we feel, always capable of strengthening ourselves, of transcending, of learning, always with the humility of our human condition. It is in humility that we build. It is by recognizing the Great Power of God that we can build. It is not by feeling</p>

<p>or believing ourselves to be God, because we are not God. And we cannot consider ourselves more than God.</p>

<p>In this Plane of Life, it is up to us, Human Beings, to be humble and recognize that Great Power of God, transformative, evolutionary, that Great Power of God that illuminates us, to always grow, to always learn, to transcend.</p>

<p>Evil does not defeat Good. Love can do everything, and the Love of God can infinitely, powerfully and strongly do everything!</p>

<p>Compañer@s, today we are also with a lot of Good News... Good News, Good Days, Good Times, Thanks to God!</p>

<p>We are announcing that next Monday, the Ministry of Finance has informed Comandante Daniel that all Public Servants on the Tax Payroll will receive their salary on Monday, January 8, well, in order to compensate for the necessary expenses of the Christmas, New Year's, Holidays, and to always have in our houses, in our homes, for our Families, Our Bread of every day, that Bread that God blesses.</p>

And on February 6, the day that he passed to another Plane of Life, to Eternity, from where he illuminates us, like the Sun that does not decline; on the 6th in the City of León, we have Floral Offerings to the Great Darío, at the place where the remains of his physical body lay, because Dario is everywhere, in spiritual and cultural terms, in terms of our National Honor and Glory.<br />
We also celebrate Leonel Rugama, Poet, Guerrillero, who left us that undefeated phrase that marks us: “May your Mother surrender!” Nobody gives up here, and all those who wanted to use Rubén, all those who wanted to use Leonel, we already know where they are, we already know how they are, and we already know that here, in this Undefeated and Victorious Nicaragua, no one gives up. Honor and Glory to the Great Leonel Rugama!</p>

<p>ENACAL informs us we have one more Well on the Masaya Highway to improve the service to 15,000 more Sisters and Brothers, from here in Managua.</p>

<p>And we conclude with a Mourning Note, but also a Note of Hope for Eternal Life for us Believers. Compañero Róger Antonio Cajina Vásquez, 63 years old, died in Chiquilistagua. He was the General Secretary of the Unions of the Mayor's Office of Managua, of the Bismarck Martínez Municipal Confederation, and Secretary of the National Organization of UNE-FNT.</p>

<p>We want to give a Fraternal and Solidarity Hug to his wife Martha Faustina Ocampo, to his children, Dany Luis Cajina López, Ana Georgina Cajina López, María de los Ángeles Cajina López and Róger Antonio Cajina López. To all of them our Affection, our Recognition, and we know that they inherit, that they follow the Legacy of their father, Exemplary Militant of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, loyal to his People, to the Nicaraguan Families and to the Nicaraguan Workers until his last breath.</p>

<p>We say goodbye to Róger and tell him: Always Beyond! We are Together, We Continue Together, Working Together, as Beings on this Plane of Life, and as a Spirit that is always inspiring us and filling us with Strength.</p>

<p>Big Hugs to all Nicaraguan Families on this special day, a day to think big about everything we are, about the Real Truths, about the Force of Truth; to think Big and do Big, from the Infinite Truth that is Justice, that is Concord, and that is Love. We believe and are Beings of Struggle, of Strength and of Big Love.</p>

<p>Big Hugs, Compañer@s, from our Comandante Daniel. And Let's Go Forward, it is ours, of the People and Families of Good Will, who live and work honestly in this Nicaragua of so much Blessings, the Future is ours! Big hugs.</p>
