<h2><strong>No, you can't solve mental health problems by booking a flight, but getting some distance from your routine can give you some perspective.</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>When I went to Nicaragua in November, I’d just filed a piece about <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/medication-creativity-mental-health-stigma">medication and its effect</a> on creativity. Writing that very piece helped me realize I was actually deeper in the well of my own depression than I’d been in ages, and would need to start actively trying to climb out of it soon. I also figured that getting away for a minute couldn’t hurt.</strong></em></p>

<p><img height="275" src="https://media.allure.com/photos/5e3b007dd79a4d000866f583/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/spa.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="450" /></p>

<p>Packing to go somewhere warm during a New York winter when you have both <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/seasonal-affective-disorder-vs-depression">general depression and SAD</a> is almost like getting a shot of adrenaline. There’s just something therapeutic about throwing swimsuits, cut-off denim shorts, and tubes of sunscreen in a suitcase while you’re wearing thermals under your sweatpants and your radiator is clanging. It’s basically a special cheat code to level up your own mental health.</p>

<p>But if the notion that I could leave my depression stateside wasn’t flawed enough already, the concept of heading to Nicaragua to do so complicated things further. The country has been embroiled in political unrest since April of 2018. Since that time, there have been <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/world/americas/nicaragua-ortega-protests.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/world/americas/nicaragua-ortega-protests.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ongoing protests</a> in response to decisions made by the country’s president, Daniel Ortega. In fact, the UN has called for an end to “persistent repression of dissent” in the country. So, while I wanted to enjoy myself and learn about <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ranchosantana.com/&quot;}" href="https://ranchosantana.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rancho Santana</a>, the resort and spa I'd been invited to get a sneak peek of, I was skeptical.</p>

<p>The thing is, <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/what-is-wellness/what-is-wellness-tourism/&quot;}" href="https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/what-is-wellness/what-is-wellness-tourism/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wellness tourism</a> walks a fine line. Depending on the players and the model, engaging in it can be voyeuristic, exploitative, and downright harmful. However, at other times, it can also serve to feed local economies. I scoped out the resort I was booked for and boarded the plane, reserving judgment.</p>

<p><img height="275" src="https://media.allure.com/photos/5e3b002179354200099a5fa8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/butterfly.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="450" />On the day I left, I wore layers to accommodate for the temperature difference between my origin point and destination, and high in the air somewhere between my layover in Miami and Managua, Nicaragua, I peeled nearly all of them off. I also turned off Slack and Twitter notifications on my phone, and while waiting for transportation to the hotel in the sticky, 90-degree heat, I realized I could immediately breathe more easily, even in the humidity.</p>

<p>Soon, I was in a shuttle and on my way to the ranch, which is actually a resort and residential community on the Emerald Coast located about two hours from the Managua airport. I was there as a guest to try out its new spa, called The Spa in El Bosque, before it officially opened.</p>

<p>But other than getting a few massages and facials, my days there would be my own, and the other activities offered by the ranch, which included hiking, surfing lessons, sand-boarding, and horseback riding, were mine to choose from (or sit out altogether in favor of poolside — or beachside — sunning, eating, and reading). For the most part, I was game, and signed up for as many things as I could fit in to my schedule.</p>

<p>My first night there, relaxed by the sunset, a dip in the ocean, and a leisurely dinner with new friends (during which we ordered nearly everything on the menu, including ceviche, tostones, and fish tacos), I posted a <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/B43Q3KAhFhi/&quot;}" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B43Q3KAhFhi/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">photo set to Instagram</a> with the caption, “i found a cure for my SAD.” After feeling the warmth of the sun in my bones for the first time in a few months, I felt like I might only be half-joking.</p>

<p>The next day, I hit the ground running. I woke up at 7:30 and walked down to the beach, which was only a few steps from my room. After napping on the sand and reading for a bit, I went for my first scheduled activity, a guided hike on one of the property’s many trails. My guide took me from the Inn, where I was staying, past the organic farm and toward one of the property’s beaches. Along the way, he pointed out many of the plants and animals that are common to the area and he told me a bit about what it’s like to work for Rancho Santana, as well as the ethos of the owners, and much of what I learned quelled my initial worries.</p>

<p><img height="275" src="https://media.allure.com/photos/5e3affe5120de500086da85b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/spaview.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="450" />The ranch employs more than 700 people, at least 450 of which are from local communities. Those employees are provided with multiple housing options, health care, and educational and occupational training resources. Plus, there's a huge focus on sustainability, with organic gardens, a livestock farm, and orchards on site that all contribute to the food program for guests and staff.</p>

<p>Soon after my hike, I took a dip in the pool before heading to the spa for the first massage of my stay. I was scheduled for two massages and a facial, and welcomed all three treatments. While I firmly believe that self-care starts more from within and my own personal brand is more about therapy, personal reflection, and spending time with those who make me feel seen, I have a bad habit of <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/mental-health-anger-loneliness-depression-physical-health-effects">holding tension and stress</a> in my muscles, and getting it massaged and scrubbed out of me was just what I needed.</p>

<p>The spa was peaceful and quiet, and unlike the Inn and all the restaurants I’d been spending time at during my stay at the ranch, was set back from the beach. It overlooked a lush forest, and as I sat on a hammock in a robe while waiting for my treatment, a calm I hadn’t felt in a while set in. The calm continued throughout my massage, and I walked back to my room feeling blissful and light.</p>

<p>Throughout my trip, I tried a few things I’ve never done before. I surfed for the first time (though perhaps it’s more accurate to say “I fell off a surfboard a lot for the first time”). I woke up really early every day without having a reason. I took a nap on the <a class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/B5BgMVghBzu/&quot;}" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5BgMVghBzu/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">front of a boat</a>. I left my phone in my room. And I also cried a lot, surprisingly. However, it wasn’t <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/ketamine-therapy-depression-treatment-results">my depression</a>, or at least not the usual manifestation of it.</p>

</aside>

<p>I wasn’t crying for my typical reasons, this time — the tears weren’t flowing because I was feeling overwhelmingly sad that I found myself bursting into tears. I was crying because I had more space than usual to feel the feelings that had been building up for a while, and honestly, I was a little pissed — at least at first.</p>

<p>Rather than the distraction I had hoped for, what I got instead was just enough time and distance from my usual routine to examine some things that weren’t working for me, and it was a bit glaring. It also made me feel like a complete idiot that I (a wellness editor!) had thought even for a moment that I could fly away from <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/talking-suicidal-ideation-therapist-family-friends">my depression</a>.</p>

<p>The thing is, it’s simply impossible to completely ignore what’s all around you forever, because it’s going to come out at some point. However, with enough perspective, you can sort out the difference between how you actually feel and how you <em>want</em> to feel, and come up with some proactive strategies that might help you bridge the gap.</p>

<p>While it’s perhaps a bit naive to believe that a single trip can completely change the way you do things — for example, a few days away from my typical life did not turn me into a morning person — it can shed some light on the behaviors that are no longer serving you.</p>

<p>Since I’ve returned home, I’ve started pushing my morning alarm clock back about 10 minutes every week or so to try and acclimate myself to an earlier start time, because I want to be someone who has a morning routine that’s less chaotic and more intentional. Now, I also keep a journal that’s separate from my work notebook and solely for noting what I’m feeling, so I can look back and make connections between events and emotions. I’m also trying to be easier on myself, even when I don’t live up to the high expectations I set. And while depression will always be a part of my life, and there’s no way to truly escape it, I now understand that looking at my mental health — <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/coming-out-process-physical-mental-pain-relief">and myself</a> — from a completely different angle is sometimes necessary.</p>
