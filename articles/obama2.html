<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Isolated and discredited 2 - the US in Latin America</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">by toni solo, July 14th 2009</span><br><br>With
the latest murders there, Honduras seems to be lunging backwards into a
death-squad-dark remake of John Negroponte's early 1980s dirty war in
that country. From Nicaragua's capital, Managua, Negroponte's fellow
National Security State promoter, Robert Callahan, looks on. With the
30th anniversary of the Sandinista Popular Revolution on July 19th,
this is a good moment for taking stock.<br><br>The current situation in Honduras<br><br>Over
the weekend in Honduras two local leaders of the left-wing Unificación
Democrática political party were murdered in circumstances reminiscent
of that 1980s Honduran dirty war. The coup regime expelled two teams of
Venezuelan journalists on Sunday, meaning no international media remain
there committed to ensuring fair coverage of resistance to the coup.
Only a few independent radio stations transmit reliable information on
resistance to the coup in Honduras &#8211; Radio Globo, Radio Progreso and
Radio Es-lo-de-menos. All the main media
stations belong to backers of the de facto usurper regime. The Canal 11
television channel, owned by business magnate Jaime Rosenthal has taken
a Pontius Pilate style stance of studied neutrality.<br><br>Both
Radio Globo and Radio Progreso were briefly taken off the air by the
army shortly after the coup. Despite continuing intimidation, they
continue to broadcast. Likewise, the Libertador alternative newspaper
has been under constant intimidating surveillance. Its editor Jhonny
José Lagos is under constant threat of detention. The coup regime
lifted the nightly curfew last weekend, after two weeks,&nbsp;but the
state of emergency suspension of basic rights remains in place. So the
army and police can do what they like, abusing due process, free of
effective legal restraint.<br><br>The Committee for the Defence of
Human Rights in Honduras reports at least 400 people still detained.
The two murders on Saturday night bring the total number of people
killed by the armed forces to 5, including the cold-blooded murder of
19 year old Isis Obed Murillo. Murillo's father is an environmental
activist from the conflictive Honduran department of Olancho. After
publicly denouncing his son's murder, he was arrested on trumped up
charges and spirited off to prison in Olancho.<br><br>While the curfew
has been officially lifted, people continue to be arbitrarily detained
by the army. Virtually no information is available of the large numbers
of youths and boys forcibly recruited by the army in poor urban barrios
and rural areas following the coup. Various municipal leaders in places
like Concepción del Norte and Trinidad in the Santa Barbara area, or
Tocoa in the Atlantida department seem to be incommunicado, either
detained or in hiding, as is, reportedly, the mayor of San Pedro Sula,
Honduras' second city.<br><br>The popular movement&nbsp;has organized
nationwide actions and protests under the leadership of trades unions,
grass roots community organizations, rural workers and public workers
organizations. The public school system remains shut down with teachers
on strike. One tactic of the national protests is to block vital
arterial roads for hours at a time so as to disrupt commercial
activity, keeping up the economic pressure on the business and
landowning oligarchy who staged the coup.<br><br>The
coup leaders
ambushed and expelled President Manuel Zelaya at gunpoint&nbsp;in
order, they said, to save the Constitution. For a third week now, they
are suppressing the very Constitution they&nbsp;vowed to protect. Radio
Globo&nbsp;has reported that coup-monger Roberto Carmona, involved in
the Venezuelan coup led by his namesake Pedro the Brief (1), was
detected sneaking in
and out of meetings in Tegucigalpa under the name of Armando
Valladares. Notorious former death squad leader Billy Joya has been
named presidential adviser to usurper-in-chief Roberto Micheletti.<br><br>US regional diplomacy<br><br>That
is the panorama now in John Negroponte's former 1980s death squad
stomping ground. Condoleezza Rica, Negroponte and their Bush regime
cronies did not send a leading accomplice of theirs like Robert J.
Callahan as ambassador to Managua on a careless whim. Nor does he
remain there as Obama's ambassador out of sheer inertia. Callahan is
a wartime consiglieri sent to replace teddy-bear Paul Trivelli in Managua
the better to destabilize the country's Sandinista-led government. If one looks at
the curriculum vitae of the US ambassadors in the region, they have all
at some time finished a course of study in one or other of the US
military academies.<br><br>The State Department biography of Callahan
tells us that he taught for 2 years at the National War College in
Washington D.C. If one looks at the biography of Hugo Llorens, US
ambassador to Honduras, one finds he received his Master of Science in
National Security Studies from the National War College in 1997. As a
footnote one might note with interest that Llorens joined the US
foreign service from Chase Manhattan bank. Stephen McFarland, US
ambassador to Guatemala is a graduate of the US Air War College. <br><br>Temporarily,
heading the US embassy in El Salvador at the moment is Robert Blau as
Charge d'Affaires. His State Department biography tells us &#8220;he was
previously the Deputy Director for Cuban Affairs in the U.S. Department
of State&#8217;s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, following a two-year
assignment at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana as Counselor for
Political and Economic Affairs. In that position he won the
Department&#8217;s James Clement Dunn Award for Excellence, based on his
support for the Cuban democratic opposition.&#8221;<br><br>In every country
in the region, the US government has placed very senior, very
experienced, deeply ideologically motivated diplomatic clones. Every
one of them has a thorough grounding in destabilization. None of this
is new and is common knowledge in Latin America. <br><br>The people
Obama relies on for advice on foreign policy in Latin America are in
the same mould. Council for Foreign Relations member Arturo Valenzuela
was Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs
and Senior Director for Inter-American Affairs at the National Security
Council during Bill Clinton's second presidential term. Dan Restrepo, a
key adviser to Obama on policy in Latin America has been Director of
Project of the Americas, a programme of the imperial propaganda and
policy mass-production dream factory, the Center for American Progress.
<br><br>A visit to their web site reveals yet another robot virtual
reality production line, spewing out the varieties of disingenuous,
vapid, fake, self-serving analysis that have become a hallmark of the
higher echelons of mainstream US intellectual life &#8211; right up to Barack
Obama. This is the same intellectual class that so aggressively sang
the praises of their consumer capitalist system, currently suffering the most
spectacular crash in over seventy years. Now that imperial decline is
bearing unmistakably down on the swarm of individuals that make up this
pullulating class of phonies, conciliation and dialogue have become
their superficial watchwords. <br><br>But no matter how hard they try
on the masks of agreeableness, their arrogance, hubris and infatuation
with US military power seep out all over the place. Barack Obama's
aspiration to reclaim US leadership in Latin America means not just
maintaining US military presence in the region but boosting it. For
example, in Colombia the US is currently negotiating not just one but five
extra military bases. <br><br>Policy continuity to believe in<br><br>The
Honduran coup makes very clear that six months into the first Obama
presidency, the pattern of US government regional destabilization,
self-evident under the Bush regime in 2008, continues as viciously as
before, though perhaps with more sophisticated deniability. As a
candidate, the Obama brand sales pitch was that under his presidency the
US would reclaim leadership in Latin America. <br><br>That snowball
lasted just a couple of microseconds into the infernal Honduran coup.
In fact, it has been the ALBA countries led by Venezuela, Cuba and
Nicaragua that have made the running. Their prompt determined response
made Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama look even more like double
talking frauds than they would have done otherwise. <br><br>The US
government continues to deal in propaganda rather than facts. Its
policy in Latin America is based on a virtual reality confection -
mechanically reproduced innumerable times over by the corporate media -
that the United States government is committed to promoting democracy.
If one escapes from this through-the-looking-glass State Department
propaganda even for a moment, one finds that its&#8220;democracy promotion&#8221;
policy persistently uses the tools of neocolonialist intervention to
nourish anti-democratic forces almost everywhere in Latin America. <br><br>That
is true in the case of the murderous separatists in Bolivia, the
embittered oligarchs in Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru and too of their
coup-mongering counterparts in Central America. In Colombia and Mexico,
US military aid props up hopelessly corrupt regimes committed to
vicious wholesale repression against indigenous peoples, human rights
activists, trades unionists and community leaders. The credibility gap
of the United States among the great majority of people in Latin
America is almost unbridgeable.<br><br>The twin assertion accompanying
fake US &#8220;democracy promotion&#8221; is its grifting twin, the pernicious myth
of free market economic prosperity. The irrefutable reality now is that
unregulated corporate monopoly capitalism has destroyed the US economy,
creating mass unemployment and&nbsp; recalcitrant stagnation likely to
last perhaps a decade or more. The very same intellectual class that
oversaw that debacle are still, even now in the middle of their
comprehensive systemic failure,&nbsp;vociferously proclaiming the
wondrous benefits of free market prosperity to Latin America.<br><br>The
counterfactual corollary of the manifestly absurd idea that the United
States promotes democracy and economic prosperity in Latin America is
that its antagonists, like Venezuela, must do the opposite. Venezuela
and its allies are therefore cast as malevolent, comically inept
adversaries deliberately acting to deny freedom and prosperity to the
region's peoples. The most cursory look at the record speaks otherwise.<br><br>Decades
of credit and aid channelled by the US and its allies to the region
completely failed to provide energy and food security, significantly
reduce illiteracy, provide adequate health care or radically improve
access to credit for the excluded majority. Since 2004 it has been
Venezuela and Cuba and their allies that have made a dramatic
difference in all those areas. UNESCO confirmed last month that
illiteracy has been eradicated in Nicaragua, for example. But still,
disingenuous frauds like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Dan Restrepo,
Thomas Shannon, and Arturo Valenzuela repeat their completely
implausible propaganda. <br><br>As a political class, their peers on
the domestic economy have betrayed the well-being of the people of the
United States for many years ahead. That political class and its
representatives are just as false and crooked on foreign policy. Just
about wherever they turn, they get things hopelessly wrong by sticking
obtusely to discredited, patently counterfactual premises. In Latin
America, those premises are definitively falsified, exposed as
nonsense, by the adhesion of 20 countries with over 110 million people
to Venezuelan-driven economic initiatives like Petrocaribe and ALBA.<br><br>As
for the North American and European neocolonialist Left, on Nicaragua
and on Iran they repeated the false imperialist line, insisting on
spurious allegations of massive electoral fraud. On Honduras, they have
dropped the issue almost as quickly as the mainstream corporate media
has done. In practice, at a fundamental level, they are almost
completely irrelevant to the efforts of the impoverished majority in
Latin America&nbsp; to achieve decisive change.<br><br>Central America - fitting up the facts<br><br>Many
writers have noted the damning contrast between the media-political
outrage about the young Iranian woman murdered in Teheran and the
almost total indifference to the murder of Isis Obed Murillo in
Tegucigalpa. One might also contrast coverage of human rights abuses in
Iran and&nbsp;the long term non-reporting of security force-related
murders and violations in Colombia or Mexico. For many people in Latin
America, the juxtaposition of the events in Iran with those in Honduras
has been compelling &#8211; and entirely unfavourable both to the United
States government and the corporate media in general. CNN's abysmally
partisan reporting on Honduras seems to have been truly eye-opening for
large numbers of previously relatively uncritical viewers in Latin
America.<br><br>Across the political spectrum in the Western Bloc
countries of the United States and its allies, comment and analysis
turned mainly around two non sequiturs that defined coverage of the
coup in terms imposed by the coup regime's powerful supporters.
Firstly, almost all writers persistently referred to Manuel Zelaya as a
&#8220;leftist&#8221;. Secondly, they all insisted on the non-issue of re-election
as some kind of explanation for the coup.<br><br>Manuel Zelaya has
never talked about nationalizing the means of production in Honduras.
It is an extremely tendentious stretch of the imagination to describe
him as a socialist. So what do those descriptions of him as a &#8220;leftist&#8221;
refer to? When Manuel Zelaya sought help in Washington to ease the
energy and food security problems his government faced, he was rebuffed
by the United States government. His case presents yet one more example
of counter-productive United States foreign policy using a
self-exculpatory cliché to justify categorical failure.<br><br>Zelaya's
public policy trajectory, ever since his time as a government
functionary coordinating post-Hurricane Mitch reconstruction, has been
one of trying to improve conditions for his country's impoverished
majority. His case shows we have reached a point where a broad spectrum
of opinion from right to left, glibly defines decisive action to reduce
poverty as being &#8220;leftist&#8221;. Delivering basic rights to health care and
education is now &#8220;leftist&#8221;. <br><br>Ensuring access for the
impoverished majority to affordable credit is now &#8220;leftist&#8221;. Worrying
about how to stimulate small and medium scale agricultural production
is &#8220;leftist&#8221;. Guaranteeing food and energy security is &#8220;leftist&#8221;. But
not one of those policies would look out of place anywhere in currently
dominant public policy in North America or Western Europe.<br><br>The
kind of logic that considers such unhelpful use of &#8220;leftist&#8221; as an
adjective applicable to someone like Manuel Zelaya hollows out words,
turning them into meaningless shells. Users of those shells &#8211; like
Barack Obama - shuffle them around the screen to confuse the onlooking
public. Such corrupt use of language narrows possibilities of
understanding down to the blinkered avenues so carefully, neatly and
deceitfully laid out by shifty corporate media propaganda originators
like the Center for American Progress. <br><br>Despite the kind of
euphoric rhetoric Zelaya may occasionally use to encourage or perhaps
seduce parts of his national audience, in practice his decisions have
been those of a nationalist centrist-perhaps-social-democrat very much
in the mould of Ramon Villeda Morales, another reforming Honduran
president overthrown by a military coup in 1963. Framing Zelaya more
fully in a perspective that includes his own political biography as
well as relevant history from the last fifty years makes &#8220;leftist&#8221;,
when applied to him, look like the cheap disposable tag it&nbsp;is.<br><br>Likewise,
the issue of re-election has always been a complete non sequitur.&nbsp;
If Zelaya wanted to run for re-election the earliest he could possibly
do so would be 2013, even if a Constituent Assembly were to take place and even if it accepted presidential re-election.
But still, writers across the political spectrum insisted on treating
the re-election issue as if it were highly relevant to the coup in some
sense other than as a baseless pretext. It was the combination of
&#8220;leftist seeks re-election&#8221; that allowed the corporate media to play
down the viciousness of the decisive rupture of democratic norms in
Honduras that has so shocked most of Latin America. The Honduran coup
instigators condemned a non-binding consultative vote&nbsp;as
undemocratic - quite&nbsp;stunning nonsense.<br><br>The Obama
administration was left behind by that broad continental reaction for
the fundamental reason that they do, after all, support the aims of the
coup leaders. Those aims are several and interlocking. One is to
prevent democratic participation by the impoverished majority in
decisions that affect their chances of a decent life for themselves and
their families. <br><br>Such participation would end the corrupt
oligarchic elite's feudal&nbsp; stranglehold on the country's
resources, enabling a decisive redistribution in favour of the
majority. Another aim is to defend United States domination and
military occupation of Honduras which is wholly concomitant to the
seigneurial grip on political power of the country's tyrannical
oligarchy. Self-evidently, those aims have absolutely nothing to do
with &#8220;promoting democracy&#8221;.<br><br>Ends unknown in their beginning <br><br>Last
night, Manuel Zelaya gave the coup-leaders an ultimatum, effectively
calling the Obama administration's bluff on the farcical dialogue
mediated by President Oscar Arias in Costa Rica. Sunday July 19th in
Managua should see what for Central America may well be truly momentous
declarations. As Fidel Castro wrote in the title of his recent analysis
of events in Honduras &#8211; either the coup dies or Constitutions do. Why
bother holding elections if governments can be elected de facto by a
country's legislature?<br><br>From start to still undecided finish, the
coup in Honduras has proven to be a defining moment in the historical
development of the Americas. The United States government's slow, tepid
condemnation of the coup barely masks its support for the coup leaders'
aims. It has been the ALBA governments that have galvanized the
region's governments to act against the coup regime. Inside Honduras,
the coup has stirred nationwide resistance unknown since the great
strike of 1954. Whatever the outcome, on current form the United States
is now likely to be left even more isolated and discredited in the
region than it was under George W. Bush.<br><br>Note<br>1.
Thanks to those who corrected the origianl assertion in this article
that Roberto Carmona was the brother of Pedro Carmona. I picked up that
error from a radio broadcast and&nbsp;assumed it must be so without
checking it, which I should have done.
