of Comandante Carlos Fonseca Amador</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm"><b>November 8th 2024</b></p>

<div class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="460"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="252" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q03zoiV0oYU" width="448"></iframe></div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm"><b>Address by Daniel</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters; Families of this Land of Heroes and Martyrs, Heroes and Martyrs in defense of these Lands, defending Sovereignty, Self-Determination, defending Independence.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">We salute all our Brothers and Sisters who are working at this hour, carrying out their work, the Soldiers who are deployed all over our Territory, others sailing to protect our Territorial Seas, both in the Pacific and the Caribbean; to all the Police Officers also protecting Security and Peace out on the streets, in the neighborhoods, in the districts, in the communities. For what? So that all those working in Hospitals right now can do so, and we salute them too, the doctors, nurses, nursing assistants who are attending to Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers who arrive in emergency, who arrive seeking consultation at all hours and are treated with all the Fraternity, Love and Affection of doctors and nurses, who know how to ensure Solidarity and Affection for the Patients they serve.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Likewise, to greet those working on construction sites, building homes in different parts of our country; those who maintain the bridges and also are reinforcing the bridges that have been affected by the torrential rains, that is say, protecting Life, Security, such that, thanks be to God, we have not had the very serious disasters we have seen in other Countries, unfortunately, where there have been hundreds of people and in other cases thousands of people affected by heavy rains, the rains that are so badly needed to ensure the harvest of corn, beans, coffee, basic foods in our countries, wheat in other regions of the World.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And when we encounter torrential rains, such as those that have been flooding different areas of the world, as well as hurricanes, thus our Solidarity with the Heroic People of Cuba who are resisting the onslaughts of hurricanes, the Blockade for more than 60 years, and they have also suffered two hurricanes in this period hitting Cuba, including Havana. Our solidarity with those People of Martí, of Fidel, of Raúl, of Díaz-Canel.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Beloved Nicaraguan Families, beloved Brothers and Sisters, beloved Young People, today we are paying tribute to Comandante Carlos, Tayacan Victorious over Death, so well said and very well merited. And here we are presiding with Compañera Rosario, Vice President of the Republic; with Compañero Gustavo Porras, President of the National Assembly; with Army General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Commander-in-Chief of the Army; with Major General Bayardo Rodríguez, Chief of the Army General Staff; with Major General Marvin Elías Corrales, Inspector General of the Army.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Also with the First Commissioner Francisco Javier Díaz, Director General of the National Police; with the Commissioner General Horacio Rocha, Minister Advisor; with Commissioner General Zhukov Serrano, Deputy Director of the National Police.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">With our beloved Brother, Comandante Lumberto Campbell, Secretary of the Presidency for the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, the Coast that thunders with the Strength of the Original Peoples, the Miskitos, the Sumos, the Ramas, the Garifuna, and all those also of African descent, who populate the Caribbean Coast.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And really, Lumberto represents us very well, and these are moments when we are holding high the Blue and White Flag supported by the Red and Black Flag, via the highways that connect the Pacific with the Caribbean, the highways are there and the gigantic bridges which now cross those rivers that before could not be crossed with vehicles, only by boats, in barges where the vehicles had to be mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Those roads are multiplying and that means Progress, Well-being, Security, Education, Health, all of which are also multiplying on the Caribbean Coast, both in the North and in the South, Hospitals, and Basic, Higher and University Education Centers.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">That is to say, it is Carlos bringing that Light, bringing that Well-being to Nicaraguan Families throughout the country.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">We are also accompanied by the Compañera Minister of the Interior, Amelia Coronel; the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Commissioner General Luis Cañas; the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Compañera Carla Eugenia Salinas García.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And too, Fidel Moreno joins us, our Compañero who is always present in multiple activities, bearing the name of Comandante Fidel, and he lives up to that name with his work, with his dedication; and of course, as Secretary of Organization of the Sandinista Front.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/409010.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">In the month of November 1957, precisely on a day like yesterday, November 7th, our Brother Carlos was attending the 40th Anniversary of the Triumph of the October Revolution in Moscow.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Carlos was a boy, a young man, and in fact, he was delegated by the Youth of the Socialist Party to participate in that Event, and there now that path continues, it opened the way for the Russian Federation to give the Battle for Peace, the Russian Federation, led by President Putin, in Solidarity with Humanity, since the Battle the Russian Federation is waging against Fascism is the same Battle that the Soviet Union waged against Fascism. And they defeated Hitler there, and here they are going to overcome as well, they are defeating the Hitler that the Imperialists of the Earth have made there.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">After that journey to Moscow, then on November 7th 1970, Carlos signed a Document circulated clandestinely, entitled "Message to the Nicaraguan People”, where he warns, Carlos made that warning, that the traitors to the Nation will be definitively defeated. So it has been and so it will be. That was in 1970.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">On November 7th 1976, Carlos, with his heavy glasses, because he had a very strong myopia and so naturally, it was difficult for him to see, but he had decided, for the sake of Unity in the Sandinista Front, to come from Cuba and take the lead for a meeting that we would hold in the mountains.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">We were summoned, and in fact, Carlos was making his way through the Iyas region at that time, accompanied by Claudia Chamorro, Comandante Francisco Rivera “El Zorro”. Then the Compañer@s, La Claudia, "El Zorro” and another Compañero went another way so as to facilitate Carlos' departure. That was in the year 1976, in the month of November.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And that November 7th, in the middle of the night, Compañero Comandante Eduardo Contreras, who had been leader of the Commando that freed those of us who had then been imprisoned for a little more than 7 years, from prison.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Back then we had met with Carlos there in Cuba and we had made the decision for him to come to Nicaragua and go ahead with that meeting; meanwhile, here making contact with some Compañeras and Compañeros while waiting for the signal to set out to the meeting as well.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And our Brother Eduardo Contreras, Marcos was his pseudonym, or Comandante Cero, he was the first Comandante Cero, Marcos, a member of the Directorate, was ambushed by the National Guard, they managed to overcome him, they managed to neutralize him.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">They were in a neighborhood here in Managua and he had gone out to make contacts there with other Compañeras and Compañeros, and at that point they were ambushed in the Residencial Asososca and they gave their lives there for the Unity of the Front, of the Nicaraguan People, Eduardo Contreras, Rogelio Picado and Silvio Reñazco, three Sandinista Brothers. They fell on November 7th 1976, meanwhile Carlos was already under pressure by the National Guard patrols there in Iyas.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">On that same November 7th, in the El Dorado neighborhood, here in Managua, the house where Compañero Carlos Roberto Huembes, an alternate member of the National Directorate of the Sandinista Front, was staying was raided and he was assassinated.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Likewise, there in Zinica where they were already closing in on Carlos, the Comrades José Benito Núñez Ortiz, Terencio de Jesús Sánchez, Juan José Álvarez Berríos, were killed in action in the community of Zinica in Waslala. These Compañeros were originally from the heroic neighborhood of Sutiaba, in León, and were there fighting with the Sandinista Front.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">On November 7th, 1986, Compañero Alfonso Núñez Rodríguez was assassinated in the municipality of Comalapa, department of Chontales, where he was originally from; brother of the Historic Combatant Daniel Núñez, leader of the UNAG.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">On November 7th 1987, Compañero Pablo Avelino Mina Reyes, originally from the municipality of Villa Sandino in the department of Chontales, was killed in action.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">As we can see from all this, the struggle was being fought in different parts of our country.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And in 1988, as I said in 1987 Pablo Avelino Mina Reyes was killed in action, originally from the municipality of Villa Sandino, department of Chontales, and on November 7th 1988, Compañero Felix Pedro Pichardo Narváez fell, in the Kisilaya Community, in the municipality of Zelaya Central; he was originally from the Los Zarzales area of the El Jicaral municipality, in Nueva Segovia.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">We are talking about a sample, this is just a sample of the number of Heroes and Martyrs who fell throughout the Revolutionary Struggle.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">On November 8th, it's important to note, November 8th is the date on which Carlos ascended in his Transit towards Immortality, and on November 8th, 1945, the National Hero Gaspar García Laviana was born in San Martín del Rey Aurelio, in Asturias, Spain.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Carlos was about to transition to Immortality, just when Gaspar was born, a tender child there, how could his parents imagine, or how could we imagine that then Gaspar would come here to Nicaragua and become a Priest committed to Christ, committed to the Poor, committed to the Peasants, giving his life in the Struggle for Freedom.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Then too, we have here the list of Fallen Compañeros and Compañeras, after all, who were then killed in the war imposed on us by the Yankee Empire with Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">In 1984, Compañero Leonardo Salvador Marenco, from the community of Wanawás, in Río Blanco, Matagalpa, was killed in action and he was originally from Managua.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">In 1987, Compañero Noel Antonio Zeledón Huete was killed in action in the Community of La Patriota, in the municipality of Matiguás. This Brother was originally from the municipality of Esquipulas.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">In 1979 Compañero Jorge Montealegre was assassinated, he was the person responsible for the National Land Reform Institute in the north of the Country, and there he was assassinated.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">So then, and as we were saying on November 8th 1976, 48 years ago today, Carlos gave up his life, but he also gave his Word, he gave his Ideology, he gave his Example, which was inherited by the Sandinista National Liberation Front leading it to achieve Victory on July 19th 1979.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Today we tell Carlos that we remain in the Struggle, that we are still in the Battle, and we are continuing to build, above all, and we are building, because we have been able to defend Peace, we know how to defend Peace. And with Peace comes Security, and when there is Peace and Security, then there is Well-being for all Nicaraguans.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And that is the Way, that is the Route, as the song goes: “Traveler, there is no Way, you make the Way as you Go,” and Carlos opened up a huge Path for the Nicaraguan People. So here we are, Carlos, opening New Paths for the Benefit of the Nicaraguan People, Making Our Way as we Go, All of Us Together, all with the same Strength, all with the same Morale, with the same Firmness, with all the Spirit of Loyalty to Carlos, and to the Sandinista National Liberation Front.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Sandino Lives On, the Struggle Goes On!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Carlos Fonseca Lives On, and the Struggle Goes On!<br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm"><b>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the Central Act in Commemoration of the 48th Anniversary<br />
of the Transition to Immortality of Comandante Carlos Fonseca Amador</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm"><b>November 8th 2024</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Good afternoon, beloved Families of this Blessed Nicaragua. This is a Blessed Day, when our Hearts fill with Pride and National Dignity, because we are not only the Children of Sandino, Zeledón, Andrés, but also of Carlos Fonseca, who met his death but is one of those who never Die.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">So much so that we learned to admire Carlos, in the Hardest Sowing Season, as Leonel Rugama put it. Admired, respected, recognized, listened to and followed by so many Nicaraguans who have had faith in Revolutionary Commitment. Days, nights, Times, Times of Life and Hope for those who have dedicated themselves to the Revolution... Times of Certainty that must be built on absolute dedication to the Struggle. So many ways to fight, so many ways to achieve victories... Fighting to overcome!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">He taught us. He never left us. For Carlos is not only the Hero, the Comandante, the Founder, he is our Heritage, the National Heritage of this our Nicaragua, and we say this with so much Love, Recognition, Respect, Admiration.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Carlos is here, along all the Paths we travel, which are Paths of Struggles and Victories, because Life is a Struggle, it is a Daily Combat, even with ourselves, as Human Beings, who must learn to do what we think is the most correct thing. We human beings live with that struggle there, inside of us. Life is Struggle and Life is Learning, and Life brings daily Lessons which we hope we can always learn, so as to continue making our way.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">Carlos is the Revolution, Carlos is the Sandinista Front, Carlos is the Mystique, he is the Ideology, Carlos is the Historical Memory, and Carlos is the Future of this People of ours, one which has to be a Future of Well-being, of more Rights, overcoming all Poverty and all Precariousness, because also there is also poverty of Soul.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And when Carlos talks about Traitors to the Nation, he is talking about Poverty and Precariousness of Soul too; because with a Great Soul, with Spirit, with Faith, imitating Christ, we give ourselves, and we continue to give ourselves to build, not to destroy, to love, never to hate, and to be and do the best possible every day, to bring about the Future that the Heroic, Great, Impressive, Courageous, Victorious People of Nicaragua deserve, one we all deserve.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">And also to fight in harmony with the Great Causes of Humanity, to fight for Peace in the World, to fight for Justice in the World, to fight for Respect for National Sovereignty around the World, to fight for the Dignity of all Peoples. And to fight Together, because it is Together that We Go Onward.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.3cm">So a Warm Embrace on this Weekend, and we know that every Weekend, since we have Peace, Thanks be to God, we can celebrate Life in a big way, assured, certain, that we are moving onward and that we are creating the Future. Thank you, Compañeras and Comapñeros.</p>
