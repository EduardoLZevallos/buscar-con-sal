<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Like other countries Nicaragua election law requires political parties to meet certain benchmarks in order to get on the ballot. In general, it’s a lower bar than the U.S. sets for third parties or for write-in candidates. Having said that one party which failed to meet the criteria (and not for the first time) claim to have been excluded from the elections. The MRS (</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Movimiento Renovador Sandinista</font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">) which back in January changed its name to UNAMOS (</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Unión Democrática Renovadora)</font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> is comprised largely of Nicaragua’s cultural elite; Sergio Ramirez, Gioconda Belli, Carlos Fernando Chamoro, Felix Maradiaga, Oscar Renee Vargas, Dora Maria Tellez, Sophia Montenegro, Azalea Solis, Vilma </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Núñez</font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> and others. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>The Country Under My Skin</i></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> Gioconda Belli recorded her experience of the years leading up to the overthrow of the Somoza regime. During the 1970’s she worked as a courier for the Sandinistas, clandestinely delivering plans, letters and other documents for the revolutionary cause. At one point in the memoir she was in Cuba at a formal dinner attended by Fidel Castro. She flushed at the thought that Castro was flirting with her, but when he pulled her aside to speak he said, “Daniel Ortega, he’s the one.”</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Like Gioconda Belli, a good number of the former MRS members took part in the revolution and since the 1990’s have distanced themselves from Daniel Ortega. During those same years they became very active in the NGO sector and are based largely in the capital city. Although this group has little support outside of Managua, they have tremendous reach internationally because they tend to speak English or were educated in the United States and because of the relationships they forged in the 1980s when large numbers of international solidarity workers came to Nicaragua to take part in the socialist experiment. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Since Daniel Ortega’s victory in the 2006 elections, for those former Sandinistas, it has been a case of sour grapes. Over the course of the past decade or so they have increasingly moved to the political right, forming alliances with the oligarchs of old and accepting large amounts of money from the United States through the National Endowment for Democracy and USAID. But to a large extent those individuals descended from the upper-classes, so really, the rift is not all that surprising. According to Nils McCune, an agronomist with a PhD who has deep ties to Nicaragua, during that same period Daniel Orgeta remained on the ground helping regular working-class Nicaraguans to defend the gains made during the 1980’s, including the land reform. For that reason the Sandinista base continued to hover at about 32%.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Not long ago, William Robinson, a professor at UC Santa Barbara, falsely claimed that the biggest beneficiary of U.S. funding was the Nicaraguan government itself. The assertion is part of a left attack advanced by Robinson which rests upon the rather fabulous premise that the U.S. is actually well-disposed towards Nicaragua’s socialist government. Accepting Robinson’s claim one would have to forget former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s depiction of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua as a ‘Troika of Tyranny’ and dismiss the sudden rehabilitation of Eliot Abrams who championed the Contra War that resulted in the death of 30,000 Nicaraguans. One would have to overlook the extent to which the Biden administration, in foreign affairs at least, has opted for continuity with Trump era policies. But what is really staggering is the extent to which Robinson is willing to be completely dishonest in order to advance his claim that Nicaragua, the FSLN and Daniel Ortega have abandoned socialism. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Calibri, serif"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Funded by U.S. tax dollars, the NED and USAID operate with some level of transparency and anyone with a computer can verify the allocation of funds for themselves on their respective the websites. <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2021/06/01/cia-usaid-nicaragua-right-wing-media/">In this article</a> </font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Benjamin Norton shows the extent to which the U.S. has funded the adversaries of the FSLN government and large chunks from the NED and USAID websites are embedded into the text. The piece is an exhaustive inditement of U.S. funding for regime change objectives. </font></font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Before 2007 USAID funded projects such as infrastructure but when Ortega took office those allocations were immediately suspended and since that time the sole emphasis has been on ‘democracy building’ with funding going exclusively to adversaries of the present government. But Robinson needed to fudge the truth about the millions of dollars the U.S. has invested in destabilizing Nicaragua (over thirty million in 2020 alone) because he has aligned himself with an opposition that has benefited from U.S. largess and that within Nicaragua are widely recognized as the architects of the 2018 coup attempt. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">These adversaries including a number of former Sandinistas who belonged to the MRS (now UNAMOS</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">), </font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">have, since 2007, tenaciously sought to undermine the Ortega/Murillo government. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the government programs, not to mention the stellar handling of the Covid 19 pandemic, have made an electoral challenge an impossibility. Even if all of the opposition parties managed to coalesce under one umbrella, at most they might be expected to receive 25% of the vote. The problem is even worse for UNAMOS which as stated have little support outside of Managua and have never polled above 6%.</font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The article by Ben Norton linked to above shows the direct relationships between the U.S. funding of media sites like 100% Noticias that routinely employs fake news and that during the crisis of 2018 invoked calls for violence. Oscar Renee Vargas, for example, repeatedly appeared on the channel and called on protestors to go to the neighborhood of El Carmen and storm the presidential residence. Hundreds of people will die, Vargas admitted, but it’s what we need to do. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Astro turf has been the foundation of many an NGO in Nicaragua: an LGBT rights group, indigenous rights group, a peasant organization and fake environmental interests. Youth in Managua and in other cities were cultivated by media platforms and ‘democracy building’ classes taught by pro-U.S. pro-neoliberal professors like Felix Maradiaga. While all of those efforts combined received no more than a fraction of public support, they provided photo ops, a presence on social media and a barrage of anti-government messaging that would be used in the left attack; in other words, the appearance of civil society and marginalized groups at odds with a socialist government which claimed those very groups as part of its base.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Additional context may be helpful for understanding the present moment with</font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> respect to the new wave of anti-Orgeta propaganda, the legitimacy of the elections and the current investigations taking place within Nicaragua. The integrity of the 2021 elections was brought to the forefront months earlier when a leaked document outlined a second coup attempt scheduled to take place around the November 2021 elections. Jill Clark-Gollub of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) wrote: “</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The document even admits that the FSLN is likely to win in a fair election, in which case a “sudden, unanticipated transition” may be necessary. The planned subterfuge was called <a href="https://www.coha.org/the-us-contracts-out-its-regime-change-operation-in-nicaragua/ ">Responsive Assistance in Nicaragua or RAIN.</a>” </font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Investigations presently taking place within Nicaragua range widely from tax evasion and money laundering to violating the country’s Foreign Agents Law, (modeled after a similar law in the U.S. and passed in the Chamorro years) and a more recent law which is basically an anti-sedition law. </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The arrests have been characterized as a round-up of political opponents by Daniel Ortega prior to the election although none were actual candidates and claims of exclusion had to do with meeting those benchmark requirements in order to qualify as a political party. In the high-profile case of Christiana Chamorro, she was neither a candidate nor was any political party willing to adapt her to the position. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In retrospect, the arrest of Hugo Torrez who attempted to enter the country with a suitcase of undeclared currency is viewed as an intentional provocation. But it was the arrest of Christiana Chomorro that sparked outrage as the Chamorro clan for all of Nicaragua’s history has been the most powerful family in the county. Over seven past presidents, a media empire, luxury hotels and production plants that manufacture soaps and detergents, cooking oil and agricultural products; the Chamorros preside over an empire and are linked to the Lacayo clan through marriage. Both names appeared in the Panama Papers.</font></font><br />

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">As the president of the Violetta de Barrios Chamorro Foundation, Christiana Chamorro has received over seven million dollars in 2020 alone. Those funds were distributed to a range of other media organizations including the only significant print newspaper </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>La Prensa</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> of which she was Vice President. Allegedly some of the money also ended up in her personal bank account and there are questions about the money which continued to flow after the foundation closed its doors. International mainstream media have relied heavily on reports by </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>LaPrensa</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">—viciously anti-Sandinista as described by Ben Norton—and other Chamorro controlled entities for their own reporting.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">More recently COSEP president Michael Healy Lacayo was arrested and charged with money laundering and attempting to undermine the democratic process. COSEP stands for </font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">the Supreme Council of Private Companies and represents the private sector within Nicaragua but does not include small or family-owned businesses. </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Nicaraguan journalist William Grigsby of the popular show </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>Sin Fronteras</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> revealed that Healy as well as COSEP’s vice president have received monthly payments of eight thousand dollars from Washington based NGO, International Institute on Race, Equality and Human Rights. According to Grigsby Healy met with publicist María Fabiola Espinoza, in June about a disinformation and smear campaign to discredit the elections. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Within the United States mainstream media decried Russian interference in the presidential election of 2016. With obsession, American journalists pursued the Russiagate narrative at the expense of all else, but the claims proved to be largely exaggerated. In the case of Google, the amount of advertising purchased in rubles was a mere $4,000 and that money could not be directly tied to the Kremlin. Yet, Nicaraguans are expected to look the other way in the face of direct and substantial interference.</font></font></p>

Ohers presently facing legal problems have violated the terms of the amnesty which followed the political violence of 2018. Medardo Mairena participated in a massacre which took place in the small town of Morrito located in a very rural part of the country. <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/3672">The attack left four police officers</a> and a school teacher dead.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> Years before the coup attempt Mairena fled Costa Rica under the shadow of human trafficking allegations.

The government proposal raised the contribution of employers by 3% and that of employees by less than 1%. The five percent cut to existing pensions was a trade-off for expanded health services which the pension union had agreed to. But that was all reported incorrectly.

Although his focus is primarily with Argentina, Venezuela and Bolivia, one can see that progress in Nicaragua has followed a similar trajectory. After Ortega took office school fees were immediately dropped. The zero-hunger program was administered based on need and essential services like electricity and public transportation were subsidized. Despite Robinson’s derisive attitude of how benefits have been deployed, the reality is that if it were just a matter of winning popularity, of gaining votes, services would be concentrated in the urban areas or the in-between places where clusters of the population reside. But just the opposite has been the case. Basic services like electricity, roads, bridges and drinking water have been taken to the most remote areas of the country. </font></font></p>

If the claim by William Robinson that the role played by transnational capital is truly significant, that might be the very thing which could prevent Nicaragua from becoming another Venezuela. The last thing Nicaragua wants to see is another wave of job loss. In other words if AMCHAM (the American Chamber of Commerce) leadership are willing to recognize that the coup attempt was a gamble which did not pay off, those sectors may be content with the present state of general prosperity. But that alone will not guarantee an end to interference by Washington. If further subterfuge or sanctions are put into place, will the government move to advance the revolution through more extraordinary means? What Robinson fails to recognize are the contradictions which often exist between the interests of capital and U.S. geopolitical goals. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm; line-height: 150%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Another factor at work is the growing perception among the left in the U.S. that sanctions are ineffective and punitive.

I live in Granada where people are out celebrating four nights a week. The Calzada which is closed to traffic and where the tables and chairs of restaurants cover the street, is often as busy as it once was at the height of tourist season. The vast majority of Nicaraguans don’t give a toss about Stephen Kinzer, Paul Lafferty or William Robinson. They are not concerned about some article which appeared in the </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>New York Tims Review of Books</i></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">. The attitude is similar towards the propaganda produced by Univision or CNN Espanol. </font></font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Nils McCune often refers to ‘historical memory’ which I understand to mean the conscious recognition of past imperialism and how that effects the continued struggle for autonomy. Nicaraguans have transcended the influence and false reality created by the billionaire, capitalist class, not only in the media but also through international NGOs which enabled the myth that the government is authoritarian. In that sense they have freed themselves which leaves them able to think for themselves, understand their own experiences and make decisions which are, at least for now, unclouded by the shadow of the United States and all that has meant in the Southern Hemisphere. </font></font></p>
