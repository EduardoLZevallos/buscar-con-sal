<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Address by Daniel</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Nicaraguan brothers and sisters; families of this land of Heroes and Martyrs; of working men and women, of the city and the countryside; of a Youth growing in Education and with Education, from early childhood they are developing, childhood with education. And schools are multiplying throughout our country, for all ages.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Schools are multiplying throughout our country, so that our Youth who for centuries have been marginalized, young people who come from peasant families, are incorporated not only into Primary Education, or Secondary Education, but have access in these times to Technical Careers, Science, Technology, Art, which are the heritage of Humanity and therefore are the heritage of our People.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Beloved brothers and sisters of the National Police; beloved families of the National Police, a Police force that has been forged over 43 years. One that has been forging itself, preparing, training, to serve the People, to serve the Citizens. Preparing and training also to defend the Right to Peace of all Nicaraguan families, without exception. To defend the Right to Work of all Nicaraguan families, without exception. To defend the Right to Health, without exception; the Right to Health for all Nicaraguan families.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The right to Health is also multiplying, thanks to the efforts of the People-President, and with the unconditional cooperation of brotherly Peoples and institutions that are created to bring aid, cooperation to developing peoples, we have managed to install hospitals, health posts and maternal shelters, throughout the country.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">First-class hospitals, where patients who come from Health Posts, from Health Centers, who need medical care of a higher level, which now requires technology, medical instruments, specialists in the Hospitals that we have in all regions of our Country, patients are received there.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And we continue to open hospitals, even when occasionally some wretched individual may spring out ... the human wretchedness of it! A European country, the Netherlands, a few years ago they committed to building, not one of the big modern hospitals that we are building, but a small clinic, a small hospital in a community on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, where the Original Peoples, the Miskitos, the Mayagnas, the Ramaquí, the Afrodescendants are.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Well, the ambassador of that country came to visit, our Foreign Minister received her yesterday, and what did they hear? The ambassador came to lecture Nicaraguans, as if Nicaragua was a Dutch colony, like one of those they still have in some regions and those that they held and multiplied back when the colonies held by European governments proliferated, colonies of the ruling classes in those European countries.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">They became owners! They became owners and set out to exploit, just as they exploited Our America, they also exploited Africa, Asia. There was no region of the World that was not exploited, dominated, in what is a crime that still stands, a crime that cannot be forgotten, and now some Governments appear to believe this is still the colonial era and that our Peoples and our Governments are still Peoples and Governments submissive to foreign Crowns. Because the governments in question have, many of them, Kings, or Queens.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And after launching that outrageous speech against the dignity of our People, she communicated that they were not going to build their famous hospital, that they were not going to build it. A hospital they had been committed to building for several years, but they had not laid a single stone, not a single brick, and all she had to say were threats, threats and more threats.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And what have we said to this lady ambassador, and what do we say to that Government, to those Ladies and Gentlemen? Here, in this Land, in this Patriotic Nation, our Flag is respected, the Blue and White Flag that our General Sandino defended with the Red and Black Flag... Our flag is respected! And anyone who comes here to disrespect our people, our Patriotic Nation, well, let them not appear again in Nicaragua. We don't want relations with that interventionist government!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Once outside, as the song says so well: Out there they can shout whatever they want, all their miseries they will shout out, but here in Nicaragua, on this Land, we do not allow them to disrespect this People.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We also say the same to the US Senators, who are important Senators, because from the US Senate, from the US Congress, all the interventions that Yankee imperialism has carried out in the world have been endorsed and approved. That is, there they feel like owners of the World and that they can just gobble up its Peoples.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Now it turns out that they proposed an Ambassador for Nicaragua, we gave them the ok when the Placet request proposing the Ambassador arrived. Then the candidate for ambassador to Nicaragua appeared before the Senate, and what took place in the Senate? Insult, disrespect, and talk as if William Walker was coming here to Nicaragua again, to take over Nicaragua. That was how he spoke before the Senate. Then we immediately said: Get out! Get out! He's staying out! And out there, let him keep shouting whatever he wants, but here in Nicaragua, our Flag is respected!</p>

Beloved brother Diego Ariel Rodríguez Camacho, Chargé d'affaires of the Republic of Bolivia. Beloved Central American Brother, Charge d'affaires of the Guatemalan Embassy, Pedro Emilio Lechuga. beloved Central American sister, from the land of Morazán, Marlene Andrade, Chargé d'affaires of the Embassy of Honduras; beloved brother, Colonel Román Gómez Reyes, Attaché of Military, Naval and Air Defense. Beloved State Councilor of Japan, Kawashima Hiroaki... Welcome!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">How many Peoples are represented by these Ambassadors! And there is a cry in all the peoples: Peace! And there is also a Heroic Struggle among these Peoples against the blockade that has been going on for more than 60 years against the sister Republic of Cuba. The Cuba of Martí, the Cuba of Fidel, the Cuba of Raúl, the Cuba of our brother President, who is waging this gigantic Battle against the blockade.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">There has never been a blockade as brutal as the one in place against Cuba, and now our brother Miguel Díaz-Canel is at the forefront, during truly terrible moments, where the blockade has intensified, where difficult situations have occurred, including with this hurricane that has just passed. The country is blockaded, imagine, and a hurricane with devastating power passes causing destruction, death and affecting the entire population.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Why? Because even the electrical power system, the generating stations were shaken, affected by the hurricane. But this is a Heroic People, a People that has been able to withstand a thousand battles and still emerged victorious. And we are sure, beloved brothers and sisters, that Cuba will emerge victorious again, with the Solidarity of the Peoples of the World, in the face of these battles.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">These are the moments in which the cruelty, the brutality of imperialism is exposed; these are the moments in which, if there were even a little humanity left in the United States Government, in the US State, there may be a little Humanity left, because they should lift the blockade.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">These are extreme circumstances that demand the lifting of the blockade, the United Nations should be demanding this, where year after year the vast majority of countries propose the end of the blockade. And this is the moment, at a time when Cuba is suffering like no one else, like no other People, when the blockade on the fraternal Cuban People must be lifted.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And if the blockade is lifted, then we will be able to believe that there is still a little Humanity left in the United States of America. We know that there is Humanity in the American People, in Solidarity with our Struggles and in Solidarity with the Cuban People, but we know that there is no Humanity in the American ruling class, who one by one have been tightening the screw, trying to drown, to murder, to force the People of Cuba to surrender. But the People of Cuba have shown that they are a People who do not sell themselves out, nor will they ever sell themselves out !</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Long live Cuba, and long live that Heroic People !</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Now, sisters and brothers, let's give way to the Parade of our brother and sister Policemen, who after all, it is the People who recognize the value of the Police, the work of the Police, the efficiency of the Police. And naturally the police will have to develop even more, with greater strength and efficiency, with more capabilities, why? To continue combating any and every threat against Nicaragua's families.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Long live the National Police</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">on its 43rd Anniversary!</p>
