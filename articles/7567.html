<em>Financial Times, September 16, 2019</em></div>

<h1>The Global Climate Strikes: No, this was not co-optation. This was and is PR. A brief timeline</h1>

<p><em>Addendum to The Manufacturing of Greta Thunberg – for Consent series, Volume II</em></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2009:</strong> G20 gathering in London: The world’s major economies come together to stem the global financial panic triggered by the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market in the US (and subsequent unprecedented bailouts for corporations and banks). They assure society that they will establish a more stable growth path going forward.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>2009:</strong> UN works on the prospect of a Global Green New Deal to reboot the global economic system. It simultaneously works on tools to assign monetary value to all nature, global in scale, with the goal of creating new markets (TEEB – later to be absorbed by the Natural Capital Coalition).<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>2009-2019:</strong> In the years that followed the 2009 assurances to contain panic in markets and salvage a battered financial system, growth – crucial to keeping the capitalist economic system afloat – failed to find a firm footing.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>2011:</strong> IMF: “We have entered what I have called a dangerous new phase… today, we risk losing the battle for growth. With dark clouds over Europe, and huge uncertainty in the United States, we risk a collapse in global demand. This challenge could not be more urgent. In our interconnected world, we are all on one boat. Any thought of decoupling is a mirage.” — The Path Forward—Act Now and Act Together, opening address to the 2011 Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, managing director, International Monetary Fund<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2014:</strong> Global economy continues to spiral downward. “Capitalism is in danger of falling apart”, Al Gore, Generation Investment, The Climate Reality Project<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2014:</strong> Purpose (PR arm of Avaaz): Language of “green economy” is killed in order to save “green economy”. They will build it, but they won’t say they are building it.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2014:</strong> People’s Climate March. The march was organized by GCCA/TckTckTck (co-founded by 20 NGOs including 350.org, Avaaz, Greenpeace), the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Climate Nexus (a sponsored project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), 350.org (incubated by the Rockefeller Foundation), the Rasmussen Foundation and USCAN.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>2014:</strong> We Mean Business is launched. Created with the assistance of many including then UNFCCC executive secretary Christina Figueres, Purpose (PR arm of Avaaz), and Greenpeace.<br />
	 </li>
	<li><strong>2015:</strong> Global Youth Summit takes place (Keynotes: UN Figueres, Kumi Naidoo Greenpeace, 350.org McKibben), Climate Strike website is created.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2015:</strong> The Paris Agreement largely attributed to Christina Figueres comes into fruition. [Further reading: <a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2016/10/27/this-changes-nothing-the-paris-agreement-to-ignore-reality/"><u>This Changes Nothing – Clive L. Spash</u></a>]<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2015: </strong>Mission Innovation (Breakthrough Energy, Bill Gates, Richard Branson et al.) partners with 23 states and the EU. Similar coalitions and partnerships follow (Under 2C, The Climate Group, etc.).<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2017:</strong> World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab: “Capitalism is in crisis”<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2018:</strong> A teleconference led by a 350.org/Fossil Free representative with Climate Reality Project (Al Gore’s NGO) proposes a large climate march. Greta Thunberg partakes in this call as well as others that transpire. The idea of a strike is presented. Thunberg is receptive<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>May 2018:</strong> Ingmar Rentzhog, founder and CEO of We Don’t Have Time, is featured at a climate event with Greta’s mother Malena Ernman.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>June 2018:</strong> Greta Thunberg social media accounts are created.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Summer/Fall 2018:</strong> The Green New Deal (promoted by UN in 2009) is resurrected.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>July 2018:</strong> The Climate Group, co-founder of We Mean Business, promotes This Is Zero Hour climate strikes in the US utilizing the hashtag #WeDontHave Time [“Join the youth revolution!”]<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>August 20 2018:</strong> Greta sits on a sidewalk with a sign. Rentzhog discovers “the lonely girl”. We Don’t Have Time, partner of The Climate Reality Project, and Global Utmaning (Global Challenge) are interconnected by board relationships.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>August 20 2018:</strong> On the first day of strike, the third person to respond to the “lonely girl” plight on Twitter is We Mean Business co-founder Callum Grieve. He adds the hashtag #WeDontHaveTime and tags five additional accounts: The Climate Museum, Youth Climate March LA, This is Zero Hour Ft. Lauderdale, Greenpeace International, and the UNFCCC, the “official Twitter account of UN Climate Change”.<br />

</div>

<div class="icon-text">
<h5><em><strong>We Mean Business Founding Partners</strong></em></h5>

<p>The founding partners of We Mean Business are BSR, CDP, Ceres, The B Team, The Climate Group, The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group (CLG), and the WBCSD. Together, these organizations represent the most powerful – and ruthless – corporations on the planet, groups salivating to unleash 100 trillion dollars to fuel the fourth industrial revolution – pushed by the World Economic Forum.</p>
</div>

<div class="icon-text">
<h5><strong>We Mean Business Co-founder Callum Grieve</strong></h5>

<p>Grieve is the co-founder and director of Counter Culture, a brand development firm specializing in behavioural change campaigns and storytelling.

	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Fall 2018:</strong> New Deal for Nature and Voice For The Planet campaigns commence. Exploiting an increasingly anxious citizenry, utilizing emotive images and language, these campaigns are in fact, not to “save nature”, rather, they are to monetize nature, global in scale.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 1 2018:</strong> Only 12 days after her first day sitting on a sidewalk, Greta is featured in The Guardian.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 2018:</strong> The largest-ever philanthropic investment to combat climate change is announced by ClimateWorks, largest recipient of climate philanthropy in the world.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 26 2018:</strong> Thunberg appears at a seminar organized by The Climate Reality Project and Global Utmaning (Thunberg’s father denies any relationship or affiliation<br />
	with Global Unmanning).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 26 2018:</strong> The Climate Finance Partnership – a vehicle for blended finance – is unveiled at the One Planet Summit.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>October 31 2018:</strong> Launch of XR global expansion is highlighted by The Guardian and endorsed by an array of liberal celebrity signatories.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>XR global expansion takes place in partnership with The Climate Mobilization Project.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>January 3 2019:</strong> “Global economic growth ‘now in free fall'”<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>January 2019:</strong> Christiana Figueres brings Greta Thunberg to Davos where they share accommodations.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>January 2019:</strong> International media amplifies “The House is on Fire” Thunberg speech delivered at WEF. The message and delivery mirror the stratagem laid out in The Climate Mobilization (XR partner) paper “Leading the Public into Emergency Mode: A New Strategy for the Climate Movement.” (“Imagine there is a fire in your house.”)<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>January 2019</strong>: Davos, Switzerland – “Standing outside in the pitch-black cold at the World Economic Forum on January 23, 2019, a panel including Future Earth and partners announced to a live audience their intent to launch an Earth Commission.”<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>August 2018 to Summer 2019:</strong> An international media assault on the populace featuring Greta Thunberg, adored and promoted by the ruling classes, corporations, institutions, World Bank and finance – this is coupled with apocalyptic media saturation. In effect – the multiple ecological crises which have been increasing over decades, is now being fully exploited as a means to manufacture consent. Corporations and institutions seek 100 trillion dollars for “climate solutions”. The unlocking of pensions is identified as a prime target.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>August 2018 to Summer 2019: </strong>The emergence of a green fascism. Those criticizing the said solutions or “movements” designed by the ruling class for our collective consumption are ridiculed and subjected to hate.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>August 2018 to Summer 2019: </strong>Western “environmentalism” creates demand for the further plundering of the planet in order to “save” the climate – in essence, a globally mobilized de facto green lobby group. The planned “climate” infrastructure eyes the Global South. The scale is massive: equates to the building of a New York City – every single month for the next forty years. Despite the fact that this cannot be squared with protection of biodiversity or the climate, the populace clamours for those in power (who are responsible for the crisis) to “do something” and align with the suicidal Paris Agreement.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>February 20 2019:</strong> We Mean Business and Global Optimist (founded by Christiana Figueres, funded by We Mean Business), highlight the reaction to the climate campaign now well underway: “People are desperate for something to happen”.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>April 2019:</strong> The Rockefeller Foundation closes its 100 Resilient Cities initiative, joins the Atlantic Council to launch a new center. [Explored in Volume II, Act VII]<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>June 13 2019:</strong> The World Economic Forum – representing the richest and most powerful people on the planet – forms a partnership with United Nations.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>July 2019:</strong> “US philanthropists vow to raise millions for climate activists” – The Climate Emergency Fund is launched. Serving on the board is 350.org founder Bill McKibben and Margaret Klein Salamon founder and executive director of The Climate Mobilization (partner to Extinction Rebellion) and author of the paper “Leading the Public into Emergency Mode: A New Strategy for the Climate Movement.”<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 2019:</strong> Greta Thunberg sails across the ocean in a yacht to attend the United Nations Climate Action Summit organized and led by We Mean Business and the World Economic Forum (now partnered with the United Nations).<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 16 2019:</strong> The Financial Times unveils its largest campaign since 2009: The New Agenda – a re-booting of the capitalist system<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 18 2019:</strong> Conservation International and the *Food and Land Use Coalition finance the “Natural Climate Solutions” promotional video featuring Guardian’s Monbiot and Greta Thunberg. The video reaches more than 1 billion people in less than 24 hours. [*Member foundations include ClimateWorks, the David &amp; Lucile Packard Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Gordon &amp; Betty Moore Foundation, Good Energies, and Margaret Cargill.]<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 19 2019:</strong> WEF releases promotional video featuring Greta Thunberg for “Voices For The Planet”. This is the WEF-WWF campaign for the financialization of nature, global in scale (payments for ecosystem services) that accompanies the “New Deal For Nature” promoted by WWF, CI, The Natural Capital Coalition, TNC, etc.. Supported by Greenpeace, 350.org, etc. who are not yet publicly promoting it.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 20 2019:</strong> Global Climate Strikes take place.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 2019:</strong> Many smaller NGOs, including those from the Global South oppose the WEF-UN Partnership. Avaaz, Greenpeace, 350, etc. are conspicuously absent from the signatories.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September 26 2019:</strong> The UN calls for a Global Green New Deal (bailout).<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>September to October 2019:</strong> Arnold Schwarzenegger arranges a Tesla for Greta to tour Canada and visit Standing Rock reservation.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>We dance to the tune of our oppressors</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The ruling class exists, it’s not a conspiracy theory. They operate as a class, too. They share the same values, the same sensibility and in Europe and North America they are white. They act in accordance with their interests, which are very largely identical. The failure to understand this is the single greatest problem and defect in left discourse today.”</p>

<p>— John Steppling</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Climate change is real – but capitalism is the crisis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The structure of the system is working exactly as it is designed to. The NPIC exists to insulate the current power structures and capital itself.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Economic growth is sacrosanct – to those in power, and those it serves. Economic growth trumps all priorities including life itself.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The Thunberg campaign belongs to the ruling class, not to the people.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A decade of social engineering (“together”) has effectively erased class analysis, which is a massive blow, and even a betrayal, to the working class and peasantry.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The West is under the rule of a corporatocracy, therefore voting is a massive distraction and spectacle that will never solve or mitigate our ecological crisis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The same system that created the crisis will not and cannot now rectify the crises. The same people that protected and defended this system will do anything and exploit anyone to keep it intact.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The NGOs comprising the NPIC must be isolated, shamed and abandoned. The exact methods they use against radical activists and radical grassroots groups. Without the support of the people, they lose all power and influence (and then funding).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A litmus test must be placed on all organizations that claim to fight for ecological and social justice: They must be united in opposition to imperialism/colonialism, militarism, white supremacy and patriarchy – all leading drivers of climate change and ecological devastation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Capitalism will destroy everything in its path. Either we kill capitalism, or capitalism will kill us.<br />
	 </li>
