<p><em><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Opposition media from both Nicaragua and El Salvador, along with the Washington Post, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, all vilify  Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega by equating him with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Although Ortega and Bukele are both serving consecutive terms, and a Central American polling firm reports that they enjoy high popularity among their respective populations, the two presidents actually offer a study in contrasts.</span></span></span></span></span></strong></em></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Crime and punishment</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Bukele is praised for drastically reducing violence in El Salvador, but his political career is actually based on perpetuating it. First, some history. The country’s gang problem originated in the bloody US-supported war of the 1980s, including US and Israeli funding and training of death squads, that forced thousands of young men to escape forced military recruitment by fleeing to the United States. As an underclass of undocumented immigrants, and without the support of their families, many of these young men wound up in gangs on the streets of Los Angeles or in its prisons. In the mid-1990s, thousands of these gang members were deported to El Salvador, bringing violence back to a country that had just lost 75,000 lives in a brutal conflict. As </span></span><a class="0" href="https://jacobin.com/2017/07/usaid-el-salvador-gangs-drug-war-security-fmln-arena" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Hillary Goodfriend</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> writes, “<span><span>the devastated neoliberal economic landscape proved fertile terrain for the US gang culture imported by Salvadoran youth deported from Los Angeles in the mid-1990s.” </span></span>The right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) governments of the postwar years responded to the gang problem with an iron fist.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Then from 2009-2019, while the former guerrillas (Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación Nacional—FMLN) were in office, a preventive approach was attempted. Structural problems were addressed with “unprecedented increases in social spending, including critical education, health care, land, infrastructure and agricultural investment.” But these efforts were frustrated by a majority opposition legislature that limited spending on such programs, and USAID funding for a private sector approach that favored the opposition. The FMLN also made its own mistakes, including secret negotiations (along with the Catholic Church) for a gang truce, which was initially successful but politically costly once it fell apart. Still, progress was made as Salvadoran youth found more alternatives.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Nayib Bukele arrived on the national scene as the FMLN candidate for mayor of San Salvador in 2014. There has been suspicion that his political rise was based on secret deals with the gangs, and an increasing number of </span></span></span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/secret-bukele-trump-deal-grenas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>international media</span></span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span><span><span> are giving details on how that worked. He is alleged to have </span></span></span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/29/trump-favorite-president-el-salvador-nayib-bukele/83896220007/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>bribed the gangs</span></span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span><span><span> for their loyalty in that mayoral race, outbidding the ARENA candidate by a two to one margin. Bukele soon broke with the FMLN and ran against the party in the 2019 presidential election. MS-13 gang leaders are alleged to have negotiated with him prior to the vote, demanding an end to extraditions to the US, shortened sentences, and control of territory. In return they reduced the homicide rate by hiding their crimes. After Bukele’s election, the official murder rate fell, but disappearances went up. This gang also helped him get out the vote for his legislative supermajority in 2021, sometimes violently. While he colludes with the gangs in secret, the public face of Bukele’s crime policy is a return to the repression of the ARENA years.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In March 2022, Bukele instituted a state of exception which persists to this day and has led to the imprisonment of an additional 85,000 people, giving El Salvador the highest incarceration rate in the world. Several social movement leaders are among those detained without trial. Meanwhile, many Salvadorans enjoy comparative safety in the country’s streets since the gang violence is less visible and small businesses no longer have to make extortion payments. This, along with </span></span></span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/el-salvador-politics-media/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>savvy manipulation</span></span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span><span><span> of social media, has made the president extremely popular among a segment of the population, particularly voters living in the diaspora. Now Bukele has gleefully agreed to serve as an offshore jailer for Donald Trump, and seems to delight in images of dehumanized inmates in crowded cells, indicating that they will never leave. Conditions are torturous and rehabilitation is non-existent. As </span></span></span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/nayib-bukele-worlds-coolest-dictator/289493/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>Alan MacLeod reports</span></span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span><span><span>, “cruelty is the point.” And violence persists.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The photos at the top of this article show the stark contrast in attitude towards prisoners in Nicaragua vs. El Salvador. While Bukele serves cruelty and humiliation, Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega focuses on human dignity and rehabilitation—particularly through education. A </span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/159364-formacion-tecnica-y-academica-para-8429-personas-de-los-sistema-penitenciario-del-pais" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>recent article</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> tells of some 8,400 inmates enrolled in university studies, vocational programs, and completing primary and secondary schooling. Inmates are also allowed to work, if they so choose, and their earnings are sent to their families. Sentences are frequently reduced for good behavior. Reconciliation is a hallmark of the Sandinista movement, which abolished the death penalty in 1979. Corporate media stories about “political prisoners” are part of a US-funded propaganda campaign and should be viewed skeptically. </span></span><a class="0" href="https://fair.org/home/nicaraguas-political-prisoners-would-be-criminals-by-us-standards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>This article</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> gives information about the heinous crimes committed by those US media heroes.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In Nicaragua there is minimal gang activity, drug trafficking, and drug abuse. At 6 per 100,000 inhabitants, the country’s </span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1002683/homicide-rate-nicaragua/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>homicide rate</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> has been declining since 2007 and is currently just below that of the US. This decrease is thanks to successful implementation of the kinds of social programs the FMLN attempted in El Salvador, which have engaged the youth and greatly reduced poverty. It has been a steady, long-term process that prioritizes the formerly impoverished majority; not an illusion for social media. People are empowered by creative programs that help farmers feed their families and communities, support entrepreneurs in starting a business, promote women’s health and safety, reinstate rights to Afro-descendant and Indigenous peoples, and allow Nicaraguans of all ages to get an education. These are not changes that can easily be turned back, and are the reason that Daniel Ortega keeps getting a larger and larger percentage of the vote in each election.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>NGOs</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Washington Post and Amnesty International inaccurately equate El Salvador’s new Foreign Agents Law with Nicaragua’s non-profits law. The Nicaraguan law requires organizations to report payments coming from outside the country and tell how such money is spent, prohibiting the use of foreign monies for political activity. It is meant to curtail foreign interference like the 2018 coup attempt that subjected the Nicaraguan population to three months of politically-motivated terror. </span></span><a class="0" href="https://thegrayzone.com/2021/06/01/cia-usaid-nicaragua-right-wing-media/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>This article</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> provides detailed documentation of the extensive flow of USAID regime-change money to Nicaraguan opposition and media outlets before 2022. In a shameless admission that they are still dependent on US funding, the Nicaraguan opposition took to social media at the start of the second Trump administration to decry the </span></span><a class="0" href="https://x.com/johnperry21/status/1881898712773067161" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>crisis</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> they had fallen into because </span></span><a class="0" href="https://confidencial.digital/english/u-s-ends-92-aid-programs-for-activists-and-opposition-in-nicaragua-cuba-and-venezuela/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>their US funding was cut</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span>. Contrary to what the Post and Amnesty would have us believe, media outlets dependent on US government funding are not “independent.” Unfortunately, USAID/NED funding for Nicaraguan opposition media operating outside the country has already been reinstated.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>El Salvador has also been targeted by USAID in the past for political purposes, including during the FMLN administrations. <span><span>US meddling is less likely to target Bukele, given his close alignment with the Trump administration. Criticism of the new law’s provision to charge Salvadoran charities a 30% tax on international donations does seem valid. In Nicaragua, most charitable organizations pay a 1% administrative fee on international donations, while the wealthiest charities pay up to 3%—a far cry from Bukele’s 30% tax.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Treatment of Migrants</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Ortega never participated in the schemes the Trump and Biden administrations negotiated with Nicaragua’s northern neighbors to inhibit the flow of migrants; nor did he impose a ‘special fee’ on </span></span><a class="0" href="https://ayuda.avianca.com/hc/en-us/articles/19744371443355-Airport-Improvement-Tariff-at-El-Salvador-International-Airport" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>migrants in transit from Africa</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span>, as Bukele did. Nicaragua accepted direct flights from Haiti and Cuba as a humanitarian gesture to ease the crises that US intervention created in those countries. For a period, Nicaragua was a transit country for migrants looking for an inexpensive and safer route to the US that avoided the dangerous Darien Gap. It was rewarded with baseless accusations of “human trafficking” by the US Congress.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Meanwhile, Bukele zealously collaborates with Trump’s mass deportation/incarceration plan for migrants, even refusing to release a wrongfully deported Salvadoran man. Daniel Ortega has </span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.facebook.com/jpmascentroamerica/posts/el-copresidente-de-nicaragua-daniel-ortega-denunci%C3%B3-el-encarcelamiento-injustifi/705629808801788/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>adamantly denounced this</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span>, demanded the return of the kidnapped Venezuelans held in El Salvador, and pleaded for respect for all migrants. Nicaraguan migrants who are deported home from the US are welcomed with free health check-ups, a meal, transportation to their home communities, and a small stipend to get re-settled.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Handling of the COVID-19 pandemic</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>El Salvador had one of the most authoritarian responses to the pandemic. The Bukele government shut down the economy,  </span></span><a class="0" href="https://coha.org/el-salvador-bukeles-heavy-handed-response-to-covid-19-pandemic-violates-human-rights/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>used military repression</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> to enforce a nationwide quarantine, declared a state of exception, and forced people into COVID detention centers, where many were infected and some died. Bukele tweeted sadistic photos of gang members crowded together like sardines in prisons—bragging about his repressive response with no regard for the danger of spreading the virus. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>President Ortega did the exact opposite: the economy and schools remained open, while children continued to receive their daily lunches. The government deployed a massive public health campaign with house-to-house information visits, prepared public hospitals to treat COVID, established a hotline for contact tracing and monitoring of patients, and released some prisoners. No one was jailed or went hungry due to the pandemic; the government did not incur excessive debt; and Nicaragua achieved the highest vaccination rate in Central America.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Nicaragua had </span></span><a class="0" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-deaths-cumulative-per-100k-economist?region=NorthAmerica&amp;globe=1&amp;globeRotation=43%2C-94.5&amp;globeZoom=1.5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>one of the lowest excess death rates</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> from the pandemic in the world (292 per 100,000 inhabitants). </span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.nicasolidarity.com/health" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>UNICEF congratulated Nicaragua</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> on its pandemic response because unlike children who faced lockdowns, Nicaraguan youngsters did not experience more health risks, poorer nutrition, decreased vaccination rates, or diminished education outcomes due to the pandemic.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Salvadoran children, unfortunately, faced all the detrimental effects of an extreme lockdown. The country’s democracy suffered, the economy shrank severely, and the government incurred tremendous debt. The excess death rate in El Salvador due to the pandemic was 364 per 100,000 inhabitants.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Israel/Palestine</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Historically, Zionist collaboration with right-wing repression in </span></span><a class="0" href="https://merip.org/1986/05/israel-in-central-america/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Central America</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> has included the selling of napalm to ARENA governments to use on the Salvadoran people, and aid for Nicaragua’s Somoza dictatorship and <em>contra</em> terrorists.  Now, despite Bukele’s Palestinian heritage, he has clearly allied with Israel. His imports of </span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/bukele-israel-dictatorship-surveillance/289578/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Israeli weapons and surveillance technology</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span> are growing at an alarming rate, and El Salvador is one of the most extensive users of Israel’s Pegasus spyware, reportedly deployed against dozens of Bukele’s critics.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In contrast, Sandinista Nicaragua has a long history of </span></span><a class="0" href="https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/article/nicaragua-and-palestine-enduring-mutual-solidarity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span>solidarity with the Palestinian people</span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span><span>. Since October 7, 2023, Ortega has resolutely supported the Palestinian people’s right to peace and self-determination and the end of Israeli aggression. His was the first nation to join the South Africa suit at the International Court of Justice over Israel’s violations of the Genocide Convention. Nicaragua then filed its own suit against Germany for aiding and abetting genocide, which succeeded in reducing weapons sales to Israel and reinstating German funding to UNRWA. Nicaragua does this despite threats of increased sanctions from the US Congress and Israel.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Government social spending</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since Bukele became president, classic neoliberal policies have cut education, healthcare, and poverty reduction programs introduced by the FMLN governments before him. Schools are being closed and healthcare is increasingly unaffordable. Meanwhile, there are constant increases in spending on the military, policing, and prisons.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Social spending has been a priority for Nicaragua since President Ortega took office in 2007 and now constitutes 60% of the national budget. There have been vast improvements in health, education, nutrition, housing, drinking water, roads, and electricity.
