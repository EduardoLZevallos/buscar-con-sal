      <br>
Plenty of people have written recently on the death of US historian
Howard Zinn. Alternative media outlets like Counterpunch, ZNet and
Dissident Voice published several articles in Zinn's honour which might
lead a casual visitor to those web sites to think they shared Zinn's
commitment to open debate and factual analysis. They would be wrong. On
Nicaragua, those flagship web sites for the North American radical
progressive movements have spread falsehoods and suppressed debate. <br>
      <br>
The editors at Dissident Voice recently had sufficient chutzpah to
publish an article by William Blum in which Blum repeats, &#8220;One of my
favorite Howard Zinn quotes: "The chief problem in historical honesty
is not outright lying. It is omission or de-emphasis of important
data.&#8221;(1) That could hardly be more true of those progressive web
sites' coverage of Nicaragua since late 2008. They have shown constant
ideological hostility to Nicaragua's revolutionary governing party, the
Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (FSLN).<br>
      <br>
Back in November 2008, the international corporate media mounted a
fierce anti-FSLN campaign supporting false Nicaraguan right-wing
opposition claims of massive systematic fraud in the country's
municipal elections held in November 2008. Those claims were never
substantiated - nor could they be, since they were entirely false. But
the repeated assertion was enough to trigger condemnation of the vote
by Western Bloc governments &#8211; the US and Canada, European Union
countries and their Pacific allies - and punitive measures clearly
aimed at damaging the FSLN's ability to implement its program of
government. All the condemnation and extortionate economic pressure
failed.<br>
      <br>
The European Union withheld over US$40m in budget support. The US State
Department ordered the cutting of US$60m in development aid via the
Millenium Challenge Account. The pretext for that criminal extortion at
the expense of the Nicaraguan people was an alleged threat to
democracy, implying a systematic denial of civil and political rights
to people in Nicaragua. Subsequent events have demonstrated the absurd
falsity of such claims. Despite that rich-country extortion - "do what
we want or else" - Nicaragua's Sandinista-led government proceeded
successfully with its programme by seeking alternative funding and
making appropriate spending cuts. <br>
      <br>
Even so, the false claims of the Nicaraguan right wing opposition have
been repeated and elaborated in articles published in Counterpunch,
ZNet and Dissident Voice. Editors of those websites have suppressed
attempts to refute the falsehoods they published. When that fact was
pointed out to the well-known progressive, media-monitoring
organization Media Lens, the editors of that site did not even reply.
As Enrique Ubieta Gómez reminded us recently, for the international
right wing &#8220;political debate turns not on truth but on power, it does
not try to demonstrate or convince with arguments or factual
information but rather to impose, to confuse, to surprise and to induce
fear,&#8221; (2) The same applies to á la carte imperialist fellow-travellers
too.<br>
      <br>
It is not just on Nicaragua that these alternative media operate in
practice as fellow-travellers of their governments and corporate media.
For example, Counterpunch editorials regularly pour scorn on people
actively trying to discover what really happened during the attacks on
New York and Washington on September 11th 2001. The editorials dismiss
such concerns as pointless conspiracy theory. Still, Counterpunch
editorials themselves aggressively stoke the theory of a conspiracy
promoting false arguments to demonstrate disastrous human-made climate
change. The criteria for such a double-standard seem to be entirely
arbitrary.<br>
      <br>
Both positions chime well with important government and corporate
briefings on those issues. Counterpunch regularly publishes critical
comment by former US government officials, including loyal but
dissident former US military and CIA officers. For its part, ZNet
regularly publishes articles that have appeared elsewhere in corporate
media like the UK Guardian. In accordance with North American liberal
and European social democrat tradition, all these alternative sites
tend to prioritize and strongly emphasize civil and political rights
over social and economic rights. <br>
      <br>
So while Counterpunch will campaign for political prisoners like the
Cuban Five, they will also not infrequently publish articles attacking
Hugo Chavez or Daniel Ortega. All these alternative news outlets adopt
positions that amount to a kind of&nbsp; narcissistic neocolonialism.
So long as the beneficiaries of their solidarity are in some kind of
dependent or subordinate state, they get sympathetic treatment.
Political movements showing determined independence and autonomy &#8211; like
the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, the FARC in Colombia or, to some extent,
the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela, tend generally to be ignored,
patronized or attacked.<br>
      <br>
These alternative web sites could all fairly be described as
anti-Communist. It may be wrong to describe them as imperialist
fellow-travellers &#8211; but they are can hardly be described as&nbsp;
anti-imperialist, as their treatment of Nicaragua amply demonstrates.
If one looks for the most unstinting, while critical, support for the
Bolivarian and Sandinista revolutionary processes in Venezuela and
Nicaragua in recent years, it has been the international Communist
Parties that have given it, welcome or not. The support &#8211; or otherwise
- of the opportunist neocolonial Left is defined as much by their
marketing requirements as by any principled commitment.<br>
      <br>
The fundamental objection to the editorial practice of these
alternative media is that they prioritize the self-regard of themselves
and their market audience over the well-being of millions of people
determined to achieve a better life and self-determination despite
vicious opposition from the Western Bloc powers. On Nicaragua, a
handful of individuals in the North American and European progressive
and radical movements have used their influence to collaborate with
Western Bloc, rich-country policy. Editorial policy on Nicaragua at
Counterpunch, ZNet and Dissident Voice through 2009 and to date has
betrayed the impoverished majority in Nicaragua, aiding that majority's
local and regional enemies, a tiny, but influential, local managerial
elite supported by the US government. <br>
      <br>
The truth about Nicaragua is&nbsp; that education, health care and
infrastructure have been greatly improved under Daniel Ortega's
Sandinista-led coalition government, despite persistent practical
problems. Investment in agricultural production, small and medium sized
businesses and in electricity generating capacity have promoted a
resurgence in the country's productive capacity for both domestic and
export markets.&nbsp; Contrary to international feminist propaganda,
the position of women has improved markedly in terms of economic
rights, broader representation as decision-makers and health issues
like maternal mortality. <br>
      <br>
Politically, the Sandinista government now seems to command over 40%
electoral support while the combined support of all the opposition
parties is around 15%-20%, with a large bloc of voters uncommitted to
either grouping. The opposition regularly hold much-hyped but, on the
day, disappointing marches. They control the national Press and
dominate national television and radio. Civil and political rights in
Nicaragua are incomparably better defended than under Porfirio Lobo in
Honduras or Mauricio Funes in El Salvador. In both those countries
journalists, environmentalists, trades unionists and human rights
activists are regularly detained and tortured or murdered.<br>
      <br>
Rather than acknowledge that reality in Nicaragua, Counterpunch, ZNet
and Dissident Voice have spread imperialist propaganda (3) and
suppressed information exposing the falsehoods and outright lies on
which that propaganda is based. If they do so in relation to events in
Nicaragua, they may well do so on other issues too. It is entirely
justifiable on the basis of their coverage of Nicaragua to talk about a
neocolonial Left working in tacit sympathy with relatively liberal
elements of their countries' governments, in the same way as other
non-governmental outfits in sectors like human rights, or aid and
development, have done for decades.<br>

3. The following articles recycling right-wing Nicaraguan opposition
and US State Department&nbsp; propaganda have appeared either in
Counterpunch, ZNet, or Dissident Voice over the last twelve months: <br>
&#8220;Et Tu, Daniel :The Sandinista Revolution Betrayed&#8221;, Roger Burbach;&nbsp; <br>
&#8220;Ortega Organizes Street Gangs to Quash Public Dissent : Fear in
Nicaragua&#8221;, Danny Weil; &#8220;Living the farce : Nicaragua Now&#8221;, Clifton
Ross. <br>
Tortilla con Sal's responses to Burbach's article were blocked by
Counterpunch, ZNet and Dissident Voice. When we pointed this out to
Media Lens, that site's editors failed to reply. <br>
