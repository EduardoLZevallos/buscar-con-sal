<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Thank you, General, for your words that summarize a New Stage in the History of our Country, in what is not only the Constitution of a New Army, but also the Constitution of a Comprehensive Military Medical Corps.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">In this New Stage, and as we have well known, when we talk about the Army and the Army Hospital, it is not that the Army Hospital is only for Soldiers and Officers; it is there to serve the Comrades, logically, in their respective Units, in the Areas where they are located, in the different points of our Territory. But wherever there is a Unit, no matter how small, serving the Soldiers, that Unit is also fully willing to serve the Peasants, the Families that move around it.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">The same can be said of this Monumental Hospital, the Military Hospital, because one might think that the Military Hospital is only to attend the Military. It is to serve the Military, of course, the Military Families, but also to serve Nicaraguan Brothers, Workers, Workers, who are part of Social Security, and even those who are not part of Social Security. In other words, Hospitals, Medical Services with doors open to serve Nicaraguans.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And this year, the Country, and the World, is the date and it is still felt that there is enormous pressure, a huge challenge, in the face of a Pandemic that has a totally global impact, which is not limited to a Territory, which is not limited to a Region or a Continent, which is not limited to causing ailments and the death of some patients, as usually happens with any type of serious ailment, but also, due to the panic that it has sown, has led to the paralysis of the Planet . That had never happened in the face of a Pandemic.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">In this war that we are living, here yes, here yes, nobody escapes. And who is the enemy? Well, a virus, one of the many viruses that have struck down Humanity, that have affected Humanity, that have already caused thousands and millions of deaths in other times. But this is a virus that attacked, appeared, where it seemed that the World, seen from what is the mirror, the lure, the fantasy of the Capitalist World in Globalization processes, launching into military adventures against Developing Countries, in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, but they are increasingly cohesive and more united in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in NATO, together there bombing, destroying countries like Libya.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">NATO, imagine, destroying Libya, destroying the Maghreb Area, and thereby causing millions of immigrants who were working in that area when it was a Zone of Peace, of Development. When it was destroyed, they were left in Extreme Poverty, without medical attention, and well, they are looking to Europe because they have to cross the Mediterranean Sea just to be in Europe. And there is that other great tragedy, the tragedy of immigrants, there are millions of immigrants, and thousands of immigrants die every year. A terrible situation.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And well, it was the perfect World, the perfect World for capitalists, for Capitalism, for Imperialism, the Perfect World. Why? Because they were dominating freely, and joined forces when they were interested in destroying a Social, Revolutionary Project, which for them was inadmissible, only their Project was admissible, submitted to their dictates, submitted to their power.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Then, suddenly in this world that looked perfect, for them, it was not perfect for the developing peoples, in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, nor was it perfect for the Workers, for the People from Developed Countries, who lived in poverty and continue to live in poverty, who despite so much wealth could not access medical care in a country as powerful as the United States of America. And that is an issue that has been publicly disputed: The privatization of Health!</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Well, in this World that seemed perfect for them, logically imperfect for the Developing Peoples, the virus appeared; a virus that according to the installed capacities, in terms of resources, economic power, in terms of what they said worked perfectly in their respective countries, then that virus would have been easily contained, or with relative ease.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">But, how incredible, how incredible, that Developed Countries, the United States of America itself, were and are still having great difficulties to have enough instruments to help people who are in critical condition. They don't! But worse still, they do not have enough beds to accommodate patients who already demand hospital care against this virus.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">So what does this make clear to us? That they had worked for their own well-being thinking that having good hospitals for people of resources, who could take good care of themselves, who could eat well, wealthy people, people with a lot of capital, was enough, and that those who could die, Those who could get sick, those who could suffer serious problems, were the people with the least resources; but there it happened that the virus did not make differences, it has not made differences.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And what use are the Atomic Bombs? What good are the Atomic Bombs? Are they going to drop Atomic Bombs on the virus? Are you going to use their most sophisticated weapons and those they continue to develop to dominate space militarily, are they going to use them to destroy the virus?</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">But it is that this virus sowed such panic, yes, it sowed such panic, where we could say that all the panic that they had sown in other Times accumulated there, to such a degree that it paralyzed the Economy, paralyzed Commerce, sent everyone to lock himself in his house, to do the ostrich's; When faced with an epidemic like this, logically, a series of Measures would have to be taken, Measures that would allow the least number of people to die, that the greatest number of affected citizens could be treated.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">But that is where the mirage collided with reality, because it was discovered what I was telling you before, that in Countries that were supposed to have enough beds to care for patients, not from this virus, but from any disease, from so many diseases that Citizens in the World die, or in accidents, all that we already know, when this virus appears and people seek care, they find that Hospitals in Developed Countries do not have enough beds.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And we have seen this there in the spots on television, which shows that the Health issue has to be reviewed in depth, at the World Level, and in particular the Countries have to review it and consider new Strategies, new Programs and new Projects More Developed Capitalists, and that leads them to the conclusion, that instead of filling the Planet with Atomic Bombs, it must be filled with Medical Care, Work, Food, Education, so that what is Preventive Medicine can be consolidated.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And also, in the face of this experience that has paralyzed the World and until now the World is still paralyzed, then, instead of investing in more Atomic Bombs that are of little use against attacks like these, we must also invest in Hospitals, in Health Posts, in Health Centers, in Technologies.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">In other words, the great lesson to be drawn from this Epidemic is that the Capitalist World believed itself invincible, because it has been the possessor and is the possessor of Economic Power, it has been the possessor and is the possessor of Military Power, of the development of Science and Technology, that which made him feel strong, powerful, safe, calm.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">That security can no longer exist from the moment this COVID-19 Pandemic was installed in the world. This calls, therefore, for a change in Economic Policies, Commercial Policies, Social Policies, in order to have a Health System really in a position to face viruses like this and others that can arise at any time, because that is the truth, anytime.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And here in our country we already know the efforts that have been made, with great limitations, the damage that the economy has suffered, a damage in 2018, a damage to the economy, and in 2019 we were getting up, and now in 2020 the economy damaged again, not only in Nicaragua, in the world, but, of course, a country that is poorer, with fewer resources, a situation like this causes the more damage.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">But with our limited possibilities we made a Plan as a State, for what? To face this Pandemic. And there the entire Health System ... We have made Recognition of the National Health System, the Public Health System, the Private Health System, and in this particular case we must Recognize the Health System of the Military Medical Corps of Nicaraguan Army. We know how they battled and how they continue to battle, not only against the virus, because we must also </span></span></strong><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">attend to other illnesses, other diseases that </span></span></strong><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">demand the attention of other patients, treatments,</span></span></strong><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal"> operations.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">But an overexertion was made and an overexertion continues, tensing to the maximum; some Medical Brothers died as well, as an effect of the virus. Because indisputably the Doctor is stuck there, where the danger is, where the risk is, and there has not been a Doctor who hesitates, or a Doctor who says, I am not going to attend, but there has been a great Firmness, a great Strength, a great Dignity, and great Loyalty in the Defense of the Life of the Nicaraguan people. And we recognize this in particular of the Military Medical Corps and the Military Hospital for the services it has been providing in the face of this Pandemic.</span></span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Dear Nicaraguan Brothers, Dear Families, on your behalf we salute and congratulate the Comrades of the Military Medical Corps. We stand in solidarity with the Families that have had Members who have died due to the virus or for other causes, in compliance with their Duty. And we tell you that you, Dear Brothers, deserve all our Respect, all our Recognition as Men and Women who are willing to give their lives in the fight for the Defense of the Life of the Nicaraguan Brothers, that they have to go to the Health System and that they have to go to the Military Medical Services.</span></span></strong></p>
