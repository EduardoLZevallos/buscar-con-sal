in the Midday Edition of Multinoticias Channel 4<br />
<br />
April 29th 2025</strong></em></p>

<p>A very good afternoon, Compañera. Good afternoon, beloved Families of our Blessed Nicaragua. Full of Peace, full of Love, full of Faith, full of Hope, full of Certainty.</p>

<p>We dream, and we know that our Dreams are coming true, they will come true, because we are full of that Heroic, Victorious Energy which allows us to move forward every day, defending and safeguarding Peace, as a Foundation, as the Foundation Stone of everything we want,  all that we long for and all that we are going to achieve.</p>

<p>While bitterness and anger are eating away at those unforgivable people, those condemnable people, while their Hearts are burning with so much frustration, here our People are going Forward, proclaiming Peace and the Right of Everyone to live peacefully, safely, working in prosperity.</p>

<p>The condemnable ones, the unforgivable ones, the ones who will never be able to return to this Land which does not belong to them; those who continue to proliferate slander and lies, because it is the only thing they have: Their lies, their slander, the only thing they have left. And that doesn't yields nothing, and it doesn't offer anything at all. Because the world’s Peoples want Peace, the world’s Peoples want to work and prosper, living safely and contentedly.</p>

<p>Because we too deserve to live in security, to live contentedly, to live in Peace, to live peacefully, with all our rights secured, restored and recovered. Because, who was it who denied our People their Rights? We already know the answer. And here we make our way, every day recovering Rights, every day advancing with those Rights of ours that are inalienable.</p>

<p>They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They! We are about to conclude April, a dark moment for them, but one Victorious for the Brave, Noble, Loving, Christian and Fraternal People, inspired by Solidarity, of this Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Disconcerting for them. That they set out on an adventure, and They Couldn't see it through, Nor Will they...!  Disaster. Failure. Defeat...! A disastrous adventure, an adventure that has brought about the repudiation, hatred, rejection of the majority of Nicaraguans... That’s what they represent.</p>

<p>And there is neither Forgiveness nor Forgetting. They will never be forgiven, because to attack the Sacred Blood of a People that has given so much, to defame without scruple a People that has defended True Truths so much. There is no forgiveness, there can be no Forgiveness and there is no Forgiveness, there is no Forgetting...! And making amends is always pending. No repetition, but but making amends.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are going to finish April, we are going to celebrate Labor Day in a big way, we are going to celebrate Life in Peace, with Security in a big way. God's Gift is Peace, a Miracle that we must continue to make an absolute reality every day, because it is the Heritage, the Merit, the Right, and also the Responsibility of an entire People, and our People is an Example and Inspiration for the Free Peoples of the World.</p>

<p>And We are Going Onward with the Free Peoples of the World, demanding the Right to live in Peace. Each People in its History, each People in its circumstances, each People with its Rights, restoring the Rights that their enemies have tried to take from us throughout history. But They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They, Ever!<br />
<br />
Tomorrow we will be in the Squares of all our Sacred Nicaragua, Holy Nicaragua, celebrating Peace and Work, Peace and Security, Peace and the Future.</p>

<p>With Peace there is Education, there is Health...! We will never forget how they wreaked violence in Schools and Colleges, how they destroyed Universities, how they destroyed Health Centers, how they destroyed Hospitals, how they wanted to destroy us all. But Love is stronger than Hate. It was a grotesque, diabolical expression of hatred when those devils appeared.</p>

<p>But after all, this People fought out of Love, our People fought out of Love and the Right to Peace and Goodness, and we have overcome, we are overcoming, and we will continue to overcome, because Peace is our Heroic Heritage, and in Peace we are moving onward.</p>

<p>Bitterness fuels failure. We are going onward, inaugurating more Schools and Colleges, more Universities, more Hospitals; in Somotillo the Hospital there which was wonderful; the Camilo Torres Center, which we will be inaugurating tomorrow also, for a series of courses for Agroexport Careers, there in Matagalpa where there is so much to export and so much to produce, and so much to work for and so much to learn.<br />
<br />
In Matagalpa, where they knew how to defend our Right to live in Peace with True Spirituality above all; Spirituality, Faith, above all. We are not talking about satanic, diabolical explorations, we are talking about Faith, Spirituality and True Christianity.</p>

<p>Camilo Torres, Father, Guerrilla fighter, Comandante, that is the name of that Center of Studies, for Peace and for Development, for Social Justice, there in Matagalpa.</p>

<p>Then, as we were saying, we are also going to be here in the Square, in the Plaza de la Fé, precisely in the Plaza de la Fé, thousands of Historic Combatants, thousands of Working Brothers and Sisters, thousands of Compañeras and Compañeros of the Volunteer Police, thousands of Compañeras and Compañeros Officers of our Army, Soldiers of our Army; thousands of Compañeras and Compañeros of the Ministry of the Interior, of the National Police, and Public Workers.</p>

<p>We are going to be there tomorrow, to commit ourselves more than ever to these Paths, these Paths of Peace, of Justice, of Truth, and of the demand for Amends. And how are those amends demanded? Doing Justice... So They Will Not Come Back! Doing justice, because Love for Nicaragua cannot be violated, love for Nicaragua belongs to Nicaraguans. Those who hated the People and Nicaragua, do not belong to this Nicaraguan People, which knows very well of Struggles and Honor!</p>

<p>Here we are, studying, healing, taking care of ourselves, creating more and more Bridges, Roads, Streets, Housing, Equitable Development Projects, out of Love for Nicaragua, out of Justice, for Truth and for the creation of the Future. Believing in God the Father Almighty and believing in the People, in the Dignity of the People, in the Soul of the People, who is God Almighty.</p>

<p>And We are going Forward, We are Going Onward, desecrating neither our Sacred Land, nor our Sacrosanct Love for this Blessed Nation, Blessed every day with more Glories, more Victories of Concord among Families, for Peace. Family and Community Values.</p>

<p>We are inaugurating the Second Women's Commissary in San Francisco Libre, today. Making Number 419.</p>

<p>We are also completing and delivering Housing in Santa Rosa del Peñón; Streets in Tipitapa, Larreynaga, Nueva Guinea, Managua; and Trade Schools in Waspam, Matagalpa and El Almendro. Fire stations in Villa Sandino; in Granada the Mayor's Office is ensuring equipment to maintain Roads; in Bocana de Paiwas, maintenance of the Villa Siquia barge; and also Drainage, Sanitation, Risk Mitigation. All this from the municipalities.</p>

<p>Water in Villa Sandino... More Works of Progress and for Rights, that Inalienable Right of Water for the People! In ENACAL we are informed that the works of the Drinking Water Improvement Project in the Municipal Capital of Villa Sandino have been completed.</p>

<p>Then we also have the MAG, which reports National Beef Production at 103 million pounds between January and March of this year.<br />
MARENA... Meeting with Dairy Companies, this time it was the turn of San Miguelito in Río San Juan, with the Company "LACTONIC". Working to produce while respecting the Rights of Mother Earth.</p>

<p>Then INTA... A National Meeting of Seed Growers, Seed Producers, commemorating the 13th Anniversary of the Transit to Immortality of our Comandante Tomás, which tomorrow we are also going to commemorate in a big way.</p>

<p>Zero Usury... 1,000 Protagonists in 48 Municipalities, receiving financing to produce more and produce better, obtaining better yields. Improving life. Work, Human Security, Peace and Well-being, Progress, Prosperity... Improvement in the Life of Everyone with Justice!</p>

<p>We also have, Compañeras and Compañeros, the Secretariat of the Creative Economy launching the II National Open Innovation Season in conjunction with our country’s Universities.</p>

<p>We also have "Creative April“ at the Rubén Darío National Theater, which will present the ”WIPO Awards for Creativity", in conjunction with the Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce.<br />
<br />
Compañeras and Compañeros, "Green Technologies and Technology”, Competitions in Schools, Universities and Technology Centers. All this from the Cooperation and the team of Organizations, Entities, Social Movements, so that we dedicate ourselves to working on the protection of our Mother Earth.</p>

<p>We also have, Compañeras and Compañeros, renovated Educational Centers, Salomón Ibarra in New Guinea, Concepción de María in Bethlehem, Luz del Recuerdo in New Guinea, delivered to the Educational Community in better conditions.</p>

<p>Also INATEC... Recitals; we are talking about the Commemoration of the Life, the Living Testimony of an Incomparable Revolutionary, Commander Tomás Borge. There are Poetry, Books, Exhibitions, Talks, Festivals, in all the Technical Centers of our Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>We delivered 800 Property Titles in Chinandega, El Realejo, Managua, Corinto, San Carlos, Teustepe, El Castillo, El Paraisito, is a Neighborhood of San Carlos; Wiwilí de Jinotega, San Rafael del Norte, Granada, Ocotal, Jalapa, Rancho Grande, Matiguás, Bonanza, Rosita and Paiwas.</p>

<p>800 Families who receive their Title Deeds accredited and certified as legitimate owners.<br />
<br />
Also in the Community of La Paz del Tuma, in the El Pantheon Sector, we inaugurated Electricity today for more than 70 Brothers and Sisters. And the Public Lighting System restored and in perfect condition that have been handed over on the Ostional Highway and in Tortuga, San Juan del Sur, Rivas, for 670 Protagonists; and Chichigalpa, Chinandega, for 46,229 Protagonists.</p>

<p>So there we are, Compañeras and Compañeros, attentive so that tomorrow Peace will continue to shine Beautifully throughout the Country, in our Sky, that Blue and White Sky that the enemies of Peace could not tarnish, Clear and Immense. That's what we are!</p>

<p>The Will of God is the Will of the People, and the Will of the People, which is the Will of God, is clearly expressed in this Life, expressed in this Life as the way of living, of working, of enjoying, of recreating ourselves, of feeling intensely the Joy that we have in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The Will of God, which is the Will of the People, and the Will of the People, which is the Will of God, is to sanctify Peace every day, to advance, to prosper, and above all to do Justice, via True Truths! And No Repetition... without Amends!</p>

<p>Here the enemies of Peace, the outlaws, the filibusters, will not return! They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They, and We are Going Onward, with the Strength of our History, with the Strength of our Memory, with the Strength of our Glory and with the Infinite Spiritual Strength that God has let flow over this His Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Here we are, and We are indeed Moving Onward, the Future is ours. Tomorrow, from the Plaza de la Fé, connected with the whole country, our Comandante Daniel will pay Tribute to the Nicaraguan People, who love Peace, who want Peace, who build Peace; to the Heroes of all Times; to the Workers, to the Working Families of Nicaragua who are All of Us, in all the Economic Modalities that we are developing in this Blessed Nation of ours, and paying tribute to Comandante Tomás, one of our Founders, and as we said, an Incomparable Militant.</p>

<p>Let's Go Onward, Comrades, Always Further On..! The future is ours. Always and Always, Further On...! The future is Ours! Warm embraces.</p>
