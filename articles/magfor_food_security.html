launches innovative program to assist communities facing food

      <br>
To avoid a situation of food insecurity in certain parts
of rural Nicaragua over the coming months the Agriculture Ministry
(MAGFOR) together with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
and World Food Program (WFP) recently began implementing an innovative
program to assist the communities worst affected by last year's drought.<br>
      <br>
All of Central America suffered varying degrees of drought during the
second half of last year's rainy season as a result of El Niño -
a
cyclical climatic phenomenon which significantly reduces rainfall in
Latin America. Compared to neighbouring countries like Honduras,
Guatemala and El Salvador, however, Nicaragua, is not faced with the
threat of a national
food shortage. This is mainly thanks to the FSLN government's
prioritization of agricultural production by small and medium sized farmers.<br>
      <br>Despite false claims by the country's corporate media (whose owners are
passionately opposed to President Daniel Ortega's government), the threat of famine does not exist in Nicaragua. But, as
MAGFOR confirms, a number of subsistence farming families from
rural communities in 36 of the country's 153 municipalities are facing local food shortages
after having lost most&nbsp; of their harvests due to the lack of
rain.<br>
      <br>
After carrying out a locally coordinated census in the affected
municipalities (which all fall within the deforested central and
northern Pacific part
of Nicaragua in the departments of Managua, Boaco, Matagalpa, Esteli,
Leon, Chinandega, Madriz and Nueva Segovia), MAGFOR has established
which communities require food security assistance over the coming
months. Currently MAGFOR plans to assist approximately 50,000 people
within the worst affected communities (this is on top of the 200,000
rural Nicaraguans who are already involved in longer term WFP food
security programs).<br>
      <br>
The assistance program basically involves providing with basic
foodstuffs in return for work on different projects in their own
community. The local organizations (CPC, cooperative or other) will
decide which specific projects should be carried out although the
projects chosen should be aimed at reducing the community's
vulnerability to future droughts, for example reforestation of water
sources, sinking of new wells, soil conservation activities or
implementation of drip irrigation systems.<br>
      <br>
Additional funds and other forms of input to make these projects
possible including technical assistance are being made available from
different sources including the Rural Development Institute (IDR) and
local government, while MAGFOR, WFP and FAO are guaranteeing the food
with which farmers are being paid for their work. The families assisted
by this program will also be provided with the inputs they require in
order to plant crops when the rains come in May. <br>
      <br>
Pedro Haslam, President of IDR, spoke to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tortilla con Sal </span>about the FSLN
government's efforts to mitigate climate change in rural Nicaragua in <a href="../tortillaconsal.com/pedro_haslam_en2.html">an interview</a>
in November. He explained that: <br>
      <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">the issue of
food handouts is very delicate for the [FSLN] government because
we don't want to create more dependency among the population on
programs or institutions. ...<br>
      <br>
When I say that we are working to reinstate
people's dignity what I mean is that the government knows that people
feel good if they are producing their own food.&nbsp; .. We work to
create sustainability for people with regards to their
ability
to establish a productive base, even if that base is very small. The
important thing is that it is their productive base which will
guarantee, if tomorrow the
World Food Program doesn't turn up, that they can produce their own
food. ...<br>
      <br>
The crisis provoked by climate change isn't just going to affect us
once. Like I said earlier, the cycles are increasingly short. So we
need to get these communities producing food. We need to help people
generate life in their communities. It's not that we have all the
resources we need to solve everyone's problems but at least we are
working to solve specific problems in specific areas. <br>
      </div>
      <br>
In that same interview, Haslam described the government's efforts to
ensure record production levels during the third bean harvest of the
2009/10 agricultural cycle in order to guarantee a sufficient amount of
beans for the national market over the coming months. Those government
efforts paid off. Agriculture Minister Ariel Bucardo announced recently
that more than enough beans to satisfy the national demand have been
produced and that Nicaragua, as happens most years, will look to export
excess produce to El Salvador, Venezuela and the US. <br>
      <br>
Also as a result of government efforts during the third crop cycle of
2009/10, MAGFOR is able to guarantee that the national demand for seeds
will be satisfied when the rains come in three months time. Normally
after significant drought hits, a large proportion of subsistent
farmers struggle to find seed with which to plant crops at the
beginning of the next agricultural cycle. <br>
      <br>
The figure of approximately 50,000 people facing imminent
food insecurity should be placed in the context of the severe drought
provoked by El Niño, which has caused crisis conditions across much of
Central and South America. The situation would be much worse without
the dramatic transformation of domestic agricultural production under
the FSLN government since 2007. After the FSLN came to power three
years ago corn and
bean production have greatly increased while rice production has
more than doubled. Hundreds of thousands of farming families have
received very favourable credits for food production and nearly 50,000
families have been included in the successful "Zero Hunger" food
production and poverty reduction&nbsp;
program.&nbsp; <br>
