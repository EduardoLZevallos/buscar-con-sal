<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">A very good afternoon, Compañera, a very good afternoon Beloved Families of this proud, dignified Nicaragua of Ours... A Nicaragua grateful to God every day, recognizing God's great power and, for that reason, from the spiritual strength God's great power gives us, within each one of us, we make our way, strengthening the paths of Common Good, of Right. And how much Right, how much Merit the Nicaraguan People have.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And while the enemies of Peace are always speaking against the rights of the Nicaraguan People, against the justice that Nicaragua's Families deserve: A Good Life, a Life with rights, that healthy, lively, cheerful, industrious Life we Nicaraguans live, a great, Christian, Socialist, Solidarity oriented People... A People of affection, a traditionally harmonious People, a People where, so as to prevent us being the way we are, foreign interference has favored, created, generated and multiplied conflicts, but they have not prevailed!</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">We are a People of affection, a People of harmony, a People of faith, of devotion, a People that recognizes, I repeat, God's great Power. And because we know how to recognize the Great Power of God, we know very well that everything depends on Him: Health for each one of us. Without God, what are we? With God, we can do everything...! God who is Love, the Love that overcomes, able to do anything and everything! So, in this Nicaragua of Yours, this People of God is Going Onward!</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">45/19, the Triumph of the Rights of Nicaragua's Families, the Victory of the possibility of securing the Rights of Everyone, by and for Everyone. The Victory of Democracy!</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">When we hear a few liars, after all that's what they are, stateless liars, talking about Nicaragua, we see that they live in another Country: the Country they always preferred throughout history, being servants of Empire, able only to smear and denigrate with hatred and yet more hatred. Well in fact God's great power is against hatred and clears it out, banishes it. He defeats it. That's how it is.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And here, persisting always every day, always sure that here we are illuminated, and I repeat the word here, for we are illuminated by a Sun that does not set, and we know that the Heavenly Father is our Sun, and we know He is always there to strengthen us, and in the face of difficult, adverse circumstances, to give us the Strength to transcend.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Here we are illuminated by Almighty God the Father, the Sun which does not set! And in fact, Hatred, Evil, has been displaced and become more and more distant, such that here we are, as People, as Human Beings, who know how to face up to the tough moments of difficulty, moments where human wretchedness may prevail, moments where the wretched have thought they could defeat the Strong Souls. But we all know They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They, and we know we can celebrate, as we continue to celebrate, the triumphs of Peace, the culture of Peace, the triumphs of Affection, and the triumphs of the Immense Spiritual Strength we Nicaraguans have.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This is how we are, making our way always full of Hope and always working for Good, for the Common Good. And as human beings also knowing how to confront the temptations we see along the way, the crossroads, the turning points, but knowing how to receive and listen to the Voice of God, so as to continue along the Path which all of us, in Fraternal Union, want, need and deserve... the Paths of Goodness!</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So here we are, Comrades, celebrating another Triumph of Health. The funding with 386 million 250,000 Saudi Riyals, which has been guaranteed for the departmental hospital of the Las Minas region.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">How I remember when Evil sought to impose itself here, when Hatred sought to sweep away Love, when Hatred wanted to burn down all the Good Works, how they wanted to stop all these Projects, and even went so far as to hold up the Hospital in Bilwi, for example. It was held up! But there it continues, and is already about to be concluded, and it is now going to give the best possible service to all the Afro-descendant Families and the Original Communities living in that Region.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Imagine how malign of heart some People are, to try stopping a Hospital from being built for the Original Communities and for all the inhabitants of the area, in other words, preventing the promotion and guarantee of the Right to Health. Who can believe such really evil deceivers?</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And today the financing from Saudi Arabia has been signed, been approved, our recognition goes to the several delegations that have come to bring this about, building a first-class hospital, where we are going to ensure care in 310 beds, which is the number of beds this hospital will have, with all the X-ray equipment, intensive care, transfusion medicine, all the first-class services and accompanying specializations.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">In other words, a first-class hospital! Thanks to whom? To our People of God, the Nicaraguan People. Because all these Triumphs, as we always insist, are of the People, they come from the dedication, the commitment, the labor of the People, like the Good Life that we deserve in all its Goodness. Peace and Well Being said St. Francis of Assisi. Peace and Well Being is what we have and what we want as we make our way step by step, building the Future.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">A Victorious People... A People moving forward... A People making their Way... A People who sing, A people who celebrate... A People full of Joy and Triumphant Energy... The People of Darío, of Zeledón, of Sandino... The People of Nicarao, of Diriangén, of Adiact... The People of Andrés and José Dolores Estrada...</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The People, our People, a People with so many Heroes who have left us but have bequeathed to us the Duty to Sing, which is the Duty to Go Onward, the Duty to Build... And never destroy! The Duty to be exceptional human beings, because we can be... Exceptional in a World so complex and full of Hatred, so full of Maleficence, so full of War, so full of all those things we do not want in these Lands of Ours when they can be full of Love, of Construction, of Achievements, of Victories.</p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">God wants us to emerge from these disastrous Times of Darkness the World is living thrpough, for Light to shine again, namely Life with Security, which is a Right, which is Justice, which is Genuine Truth, for Peoples everywhere.</p>
