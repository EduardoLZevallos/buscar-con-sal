<i><a href="http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/blogs/2845/el-feminismo-chatarra-y-la">http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/blogs/2845/el-feminismo-chatarra-y-la</a>..</i>.<br />
<br />
<img height="475" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario81.jpg.html" style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="350" />Feminism set out to be a proposal of justice. The distortion of feminism, the manipulation of its banners, the deformation of its content, the deployment of its arguments for the cause of evil in the world, is, unquestionably, an act of treason, one treacherous and cruel for the true interests, personal and collective of women, which are hijacked by petty ambitions, and perverse political agendas.<br />
<br />
Feminism, on the right and on the left, has been manipulated and distorted, to the extent that from its banners, which could have contributed so much to recovering women's rights, alarming feminicidal tendencies have been promoted and continue to be promoted, which objectify and seek to obliterate women, political adversaries above all, departing from attitudes typical of the most crude and recalcitrant patriarchal right wing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Frivolity, falsehood, cultural domination</strong><br />
<br />
This false feminism, of false prophets and priestesses, necessarily does not do us justice. On the contrary. It hunts us down and pursues us, to set us on fire like some official tribunal of the Inquisition, except that today the bonfire is via the media, as appropriate in these postmodern times, of image, frivolity and entertainment. Of invasion and cultural domination, moreover.<br />
<br />
Feminism, which aspired to be a route towards women's rights, if postulated as a human and inclusive feminism, degenerated until it became just one more pawn of the Empire, which deploys it in its well-coordinated articulated programs and "perfect" operations, of political chess, to discredit, divide, and allegedly win.<br />
<br />
Inclusive feminism promotes human values. False feminism beats the drums of war against all human values. It is an instrument of political and cultural penetration and occupation. Stripped of its liberating mission, false feminism has reached the extreme, in Nicaragua, of marching in favor of social oppression, shoulder to shoulder with the phalanxes of capital, and with the most notorious exponents of a querulous and brutal machismo.<br />
<br />
False feminism serves the model of neocolonization; it lives in perfect tune with imperial designs. It plays a key role in the strategy of wearing down revolutionary projects. In the language of its most intelligent analysts, this is dubbed "struggle for freedom and democracy"; "struggle against dictatorships", or white marches.<br />
<br />
For us this is nothing new. We have known it, suffered from it and overcome it; it is called counter-revolution.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rlp680/files/uploads/2020/09/11/combi1.jpg" style="height:600px; width:600px" /></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Cults that are oligarchic instruments</strong><br />
<br />
Evil designs its low-intensity wars, which today are fundamentally media, political, of manufactured street performances, facing a lack of reception or welcome among the peoples victimized by its nefarious campaigns. Its executors are the rich and egocentric oligarchic classes, who thus seek to defend their economic interests and their evil political model. They organize their sects, or "peaceful" arms and call them "civil societies"; they create "smart", "politically correct" movements manipulating just causes; they march against "authoritarianism" and "tyranny" serially prefabricated, all cut out with the same scissors and pattern.<br />
<br />
Evil usurps banners, uniting castes, adding resentments, perverting, trying to divide us, shooting to kill any project of true social justice that arises. It on this hook of false democracy that false feminism is proclaimed by its well-remunerated priestesses of news cameras and the Press. It should be noted that some of these are of sinister personal trajectory, with an even darker professional and political resumé. There are those, even here in Nicaragua, who are twinned with the darkest and most fearsome figures of the criminal Somocista National Guard, and they are perfect exponents of that essence, and of its external, bloodthirsty and brutal counterparts.<br />
<br />
That false feminism, political usurper of struggles and emblems, has turned mental illness, frustration, and mythomaniacal and personal vengeance into a "cause" that fills pages of news and front page headlines, for which over many years now there have been abundant psychological, sociological and political explanations.<br />
<br />
<strong>Schizophrenic Pathology</strong><br />
<br />
Entrenched in the recalcitrant and immoral right, the feminists in black, instigated, conspired, created and appropriated some schizophrenic pathology, to promote pornography and anti-values, which they have taken it upon themselves to disseminate throughout the world, doing the dirty work of the right wing "castes" and their "puritanical" imperial master.<br />
<br />
Via their electronic tyrannies, the agents of mischief have unleashed unprecedented political terrorism against leadership, honor, reputation, and the most basic human dignity of individuals and entire families. Their political calculation, their eagerness to be seen as leaders, their vengeful mentality as daughters of the local oligarchy, their faithful service to the imperial, European and American flags have opened doors and gates for them into every arena of struggle between good and evil, between Revolution and Counter-Revolution, between progress and poverty, between creative peace and devastation.<br />
<br />
In their disturbed eagerness for political destruction and family disintegration, the oligarchies have stopped at nothing. They have no scruples or heart, to be moved by tender children, or adolescent girls, who are attacked and violated, precisely in the name of their increasingly fallacious "campaign against violence". Let's remember that in every family under attack, there are girls and boys, innocent and fragile, who receive without deserving it, an incessant onslaught of the meanest ambition, the cruellest envy and the most primitive hatred.<br />
<br />
This political and cultural activism, pro-European and pro-American, disguises itself as "feminism", wears women's clothes, but does not know, has never known, the sensitivity of women's hearts. Its language is visceral and vengeful, typical of the selfishness and egocentricity that characterize deep capitalism. Its rationale, rapacious and calculating, joyfully via well equipped laptops, racks up ever more hired help income for services rendered to the cause of Capital.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rlp680/files/uploads/2020/09/11/combi2.jpg" style="height:768px; width:600px" /></p>

<p><strong>Dirty, media and perverse war</strong><br />
<br />
The anti-values offensive, managed by this so-called feminism, is a miserable manipulation of all too many just claims of women, and today takes on, as part of its political agenda, waging an ideological and cultural war of decomposition and "mass destruction", pitting woman against woman. These are the typical maneuvers of distraction or ideological diversionism, as we call it, within the general logic of a dirty, perverse media war, with self-evident purposes.<br />
<br />
We are facing political prostitution, with a macho goat's voice and an Uncle Sam's hat. We face permanent provocation, also taking advantage of their role as political operators promoting "rights", and using the spaces their wealthy families open up for them, to try and change the scale of cultural values by imposing foreign, extraneous social norms on our family and community coexistence.<br />
<br />
They want to decide for us how we should think, speak, live, love, eat, sleep, work, and walk; they want to dictate our lives, denying us precisely the right to speak and live. To use our intelligence, to have our own thoughts becomes a crime, unless we accept their dictates and laws; to live as women, with creativity, generosity and a woman's spirit, not a man's, nor an undefined or unacceptable condition, is another crime.<br />
<br />
They castigate the left for being "macho, national socialist, and Hitlerite"... but they join the worst fascists in proudly marching, together with sexist bullies and raving maniacs crying out for democracy but oozing political intolerance. They claim freedom, but they curtail freedoms; they deny religion and God himself, calling them "authoritarian" and "patriarchal". Like true "authoritarian" and "patriarchal" deities, they accuse, and harass everyone who lives by faith. They present their backers with a hefty bill for something that in fact comes naturally to them, rejecting God, hating men, mocking other women, despising mothers and decrying families. In fact, they describe all this as denouncing abuses by the "Confessional State", while they themselves abuse anyone who who wants no truck with them, nor interest in sharing their mercenary  profits.<br />
<br />
They proclaim abortion, without respect for the culture and the collective soul of the people... They criminally attack those who dare to unmask them as political agents of the right wing, and at the same time they dress up that right wing as liberating modernity while condemning the Left as archaic oppression.<br />
<br />
<strong>Leaders in mendacity</strong><br />
<br />
In this political-cultural war they are promoting in the name of women, they try selling their stereotypes as political postmodernity, promoting their imported foreign culture, one alien to our idiosyncrasy, and one that is also part of a failed cultural model, one destructive of the world, which creates deprived souls, and enthroning selfishness, loneliness and deep emptiness. Leaders in mendacity, they want to sell us as an ideal the model of worship to the Golden Calf.<br />
<br />
In this world ruled by consumption and fierce competition, human beings lose their natural bonds and, above all, their capacity to feel, receive and give affection. In that world, the perfect mirror of its deformations, humanity is reduced, eaten away by excess, individualistic complacency and waste... With this model they have already destroyed the Earth and have us all, planet and species, on the way to extinction.<br />
<br />
That is why we say that their political values represent the old society, exclusive, unjust and impoverishing that the world's peoples have been tearing down. That is why we argue that their moral ideals also belong to that decrepit, egomaniacal world, where men and women, unrepentant and unsupportive, prefer to rear pets instead of raising children, and to depopulate and disharmonize the Earth.<br />
<br />
This is junk "feminism", subjugated under the boots of the Empire. And it is, moreover, as I said, managed by women who neither live as women nor know the female soul, individual or collective. They ignore our daily battles; they are not the flesh and blood of women; they have no stable family or affective ties; they disdain those happy and blessed bonds of unconditional love, indispensable for healthy human development.<br />
<br />
<strong>Totalitarian and exclusive</strong><br />
<br />
Favourites of "exclusive" perfumed democracy, they are skilful at mixing politics and sexism, like totalitarian, dogmatic judges, recognizing only their own models, their special options for coexistence, their criteria of passion and their political predilections. Their voracious obsession prevents them from noting that most women recognize themselves as women and want to live and build, as women, with men, our partners, our children, our brothers in struggle, in community, as a nation, and in the world, a humanity without hatred or blasphemy.<br />
<br />
In the revolutionary and progressive processes of Latin America, we women have been conquering spaces of power. We have taken on our true demands of justice and equity, working with soul, for a political, economic and social practice that incorporates us in all our cultural diversity, and in our essential freedom. And that, precisely, is what irritates the despotic imperial watchdogs the most.<br />
<br />
They do not allow that we women may choose constructive paths as women, with an inclusive conscience, maternal instinct and sense of family, partnership and human brotherhood. They do not admit that men and women create a different possible future, working together, creating the indispensable difference between today and tomorrow. They do not tolerate that we have and defend our idiosyncrasies, values and customs, which are precisely those that throughout history have allowed humanity to love, share, multiply, dream and work for a better society. They call us retrograde; they demonize us; they make us a favorite target of their vengeful passion, because we do not share their right-wing agenda or their social paths.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rlp680/files/uploads/2020/09/11/combi3.jpg" style="height:768px; width:600px" /></p>

<p><strong>Sad, resentful and frustrated women</strong><br />
<br />
The empire and the right wing skillfully use their resentments and frustrations to articulate them into very well paid networks and movements serving counterrevolutionary interests. These sad women are a suitable political instrument for these purposes, because their disturbed emotionality and their inexhaustible desire for protagonism, prepare them, precisely, to serve as a counter-revolutionary media, ideological and cultural front, designed for calculated outrage, generating social "scandal", and good at handling efficiently a mixture of counter-culture and political positions, ideal for diversionism, and publicity seeking spectacle, using the media above all.<br />
<br />
That's why it's obligatory to denounce it!<br />
<br />
Because it is a matter of life and death.<br />
<br />
Because it is one more battle, against a failed model.<br />
<br />
Because, in addition, opposing them is to defend our values against being denatured, to defend a better world for humanity.<br />
<br />
They will march, they will march... they will continue to use pornography and electronic terrorism to intimidate.<br />
<br />
But the truth is that their message does not sit well. People clearly identify it for what it is: politicized sexism, served up on golden plates of empire. Because it is hatred. Of sex and class. Because it is hatred of life. Because it is also anti-cultural,  a message of personal and family destruction. Because it is a culture of annihilation... I denounce it!<br />
<br />
Nicaragua cannot return to the era of warriors and endless crossfire. The gangsters may attack, but we are not going to traffic with peace. Nor with the dignity of anyone. Nicaragua wants work and peace. That is why we are going to respond to this cultural occupation with political dignity.<br />
<br />
We denounce them from our values. We confront them with civilization, prayer, faith, moral strength, with spiritual greatness... with culture! We will pray for them.<br />
Love is stronger than hate.<br />
<br />
We will pray for their personal fulfilment; we will pray they move from the frustration that suffocates and unnerves them, to peace of mind; and we will ask that this calm leads them to recognize what is good, and incorporate it into their lives.<br />
<br />
We will not poison our hearts. We do not carry lethal weapons. We are not made of evil, or rancor. We return good, because we want good. We ask God that Love may be manifested in their lives, and that its power may overcome hatred.<br />
<br />
From the heart, Lord, we ask this; amen . Let it be!<br />
