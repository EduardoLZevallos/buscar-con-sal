after the Ceremony in Tribute to Comandante Carlos Fonseca<br />
and Promotions in Grade to General Commissioners of the National Police</b></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>June 23rd 2025</b></span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/426594.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Good evening. In these difficult times... As Charles Chaplin said in his film Modern Times. Is this modernity?  I don't doubt it. Modernity should be the construction of a Better World, a Just, Supportive, Fraternal, Complementary World; but this is the Modernity that Powerful countries make prevail in the World.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And our Peoples and Countries, who have come from so much Struggle, from so much Memorable History, know this is not the Modernity we want. We as Combative Peoples want Justice, to live peacefully, to live safely, to work and prosper, that is what we all want to ensure, united, all Nicaragua’s Families, because it is together that we have to Go Onward.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">When we see the difficulties, the risks, the threats, the follies, we talk about climatic madness, we talk about political madness, social madness, and above all the madness of greed, the madness of supremacy, of authoritarianism, of the desire to dominate.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">We talk of this, and we see how the whole world suffers from these follies, although here, thanks be to God, we have Peace which we defend and protect as we make our way towards the Future, with Faith and Hope, because that is our Christian Faith. But we know that all those insane deviations which we see, which we know affect Peoples around the World, especially those Peoples in a global economy of rising prices and so many risks of mortality.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Comandante Daniel has already explained how atrocious crimes with atomic weapons developed. That is why we say that these are moments of grave danger, because when the tens of millions of victims occurred in the Second World War, there were still no nuclear bombs. Now there are nuclear weapons and we are all more exposed to a global catastrophe.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So what remains to us? To work hard with Hope; to sustain ourselves from the Strength of Spirit that characterizes us, from Faith, and to preserve Peace. Peace in Unity. The Peace to prosper, step by step. The Peace to recognize and understand one other among Peoples who have faith and who know that Truth, Justice and the Right of Everyone to live safely and peacefully must prevail.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And for that we must contribute, for that we must work hard in International Forums and contribute to that dream: The refounding, the reinvention of the United Nations, so that it serves the world’s Peoples and so that from that Body we can really defend all our Rights.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">I always listened to the theories, the ideas of Father Miguel d’Escoto, who dreamed of a reinvented, refounded United Nations, serving the Right of Peoples to Justice, to the Truth, and to stop the wars, the conflicts, the tribulations, that we ourselves cause through the deadly sins. I mean we, as a Human Family, as a planetary Community.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Today, also Father's Day, at midday I referred to a topic I know is delicate and sensitive, especially for Families, where we have to recognize that we still need to work hard for the Responsibility of Parents, to their children, to the Family.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And we not only intend to continue working, but to continue convincing each other, because it remains to convince, the work is to convince everyone of the responsibilities we all have for the Women and Men of the Future, to be raised in a loving, generous environment, a responsibility of the whole Family, obviously, so that they will also, we all hope, create a Better World.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And we can never forget Comandante Carlos, not only on June 23</span><sup><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">rd</span></sup><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">, not only on November 8th to recall his Legacy with enthusiasm and turn that Legacy into a Path and Commitment to Victories every single day. Today, we not only evoke his presence, remember him, recognize him, but we are proud, he said at noon, of his Leadership.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Carlos was a Leader! In addition, as a Human Being, I did not know him personally, but those who had the privilege and honor of knowing him, always refer to him as an exceptional, extraordinary Human Being, who knew how to work at all times also to bring together the personalities, the ways of being of the Compañeros of the Frente Sandinista.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And when we lived the pain of his loss, we also knew that until the very last moment he had given all his encouragement, all his strength, in addition, all his Faith and trust in the Revolutionary People of Nicaragua and in the Revolution that was coming, inspired, obviously, by extraordinary, formidable Beings, like Carlos.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Here we are then, seeing, living in this World that seems unreal; but no, it is all too real. What is unreal are the tales they tell us. Those tales they want us to believe. But we also already know how to look beyond their words, so as to see the intentions, the purposes, and to learn from the History of Humanity.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left">And also to learn from what we know to be our vices as humanity, and above all the desire for domination, that uncontrollable desire to be superior, or to appear superior, which had its maximum expression in Nazism, which was defeated and, therefore, we cannot as Humanity allow it to return in any way.</p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Human Beings have to learn how to live together on this Planet God has given us all, and where the Teachings of Christ Jesus were clear: To love one another. What does that mean? To know how to live together, to share, and to be not only Brothers and Sisters, but to live in Solidarity, promoting Justice and Peace.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So here we are, Compañer@s, one more year of Eternal Life of Comandante Carlos, the Leader of our Revolution, in times taking us Always Further On, in Victories, in Struggles, in unchanging Conviction, and Victories. We are irrevocably Revolutionary and Optimistic.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Once, while talking with Comandante Fidel, he gave me his latest book and autographed it. He wrote, ”From an unyielding Optimist." That optimism should characterize us all, because we have to believe, and we have the Faith and the Strength of Spirit to believe and to know that We are Going Onward, Always that 19th and Always Further On, Compañeras and Compañeros.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The world has to change, for another World is not only possible, but necessary and indispensable.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">A warm embrace to all our Nicaraguan families. We embrace you!</span></p>
