and Chairman of the Production, Economy and Budget Commission,</strong></em></h3>

<h3><em><strong>with Patricia Villegas of TELESUR News<br />
<br />
July 15, 2021</strong></em></h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Journalist Patricia Villegas</strong><br />
 <br />
Let's start immediately with our analysis, for this we are accompanied by Wálmaro Gutiérrez, who is a Congressman, President of the Production, Economy and Budget Commission of the National Assembly of Nicaragua. Congressman, good evening, welcome.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Remarks by Congressman Wálmaro Gutiérrez</strong><br />
 <br />
Good evening, thank you very much, a Fraternal and Revolutionary Greeting from the Land of Sandino to the Land of Bolivar. Thank you very much to telesur for giving us the opportunity to speak and have the opportunity to get in direct contact with our Latin American Sisters and Brothers.</p>

<p><strong>Journalist Patricia Villegas</strong><br />
 <br />
Thank you very much Congressman for joining us. First, I will ask for an initial analysis of the results of this poll published by the private company M&amp;R Consultants, three and a half months before the elections, on two figures that are quite clear: 43.2% have a hard vote in favor of the FSLN, and in total the party would add more than 60%, taking into account the other variables. What’s your opinion about that?</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Congressman Wálmaro Gutiérrez</strong></p>

<p>Well, in principle, we as the Sandinista National Liberation Front, and from the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, recognize and value, as far as possible, the enormous support of the Nicaraguan People, for the administration of President-Comandante Daniel Ortega and Comrade Rosario Murillo, who for 15 consecutive years, since 2007 and until this date, has not by coincidence prioritized the Restitution of the Rights of the Nicaraguan People, and the systematic reduction of Poverty and Extreme Poverty.</p>

<p>If you notice, from 2007 to date, we as Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, have faced the only enemy we have in this country, which is Poverty and Extreme Poverty.</p>

<p>When we took over the Government in this country, we had 48% of General Poverty and 16.7% of Extreme Poverty; at this time, Thank God, we have been reducing that Poverty, from 48% to less than 24% regarding general poverty, and extreme poverty, from 16.7% to less than 7.5%.</p>

<p>This is the result of Restituting Rights, where access to free and quality health care, free and quality education, the strengthening of our Productive Infrastructure, support for the Productive Sectors with credit to the Agricultural Sector; and something fundamental, which is Citizen Security, both in the Rural Areas and in the Cities, something that is highly valued by the Nicaraguans.<br />
 <br />
Therefore, we believe that we have made progress in fulfilling our commitments to the Nicaraguan people, because the Sandinista Front does not make promises, the Sandinista Front makes committments, and fulfills them as it has done to date. And it is a consequence of that, Thank God, that we can enjoy the results of this most recent M&amp;R Survey. We are talking about a predisposition to vote in favor of the Sandinista National Liberation Front of 62.8%; 60.7% are talking about how they would do better with a government like the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, and more than 60.4% of Nicaraguans believe that the country would continue along the path of economic growth with Social Justice, with a government of the Sandinista National Liberation Front.</p>

<p><strong>Journalist Patricia Villegas</strong><br />
 <br />
Congressman, this poll comes out, this results are published at a time of a very strong onslaught by the media, let's say hegemonic, media corporations inside and outside the country. What about this attempt at creating a matrix of opinion that says that everything is wrong in Nicaragua, starting with actions that go against the people by the government of President Daniel Ortega? Is something wrong with them? Because if we see this result, it doesn't match that attempt to install such an opinion matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Congressman Wálmaro Gutiérrez</strong></p>

<p>Indeed, I believe that the result of this most recent Survey of a Firm as prestigious as M&amp;R, the only thing that this ends up proving is that the narrative fed by the International Media, which is generating or intends to generate a distorted state of opinion, has simply failed, and the Nicaraguan People have forcefully unmasked them.<br />
 <br />
Because, if his narrative really coincides with the reality that Nicaraguans are living in this country, the Government of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, would not have a popular support greater than 62.8% and this without even starting the Electoral Campaign.<br />
 <br />
We are not yet in the Electoral Campaign, nor have we registered the candidates of the different Political Parties that will participate in the next Electoral Process. So those are the compelling realities that this Survey demonstrates.</p>

<p><strong>Journalist Patricia Villegas</strong><br />
 <br />
Does this begin, Congressman, on July 28, the Registration of Candidates? Is that the date it would start, July 28th?</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Congressman Wálmaro Gutiérrez</strong><br />
 <br />
Effectively.<br />
<br />
<strong>Journalist Patricia Villegas</strong></p>

<p>Well, there are still a few days to know precisely this panorama with regard to which Political Movements and Parties will register their Candidates for President, Vice-Presidential Formula and Deputies, in addition also for the Central American Parliament.</p>

<p>Congressman, there is a figure that also draws attention, presented today by M&amp;R, this Private Polling Company: 42.6% marked the Blank Box when asked specifically who to vote for. There they raised different interpretations, one of them is that some people decided not to count who they would vote for and that is why 46.2% is reflected. What is your opinion?</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by Congressman Wálmaro Gutiérrez</strong></p>

<p>We believe that the results generated in this poll, first, demonstrate the massive popular support that the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity and the Sandinista National Liberation Front have as a Political-Partisan Institution; second, it is natural, if you consider previous Electoral Processes, that a segment of the populace does not publicly and openly express their electoral intentions, a large percentage, above 50%, always ends up choosing to support the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Therefore, we would not be surprised if this 47% of hard votes, currently being expressed in favor of the FSLN, climbs significantly above 55% or 57%.</p>

<p><strong>Journalist Patricia Villegas</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much Congressman, for those remarks, good evening.<br />
