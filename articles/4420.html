<p>How can it be that many solidarity activists and progressives believe the current unrest in Nicaragua represents a popular, broad based movement for democracy against the brutal and repressive Ortega dictatorship; while some others believe that this has been a well orchestrated, right wing coup attempt financed by the U.S.</p>

<p>To understand what is really happening, I decided to compare what a similar situation to the political unrest in Nicaragua would be like in the U.S.  For this comparison, let’s assume that Hillary Clinton had actually beaten Trump.</p>

<p>It would be like President Clinton announcing social security reforms<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc" id="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a></sup> which protect worker’s benefits and which reject corporate America’s (Wall Street) more neoliberal proposal which would have eliminated benefits, increased the retirement age, and doubled the number of weeks workers would have needed to work to qualify for benefits.</p>

<p>It would be like corporate America organizing student protests<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc" id="sdendnote2anc"><sup>ii</sup></a></sup> over the Clinton government’s social security reforms which are described on social media as cuts to benefits and increased contributions for workers.</p>

<p>It would be like Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street and other civil society and media groups joining the protests, with these organizations having received over 1.5 billion dollars<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc" id="sdendnote3anc"><sup>iii</sup></a></sup> in grants from the Russian government for “democracy and human rights promotion”.</p>

<p>It would be like the Green Party<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote4sym" name="sdendnote4anc" id="sdendnote4anc"><sup>iv</sup></a></sup>, having long been frustrated by the Democratic Party for abandoning the middle and working class, deciding to join this protest movement. The Green party has long been critical of President Clinton and the Democratic Party accusing them of being neoliberal, having close ties to Wall Street and corporate America and of no longer representing a real progressive option to the Republican Party. </p>

<p>It would be like, in an inexplicable, crazy turn of events, corporate America, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street and the Green Party all come together and form the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy. </p>

<p>It would be like the Koch Brothers<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote5sym" name="sdendnote5anc" id="sdendnote5anc"><sup>v</sup></a></sup> actually arriving at the first protest, standing on top of a their vehicle, waving a US flag and pledging their full and continued support!</p>

<p>It would be like in order to overthrow the Clinton government, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street and the Green Party using the Russian government funding to carry out a massive and coordinated, social media campaign<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote6sym" name="sdendnote6anc" id="sdendnote6anc"><sup>vi</sup></a></sup> with thousands of fake profiles, sponsored Facebook ads, and thousands of WhatsApp messages, that distorted facts and included a false report<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote7sym" name="sdendnote7anc" id="sdendnote7anc"><sup>vii</sup></a></sup> of a dead student at the first protest; and false reports of a “student massacre” on the second day of protests.</p>

<p>It would be like on the second day of protests, demonstrators also attacking with gunfire and burning several government buildings in several U.S. cities.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote8sym" name="sdendnote8anc" id="sdendnote8anc"><sup>viii</sup></a></sup></p>

<p>It would be like the false reports of a “student massacre” succeeding in drawing out more protesters, including large groups of students at universities and huge marches in several U.S. cities in which several protesters are killed, many with sniper fire.</p>

<p>It would be like President Clinton rescinding the social security reforms after 4 days of protesting, but the protests actually continue, now with the purpose of demanding that Clinton resigns immediately.</p>

<p>It would be like half of the US network television channels and the major newspapers also backing the Civic Alliance and blaming these sniper fire deaths on the Clinton government and the police.  The attacks to government buildings are also blamed on the Clinton government.   </p>

<p>It would be like the social media campaign, within the first days of the protesting, publishing hateful and violence inciting posts and reports, calling the police and President Clinton murderers who are committing genocide on their own people (killing unarmed protesters), and demonizing anyone who supports Hilary Clinton and calling them “bootlickers” and “toadies”. </p>

<p>It would be like anyone who questions why the government would attack and burn their own buildings, or why, since the only reason people are protesting is due to the killing of unarmed protesters, would the Clinton government send out snipers to kill them<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote9sym" name="sdendnote9anc" id="sdendnote9anc"><sup>ix</sup></a></sup>, are also demonized for supporting and defending a brutal regime which blatantly disregards basic human rights.</p>

<p>It would be like students who had been protesting at two public universities, being overtaken by criminal gangs, who take over both universities and began using them as a base in order to commit serious crimes, then ransacking and burning parts of each before leaving<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote10sym" name="sdendnote10anc" id="sdendnote10anc"><sup>x</sup></a></sup>. (U.S. police allow these groups to to happen)</p>

<p>It would be like the students who were overtaken having a press conference<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote11sym" name="sdendnote11anc" id="sdendnote11anc"><sup>xi</sup></a></sup> to denounce these non-student, criminal gangs, and the Civic Alliance who were providing them with weapons and supplies.</p>

<p>It would be like even though there is video footage<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote12sym" name="sdendnote12anc" id="sdendnote12anc"><sup>xii</sup></a></sup> of these armed, criminal elements at the university with members of the Civic Alliance, these students are demeaned and criticized because they were members of a student union affiliated with the Democratic Party. One of the students who participated in the press conference is targeted by the criminal gangs who drag him from his girlfriend’s house, beat him, shoot him three times and them dumped him on the side of the road<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote13sym" name="sdendnote13anc" id="sdendnote13anc"><sup>xiii</sup></a></sup>.</p>

<p>It would be like many of the U.S. media calling on economic sanctions and even military intervention from Russia in order to overthrow Clinton. </p>

<p>It would be like members of the Civic Alliance<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote14sym" name="sdendnote14anc" id="sdendnote14anc"><sup>xiv</sup></a></sup> going to China to push for the passage of the “USA ACT” which would mean China would cancel all loans to the U.S. (This is public knowledge, yet the U.S. government doesn’t issue a warning or pursue treason charges against these Civic Alliance members).</p>

<p>It would be like members of the Civic Alliance participating in a march while holding pictures of protesters who were supposedly killed by police during the protests; but later, several of these people turn up to deny they had been killed<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote15sym" name="sdendnote15anc" id="sdendnote15anc"><sup>xv</sup></a></sup>; and other families turn up to report their loved ones had died in circumstances unrelated to the protests.  </p>

<p>It would be like, after the protests become more violent with protestors attacking schools and health centers, looting stores, and setting up road blocks on several major U.S. highways and in several major U.S. cities, President Clinton decides to call a national dialogue and the Civic Alliance demanding as a precondition to start the dialogue, that the government withdraw the police to their barracks.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote16sym" name="sdendnote16anc" id="sdendnote16anc"><sup>xvi</sup></a></sup></p>

<p>It would be like President Clinton accepting this precondition and the Civil Alliance taking advantage of the absence of the police to strengthen and set up more roadblocks and then begin paying and arming criminal groups to control them<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote17sym" name="sdendnote17anc" id="sdendnote17anc"><sup>xvii</sup></a></sup>.</p>

<p>It would be like, when the dialogue finally begins, the opposition’s sole message is that Clinton must go, with no explanation on what alternative or plan of government they offer.</p>

<p>It would be like the Catholic Church, who was the mediator for the national dialogue, had actually been actively supporting the Civic Alliance. In a private meeting, a group of Bishops hand Hillary Clinton a letter<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote18sym" name="sdendnote18anc" id="sdendnote18anc"><sup>xviii</sup></a></sup> asking for her resignation, and another priest advises<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote19sym" name="sdendnote19anc" id="sdendnote19anc"><sup>xix</sup></a></sup> Clinton for her own good to resign before it is too late, since “we don’t want her, her husband or her children to be killed”</p>

<p>It would be like the Catholic Church supporting the Civic Alliance in their Sunday masses, and even using the Church to hide weapons and armed delinquents who were carrying out crimes at the roadblocks.<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote20sym" name="sdendnote20anc" id="sdendnote20anc"><sup>xx</sup></a></sup></p>

<p>It would be like the Clinton government allowing the roadblocks to halt traffic on major highways and cripple the economy for over 2 months without doing anything for fear of being blamed for repression.</p>

<p>It would be like these roadblocks becoming areas of extreme violence and crime, including kidnapping, torture, murder and even burning people alive<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote21sym" name="sdendnote21anc" id="sdendnote21anc"><sup>xxi</sup></a></sup>. </p>

<p>It would be like, while the Civic Alliance talks about the Clinton Government carrying out genocide; Democrats, Clinton supporters, and police officers are targeted by those running the roadblocks and are kidnaped, tortured and murdered; and some of their homes are burnt down<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote22sym" name="sdendnote22anc" id="sdendnote22anc"><sup>xxii</sup></a></sup>. </p>

<p>It would be like, while the Civic Alliance talks about repression and freedom of speech; Democrats and Clinton supporters, fearful for their lives, disappear from social media and for weeks remain prisoners in their own homes while the roadblocks are up.  Meanwhile, Civic Alliance supporters constantly spread hateful and incendiary social media posts apparently without fear of the “repressive” Clinton “regime”. </p>

<p>It would be like police stations in 2 major U.S. cities being attacked with mortars, Molotov cocktails, and gunfire every day for over a month as the police remain in their barracks on orders from President Clinton to not confront the “protesters”<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote23sym" name="sdendnote23anc" id="sdendnote23anc"><sup>xxiii</sup></a></sup>.</p>

<p>It would be like, after the vast majority of people in the U.S. grow increasingly tired of the roadblocks and begin to realize the violence was actually coming from the Civic Alliance, President Clinton finally decides to order to remove the roadblocks, and, even though it meant more police ended up being wounded, doing so in a careful and strategic way to ensure as few casualties of “protesters” as possible.</p>

<p>It would be like, after the roadblocks are removed and after the delinquents who controlled them were either captured or flee the country, all of the violence subsides (with the exception of several Clinton supporters who are murdered by the opposition in subsequent weeks<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote24sym" name="sdendnote24anc" id="sdendnote24anc"><sup>xxiv</sup></a></sup>).</p>

<p>It would be like, after the roadblocks are removed, people were able to free themselves of the fear they felt during the weeks the roadblocks had held them hostage, and begin to rally to support the Clinton government in huge demonstrations<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote25sym" name="sdendnote25anc" id="sdendnote25anc"><sup>xxv</sup></a></sup> (thousands of people demonstrating several times a week for several weeks in multiple cities—these demonstrations are far larger than those of the Civic Alliance who have lost support as people began to see the violence was coming from them). </p>

<p>It would be like President Clinton inviting the Organization of American States and U.S. and international human rights organizations to investigate and they side with the Civic Alliance, blame the Clinton government for all the deaths (including exaggerating the list of deaths<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote26sym" name="sdendnote26anc" id="sdendnote26anc"><sup>xxvi</sup></a></sup>), and denounce the government for attacking the “peaceful” and “unarmed” protesters at the roadblocks.  The OAS and human rights organizations entirely ignore the police and government institutions evidence of roadblock violence or the violence carried out by those who had taken over the universities.</p>

<p>It would be like the Civic Alliance, opposition media, OAS, and human rights groups after realizing they have lost the battle in the U.S., deciding to carry out a massive international media campaign of misinformation and fake news, including false reports of missing people<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote27sym" name="sdendnote27anc" id="sdendnote27anc"><sup>xxvii</sup></a></sup> and political prisoners<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote28sym" name="sdendnote28anc" id="sdendnote28anc"><sup>xxviii</sup></a></sup>, in order to seek support from Russia and China and calling for sanctions and military intervention, including bringing up the issue at the UN Security Council<sup><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="4420.html#sdendnote29sym" name="sdendnote29anc" id="sdendnote29anc"><sup>xxix</sup></a></sup>.</p>

<p>It is hard to think of any scenario in which even <i>one</i> of these events could actually take place in the U.S., which is why we should wonder how and why it actually did happen in Nicaragua.</p>

The social security reforms that the students were initially protesting didn’t even stand up to critique and hardly posed a threat to the government, since the government’s proposal actually defended the worker’s benefits from the more neoliberal proposal of COSEP and the IMF. By sending out snipers to kill protesters, the administration had everything to lose and absolutely nothing to gain. On the other hand, the opposition, one could argue, had everything to gain with an increase in deaths.</p>
