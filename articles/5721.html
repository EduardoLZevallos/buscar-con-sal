in declarations of the midday edition of Multinoticias, Canal 4<br />
<br />
December 12th 2024</strong></em></h3>

<p>Thank you very much, compañera. Good afternoon, a very good afternoon. Today is a Special Day for today we celebrate 80 Years of our Historic Relationship with the Russian Federation, back then, 80 years ago, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and how during all these years, through all the accidents of history, accidents or incidents, we have victoriously stood together both Countries and Peoples, of course keeping in mind the difference between the great Russian Federation and our Nicaragua, small geographically, but great in Heroism, great in Commitment, in Conviction in Determination, great in Spirit and great too in our Sandinista Popular Revolution.<br />
<br />
80 Years of Relations, working for Peace in the World. 80 Years determined to unite to make Peace a reality because it is always at risk, to make Peace a reality for the Peoples of the World. The Russian Federation has given us great examples today and the Soviet People gave us too, through all those days of Glorious Epics, defending the Right of Humanity to live with Rights precisely, and to live in Peace.<br />
<br />
We feel honored, privileged with these relation over the years and over Time, and which over Time the incidents and coincidences of our Times have reinforced.  Because the Principles and Values remain the same: To Fight for the Unity of Peoples, to strive Courageously for Peace and Security for the Peoples of the World, to strive so that we Peoples can live as we deserve, on Earth as a Paradise, as the Nation of Humanity.<br />
<br />
Honored and proud, and we send special greetings to the Diplomatic Mission of the Russian Federation in Nicaragua, to its Missions contributing in our Nicaragua to the work for Peace, in Health... We are there in Moscow, Laureano is there, Doctor López is there, General Mojica is there, working and consolidating relations of Peace and the Common Good, relations aimed at strengthening Health Care, achieving better conditions, with more science to improve Health Care.<br />
<br />
There too, we are strengthening relations in the field of Education, Science, Culture; strengthening ourselves together in the battles that we continue to give, wherever it is necessary to fight the battle for Peace.<br />
<br />
Every day we repeat: Without Peace, there is nothing! And without Peace, and even more so in these circumstances, in these Times through which the World and Humanity are living, without Peace we are heading for extinction, to our own destruction.<br />
<br />
What an absurd endeavor, to go along thinking only of the destruction of our Planet, because whoever acts against the Common Good, against the Fundamental Interest of Humanity, and against the Rights too of Mother Earth, is set upon destroying the World. It is up to us to think for ourselves and defend building together, which means building the World, the Planet, Humanity, as Brothers and Sisters, sharing and living together with understanding, with Wisdom. Wisdom prevents us from contemplating destruction. Wisdom makes us think, plan and act to build better conditions for all the World's Families .<br />
<br />
There we are...! A lovely event has been held, an Exhibition of Photographs attended by Vice-Chancellor Ryabkov and our Friends there, former Ambassadors... How can we forget the beloved Comrade, now on another Plane of Life, German Shlyapnikov, who was the First Ambassador, at the time of our Nicaragua in Triumphant Revolution, in 1979; also his wife, who was an accomplished soprano, I don't remember her name at the moment, but very beloved, very much appreciated, a great artist, and too all the Ambassadors who have come to Nicaragua strengthening Unity, Cooperation, Respect, Solidarity, precisely to continue building the Future. Not to negate the future.<br />
<br />
And once again, on this Day Celebrating 80 Years of Revolutionary and Evolutionary Brother and Sisterhood, our Recognition, our Respect, our Admiration to the Great Russian People who have been Heroic, unique in the defense of Peace that they continue to maintain and the Right of Humanity to live securely, quiet, working away, sharing the advances of Science, Technologies, Cultures... the Advances of Humanity!<br />
<br />
Our Respect, our Consideration, our Admiration and our Esteem to President Vladimir Putin and to all the Brothers and Sisters of the Government, of the State of the Russian Federation, with whom we share Ideals, we continue to share Ideals, Values, Aspirations, Dreams, everything that represents the Human Right to live, truly, securely, peacefully, progressing in prosperity.<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
In Education... the Rubén Darío School in San Juan de Limay has been improved. And this year the success is that we are closing the 2024 of Victories in Education, with all the Teachers... Among our families I think no one says, did the Educator arrive today? I think rather we say, has the Teacher arrived?  That's a nicer word...!<br />
<br />
When we change for Educator I get the impression that we don't connect with our Culture: The Teacher! The Teacher is a Guide, a Guide in the Community; Educator seems to me more technical. I like to say Teachers, to recognize the Mastery, the Vocation and the Greatness of those who have that Profession, and that Sacred Office of teaching, of showing and also of inculcating, continuing and ensuring the Values and Ideals of our Family Culture, of Community.<br />
<br />
The Teachers of 9,224 Public Educational Centers are now fully qualified, and we are happy and proud, for them and their Families, for having secured that Right. Because the truth is that our Teachers have been Heroic and having achieved their degree qualification, are no longer empirical, beyond the fact that as Teachers theirs is a Sacred Office, as Teachers in fact they were and are Specialists, recognized as inspiring in the Community, and now they all have their formal qualification. They have always been Teachers, Educators, inspiring, great respect in every Community. So I think that is the word we all should all use, Teacher, implying mastery and guidance.</p>
