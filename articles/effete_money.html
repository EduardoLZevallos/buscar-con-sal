global dominance depends on inflating its money and credit to maintain
its military spending. That system has always depended on intimate
collusion between Western Bloc governments, their central banks and
their countries' major financial houses. That is why, against the
interests of the US people, the Obama administration is bailing out
companies like Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs,
J.P.Morgan and Citigroup and helping them
to consolidate by devouring failed rivals like&nbsp;Bear Stearns,
Countrywide, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers or
Wachovia. Western Bloc allies &#8211; European and Pacific country
governments - continue to accept this system as the price they pay to
piggy-back on US imperialism, maintaining their global dominance
without the politically unacceptable price of large militaries. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
current G-20 talks seem to be essentially about how to adapt
long-standing Western Bloc dominance of world affairs and wealth to new
circumstances resulting from the spectacular failure of free-market
capitalism. In Latin America, one important aspect of the recent summit
in Viña del Mar of &#8220;progressive governments&#8221;&nbsp; was an effort by
European members of the dominant Western Bloc to coax cooperation from
Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay for US and European Union
proposals at the G-20 meeting in London (which will include Brazil and
Argentina, as well as Mexico). Immediately after that Viña del Mar
meeting in Chile, US Vice-President Joe Biden met Central American
leaders in Costa Rica.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">That meeting in Costa Rica exposed
several interesting aspects of potential resistance in the majority
world to a recycled Western Bloc imperial system. Scheduled to be a
summit of Central American Presidents, the Costa Rica meeting took
place just five days after the Central American Integration System
summit in Managua, Nicaragua, involving all the Central American
countries (except Costa Rica, whose President Oscar Arias chose not to
attend nor even send a representative) and various observers from
Caribbean nations. It was a crass failure of US State Department
diplomacy to snub that meeting in favour of the event promoted by Costa
Rica's President Arias.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Various sub-plots make up the whole
story, but the underlying theme is regional integration and its
competing versions. Costa Rica has remained aloof from that process in
Central America apart from its somewhat sniffy decision to join
Petrocaribe &#8211; the regional energy framework promoted by Venezuela. All
the Central American countries except El Salvador are members of
Petrocaribe. Honduras and Nicaragua are also members of Petrocaribe's
big sister, the wider regional economic integration initiative ALBA &#8211;
the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Presidents of
both Honduras and Nicaragua refused to attend the meeting with Joe
Biden in Costa Rica. Among other matters, they cited their objection to
the exclusion of Leonel Fernandez, President of the Dominican Republic,
which they regard as a vital player in the region's development.
Fundamentally, they rejected what they regarded as an imposition of the
US government's agenda using the Costa Rican government as a proxy.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
the meeting in Costa Rica could hardly have failed to flop, since it
was so obviously a footnote to what was, for the US, the much more
important meeting in Viña del Mar. That failure to engage with the
Central American integration process made more obvious the option US
diplomacy is developing to counteract the ALBA solidarity-based vision
of regional cooperation and integration promoted by the governments of
Venezuela and Cuba. Essentially, that US government option consists of
a trade-off of regional influence with Brazil. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Brazilian
President Lula da Silva is content to see US influence decline if that
permits Brazil's own regional influence to grow. His Janus-faced policy
allows him to play a double game of cooperation with the Venezuela's
President Chavez and collaboration with whoever happens to be fronting
for the US plutocracy at the moment, currently President Barack Obama.
With the election of Mauricio Funes as President of El Salvador, Brazil
now has a trojan horse inside Central America. Funes, who has openly
stated his alignment with the US and Brazil, is married to the former
representative to El Salvador of President Ignacio da Silva's Workers'
Party. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Central America is an important region both
strategically &#8211; since it is is a crucial transit area for global trade
&#8211; and now also economically because it is building a common market of
over 40 million people. That is why the kind of regional integration it
implements is such an important ideological and trade battleground. It
is also why Europe and the United States make such a fuss about tiny
Nicaragua, ALBA's leading promoter in Central America. If the ALBA
solidarity-based trade and cooperation model can be made to work then
US and European multinational corporations can kiss goodbye to the
fabulous profits they have always made in the region to the detriment
of the region's peoples.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The dilemmas of US decline in Central
America reflect the Obama administration's wider regional policy
failure. The acid test of a change in US foreign policy in Latin
America is its commitment to peace in Colombia and in Mexico. But there
is no sign of such a commitment. Traditional US military policies in
the region prevail. US Vice President Joe Biden made clear at the
meeting in Costa Rica that the US was not offering any financial aid to
the region to help impoverished countries cope with the global economic
depression. Instead he offered a few more tens of millons of
worth-less-and-less US dollars to implement Plan Merida - an even
deeper militarization of&nbsp; Mexico's narcotics wars, now spilling
over into neighbouring Guatemala. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But governments in the
region are not waiting for orders from the US and Europe any more. It
looks as though the crucial arguments are now going to be between what
Raul Zibechi has called Brazilian sub-imperialism and the radical
dynamism of Hugo Chavez backed by the wisdom and experience of his ALBA
colleagues in Cuba. In Central America, the arguments boil down to one
between the ALBA protagonists led by the FSLN government in Nicaragua,
Brazil's new Central American champion Mauricio Funes in El Salvador
and defenders of the failed model of US style free market capitalism,
principally Oscar Arias in Costa Rica. In the background, snug in their
military bases throughout the region, the US military stroke their
ironware.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
