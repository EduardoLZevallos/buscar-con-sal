at the Closing Ceremony of the Visit of the President of Iran, Compañero Ebrahim Raisi<br />
<br />
June 14th 2023</b></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Remarks by Daniel</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">In the meetings that you held this morning, institutional representatives addressed the issues that we had on the agenda that we discussed yesterday, and I want to emphasize that we recognize the willingness on your part, on the part of the People of Iran, to strengthen relations with Nicaragua. All the issues we discussed last night were items on the agenda of the bilateral meetings today, and as a result we encountered your willingness, Iran's willingness, to make progress on all these issues, to make progress on all these points.<br />
<br />
This has allowed agreement on three basic memorandums: The first Memorandum of Understanding, which is the Basic Memorandum of these steps which we will continue developing, is one that has to do with the creation of the Intergovernmental Joint Commission for economic, commercial cooperation and scientific-technical exchange between the Governments of the Republic of Nicaragua and the Islamic Republic of Iran.<br />
<br />
A second Memorandum that has already been agreed, has already been signed, is one that has to do with the matter of the Judicial Powers, that is, of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran and of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
And a third Memorandum has to do with medicines, equipment and medical supplies for laboratories and pharmaceuticals, between the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
Here we are talking about an agenda that involves the creation of the Joint Commission between Iran and Nicaragua, with a route that is the rapprochement of our Peoples, of our Institutions, for the benefit of development in the economic field, in the commercial field, in scientific-technical exchange and so on. That is, they are very sensitive issues for Families, for the People, for Workers, for Development.<br />
<br />
A formal note was also worked out to exchange information and to mark out a path that will allow us to establish relations between Iran and Nicaragua within the framework of a Free Trade Agreement.<br />
<br />
Well, here we are talking now about a result of this visit of yours, which of course encourages and strengthens relations between our Peoples and Governments.<br />
<br />
Another issue that we discussed last night, with you and your Ministers, one that has also been discussed today, and these are issues that will have to be further developed, such that we have a visit pending to Iran by our representatives on those issues, to give continuity, creating the conditions allowing agreements to be executed.<br />
<br />
We are and remain totally clear, on these points, that there is every willingness on Iran's part that we make our way in favor of the issues that are raised, but we have to create the conditions enabling these agreements to be executed. And this is why it the expectation of a delegation from Nicaragua to address these issues there in Iran was raised in the committees.<br />
<br />
So we should be ready to send the delegation as soon as we have firm dates, agreed upon dates, so there will be greater impetus for the implementation of these Agreements.<br />
<br />
As I told you yesterday, we recognize your visit as one reaching out to those countries, those Peoples most committed to the struggle in defense of the Sovereignty and Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean.<br />
<br />
Your visit to Venezuela clearly marks a path. That is to say, President Chávez, a Revolutionary, committed to Solidarity, a Fighter, who gave a great impulse to unity and cooperation between our Peoples; a struggle confronted always by imperialist aggression, the conspiracies of Imperialism, their coups d'etat, such as the one they mounted against Chávez, and the People rescued him after that coup d'etat. And then the attempted assassination of President Nicolás Maduro.<br />
<br />
Then the intensification of sanctions against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the theft that the North American rulers and European governments have committed against the Venezuelan people, stealing patrimony belonging to the Venezuelan State. And as you mentioned, the blockade, a brutal, total blockade, against Venezuela, not even allowing it to extract its own wealth, where your courageous Solidarity, that of the People of Iran, has accompanied the struggle for the legitimate rights of the Venezuelan people.<br />
<br />
Now you will head to Cuba, a Heroic People, a Heroic Revolution, now under blockade for more than 60 years, but still resisting Imperialism.<br />
<br />
That is to say, on this occasion you have come to show your Solidarity with heroic, combative, courageous Peoples, such as the Venezuelan People, the People of Bolívar; the Cuban People, the People of Martí, the People of Fidel, the People of Raúl, now with President Díaz-Canel at the helm; and the Nicaraguan People, where the People is President.<br />
<br />
So, thank you, beloved Brother President, thank you to your heroic, courageous People, thank you to your Heroes, to your Martyrs, today once again strengthening friendship and relations between Revolutionary Peoples: Iran, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
Carry our greetings, our affection, our respect to the Ayatollah, also to the People of Iran, to Iran's families, and to his family in particular. Thank you very much.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Remarks by President Ebrahim Raisi</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">In the Name of Allah, may Allah's Peace be upon His Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon Him and his Family.<br />
<br />
I am very glad to be here today in Latin America and in the sister country of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
I am grateful for the invitation of His Excellency President Daniel Ortega, and I am also grateful for this invitation, and my greetings and respects to the Heroic and loving People of Nicaragua. And I pay tribute and respect to the National Heroes of Latin America, especially of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
In the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the relationship with independent countries has always been central, and my visit here to Latin America, to the independent countries of the region, has been along the same lines.<br />
<br />
The will of the People, of the Peoples of the World is always respected by us, and we believe that if the will of the People predominates in the World, is taken into consideration in the World, and Imperialism sets aside its autocracy, its efforts to rule, and allows the will of the People to predominate in the World; then living conditions for the whole Planet would be very different than they currently are.<br />
<br />
But, unfortunately, today a system rules the World, an unjust Order, Imperialism, because it has forgotten God and forgotten the Identity of the Peoples, it oppresses other Peoples and hinders the fulfillment of the will of the Peoples.<br />
<br />
All the injustices that can be observed in the world today are due to having ignored the Will of God and the Principles of Justice and of the Consciousness of Peoples in the current World Order. Military interventions threats and coercive measures are the means they use to put nations under pressure.<br />
<br />
But the resistance of Peoples and the striving for Independence and Freedom neutralizes them and makes them retreat and fall back. That is the reality that has come about today here in Latin America and in many countries of this region, through the resistance of Peoples, imperialist interventions and the illegitimate demands of the United States have been rejected.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, the New World Order will be established favoring countries that resist and countries that are independent. The relationship between independent countries and leveraging their joint capabilities is extremely important.<br />
<br />
Unity and Integration between the countries of Latin America and other regions of the World would help, not only to consolidate integration but also to neutralize coercive measures.<br />
<br />
Our compañer@s and your compañer@s, President Ortega, have had conversations and have reached agreements defining the kinds of exchanges of capacity we need to have in order to raise the level of exchange and cooperation between both countries.<br />
<br />
The most important agreements are in the field of trade and economic exchange and cooperation. Agreements have also been reached to exchange experiences in the field of science and technology.<br />
<br />
The Islamic Republic of Iran despite all the coercive measures and threats, has achieved great advances in technological and scientific matters, therefore, today Iran can be called an advanced technological country.<br />
<br />
We are ready to share our experiences with friendly and fraternal countries. Therefore, among the important areas of cooperation between Iran and Nicaragua are the areas of science and technology.<br />
<br />
One of the areas of cooperation that we have defined with friendly countries, also with our neighbors and countries in the region, is the export of technical and engineering services. Our experienced and skilled experts are able to help solve issues that require technical expertise in friendly countries, and this is also one of the areas in which we can work with Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
The area of health and medical services is one of the important areas in which we have also made agreements to cooperate. We have made gigantic strides in the Islamic Republic of Iran in the field of health care, we have had excellent experiences in this field; we have well-trained and expert personnel in this field, especially in the pharmaceutical field, and we believe that this can also be one of the areas in which we can have very good cooperation and exchanges.<br />
<br />
We would like to thank President Daniel Ortega, the Vice President, all the authorities and the Nicaraguan delegation for their kindness, warm hospitality and welcome. And I take this opportunity to invite you to visit Tehran, Iran, so that you can get to know our country up close and make visits to our most important centers and places, especially sites related to science and technology.<br />
<br />
To President Ortega and the resilient people of Nicaragua, I wish you health and much success. And I pray to Almighty God, for the best successes and achievements for the Nicaragua’s resilient and noble People. Thank you very much.</span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Remarks by  Daniel</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">God wants us to visit Iran again. You know that we had the privilege of being in Iran in 2007, we had the opportunity to pay tribute to Ayatollah Khomeini, founder of the Republic of Iran, at the Mausoleum. Then, our meetings with the population, with the Iranian authorities, were really meetings of Friendship, meetings of Fraternal Peoples, and we are sure that this will not be your last visit to Nicaragua, and we will soon be there in Iran. Well, you're going to the airport, I imagine.</span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Remarks by President Ebrahim Raisi</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Since I have been informed that the Most Excellent President of the Brotherly Country, Cuba, is waiting for us there, then I have to say goodbye to you and leave for Cuba soon. Thank you very much.</span><br />
