Coverage of ALBA in Nicaragua's
corporate media: when intellectual integrity no longer fits the bill<br>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The opposition
media in Nicaragua claim President Daniel Ortega's
government manages the multimillion dollar Venezuelan cooperation in a
dishonest and fraudulent fashion. According to these media outlets the
government is probably creating a secret public debt of massive
proportions as a result of the commercial agreement between Venezuelan
and Nicaraguan state oil companies PDVSA and Petronic. Headlines
warning that the main purpose of the commercial agreement is to benefit
President Ortega's and his cronies' bank balances are commonplace.
Suggestions that the officials responsible for administering the
programs financed by Venezuela are corrupt fraudsters form part of many
mainstream journalists' daily reporting. Some have gone as far as to
suggest that the result of the government's "mishandling" of what they
disparagingly refer to as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez'
"Petrodollars" will be comparable to the devastating aftermath of the
CENIs scandal. (The CENIs scandal, considered the largest fraud in
Nicaraguan history, involved a number of high level public officials of
Arnoldo Aleman's and Enrique Bolaños' governments working together to
bankrupt the country to their personal financial benefit). <br>
<br>
According to Nicaraguan government officials, however, the country's
incorporation into the regional integration project ALBA (the
Bolivarian Alternative for the People of Our America) and the
subsequent funding made available for social, infrastructure, energy,
transport and agriculture programs, has saved the country from all out
economic and social collapse. Government officials and allies have
described the coverage of ALBA by Nicaragua's corporate friendly press
as media terrorism. President of Petronic Francisco Lopez had this to
say on the matter: <span style="font-style: italic;">"[The
opposition forces] sabotage every day via the
media using media terrorism to attack this noble project which offers
faith and hope to impoverished people. ... The line is to reject and
refuse to understand how countries can be in solidarity with us. Why do
they want and demand ratification by the National Assembly? So as to
have influence themselves over the management [of ALBA funds] when
their record is negative."</span> (1)<br>
<br>
During the First Latin American Encounter Against Media Terrorism which
took place in Venezuela earlier this year journalists and
communications experts from across the American continent got together
to discuss the "falsification" of information by corporate and
transnational media companies in the region. In the Encounter's final
declaration, <a href="http://www.alopresidente.gob.ve/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,0/task,doc_view/gid,355/">the
Caracas Declaration</a>,
this procedure was defined as "media terrorism" which was described as
"a form of constant massive aggression" aiming to undermine "people and
governments working for peace, justice and inclusion."<br>
<br>
So, do the claims by the Nicaraguan opposition media about the
government mismanaging ALBA funds stand up to close scrutiny of the
facts? To what extent can the anti ALBA media coverage be considered
the product of media editors' intellectual dishonesty as part of an
effort to destabilize the Sandinista [FSLN] government? Do the official
figures outlining the achievements of ALBA programs reflect the day to
day reality experienced by ordinary Nicaraguans in terms of access to
basic food products, electricity, public transport, employment and
financial credit? <br>
<br>
Among the media outlets I will refer to in this article as "opposition
media" are the two main daily newspapers, La Prensa and El Nuevo
Diario, a number of the most popular national TV channels including
Channel 2 and 12, numerous local and national radio stations like Radio
Corporation and Radio ABC Estereo, and internet news sources like
www.confidencial.com.ni, www.elinformativonica.com and
www.trinchera.com.ni. The editors and other influential journalistic
staff of these media outlets range from social democrat to the
reactionary right. Their stance on certain social issues such as the
polemic therapeutic abortion ban, for example, differs considerably.
They are united, however, by their apparent intent to undermine pretty
much everything the FSLN government has done over the last twenty
months.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Media pick and
choose news items to suit their take on events</span><br>
<br>
The criticism of the government's handling of ALBA funds most often
repeated is the presumed lack of transparency which, it is claimed
could lead to the creation of a secret public debt: "Colossal mess with
ALBA funds" (La Prensa, May 24th 2008), "Secret Public Debt,
ALBA-Caruna funds create parallel budget," (El Nuevo Diario, April 4th
2008), "A Dangerous Debt Looms: Venezuelan cooperation used
incorrectly" (La Prensa, June 20th 2008), "Ortega manages funds as he
chooses without responding to [calls for] transparency,"
(www.elinformativonica.com, April 28th 2008). These are just a few
examples of the sort of headlines that corporate friendly Nicaraguan
media outlets choose when reporting on ALBA. <br>
<br>
While the opposition media has proved itself very keen to emphasize
what its editors perceive as confusion, mix up and dishonesty, it has
not demonstrated the ability or the will to carry out the research
necessary to answer the questions raised or get to the bottom of the
doubts implied. Often media outlets will simply boycott or misreport
events in a way that fits in with their positions. To substantiate this
assertion it is worth taking a look at the way the opposition media
covered Petronic President Francisco Lopez' presentation to the
National Assembly's Economic Committee last June. After the media had
imposed the idea that the PDVSA Petronic trade agreement was creating a
public debt with Venezuela, a number of opposition deputies insisted
that Lopez clarify the terms of the agreement between Petronic and
PDVSA before the Economic Committee, which he did on June 11th. <br>
<br>
It is likely that Lopez' explanation to the Economic Committee was
similar to the one he gave to Tortilla con Sal during <a href="nicapetrocaribe.html">an interview&nbsp;in July</a>.
On that
occasion he described the agreement between PETRONIC and PDVSA as <span style="font-style: italic;">"a
sale and supply contract. It is not a contract between governments. It
is a contract between two companies. It is a simple business contract
falling under the commercial law of Venezuela and the commercial
regulations of Nicaragua. There is no debt of any kind. The contract
itself implies no obligation of legal commitments. No guarantee is
required of the Ministry of Finances or any other body of the
revolutionary government of Unity and Reconciliation. It is a bilateral
exchange between two businesses under whose terms and conditions the
whole debt has to be paid within 90 days. ... the means of payment that
Petronic or Albanisa now has with Venezuela is that 50% is paid within
90 days, 25% is paid to a legal entity defined by Venezuela, in this
case the ALBA fund and 25% is paid to a Nicaraguan financial entity
called Caruna, those are the choices the owner of the money, PDVSA, has
decided on and that is how the matter is treated in the contract."</span>
During the same interview Lopez said <span style="font-style: italic;">"the business project has been
explained to [the Economic Committee] exhaustively with documentation."</span><br>
<br>
After Lopez' presentation President of the Committee opposition deputy
Francisco Aguirre said he felt satisfied with Lopez' clarification that
no public debt was being created as a result of the importation of
Venezuelan oil under preferential payment conditions. El Nuevo Diario,
however, claimed, on June 12th, that Lopez had actually confused things
further. "Lopez did not clarify and then ran away [from journalists]"
read the headline. "Now no one knows what juridical status Petronic
has, what role ALBA-Caruna plays in public programs, or where private,
party and state interests begin and end," read the subtitle. "[The
situation represents] an enormous churned up river, where the only
thing clear is that there are abundant fishing opportunities." This
scathing, sarcastic discourse reads like opinion but is presented as
reporting. <br>
<br>
La Prensa, meanwhile chose to barely mention Lopez' presentation about
the PDVSA-Petronic trade agreement but ran a front page story under the
headline "Kicks instead of explanations" about what the La Prensa
described as Lopez and his teams' "aggression" towards journalists when
they questioned him about the "Tecnosa" case (La Prensa, June 12th).
The "Tecnosa" story is the case of a contract given to a construction
company Tecnosa, in which Lopez and members of his family have shares,
to build a number of houses as part of a government housing project,
"Houses for the People," which is funded in part by ALBA funds. The
opposition media claim the contract was awarded to Tecnosa as part of a
closed bidding process and is one of the mechanisms through which Lopez
is personally benefitting from ALBA funded programs. In response to
these media claims Lopez requested that the Comptroller General's
Office look into the case. The investigation is currently taking place.
Like on the occasion mentioned above, the "Tecnosa" story often serves
the opposition media as a convenient distraction to keep readers
attention from the real news story. Little if any information is
provided about the Comptroller investigation process, however. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ALBA Caruna also
discredited by media </span><br>
<br>
Since taking on the administration of funds made available from the
PDVSA Petronic trade agreement Caruna, a private financial cooperative,
has also received its fair share of demonization and misrepresentation
in the Nicaraguan media: "ALBA Caruna, a nice little earner," La
Prensa, June 20th, and "Dance of millions in ALBA Caruna," El Nuevo
Diario, June 16th 2008. Weekly center right news bulletin Confidencial
claimed in its edition for June 22th - 28th
that "the architects of 'operation ALBA' ... decided to channel funds
through ALBA Caruna" in order to avoid "parliamentary control and
audits. The antiquated micro credit institution [now administers the
ALBA funds] ... allowing President Daniel Ortega to do whatever he
pleases with the financial resources."<br>
<br>
During <a href="ingles_albacaruna.html">an interview with
Tortilla con Sal</a>&nbsp;in July Caruna's President Jorge
Martinez
spoke about the agreement it has with PDVSA and the ALBA country
signatories to manage the ALBA funds in Nicaragua. "On the agreement to
hold and manage money from the ALBA fund, basically what we have is an
agreement to hold and administer those funds so as to place them
correctly with fair, accessible interest rates that differentiate them
from the conventional banking system and other financial outfits in the
country." <br>
<br>
Here is a summarized overview of Caruna's work within the ALBA
framework taken from the same interview: <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">"We have an
agreement with PDVSA to hold and administer funds. An
agreement that frees up 25% of the oil invoice traded via an oil
distribution company in Nicaragua. We use that 25% to channel credit to
the farming and production sectors in our country and of that, up until
May this year we had placed C$440 million córdobas, a bit more than
US$22 million dollars to be more exact. And we have benefited about
50,000 people in 57 cooperatives of producers, cattle farmers and small
farmers throughout the country. Those C$440 million, those US$22
million, have been placed at an interest rate of 8% on the balance,
with different payment dates and periods depending on the activity
financed. Caruna reaches from Bilwi, or Puerto Cabezas, to Somotillo on
the Honduran border with 25 branches throughout the country. As well as
that we use the country's network of cooperatives to make loans with
Caruna so that credit reaches small farmers. We have alliances in
Chontales through the Caja Rural de Chontales, in Nueva Guinea with the
Banco de San Antonio, a cooperative, and we are working also with the
Fundación El Rama. These are the remotest parts of the country. And we
are about to open an agency in Bluefields in the Southern Autonomous
Region where we used not to have any branches.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">That is what the
funds are used for, from 25% of the oil receipts. The
other 25% freed up goes to the common fund of the ALBA member
countries, Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Those countries
decide how those resources are invested and we have an agreement with
them to administer those funds. So it is ALBA-Caruna that manages that
ALBA fund.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Both funds
originate from the oil receipts but the agreements are with
PDVSA, or PDVSA-Caruna to hold and administer those funds correctly. Of
those funds that have been used, US$20 million has been assigned to the
Streets for the people programme, that's about C$400 million. And for
improvements to public transport initially US$2 million have been
assigned but that will reach US$5 million. That is to say a little more
than C$100 million to modernize transport. And we are also supporting
the construction project Houses for the People, with a first stage of
400 houses for a sum reckoned at US$5 million. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">We have a
programme of artisanal fishing for the Northern and Southern
Autonomous Regions that benefits 830 artisanal fishing workers. We have
a programme of cattle rearing worth US$6 million scheduled to rear
24,000 calves and benefit 1675 producers. We have a programme of
agricultural inputs benefiting 8000 farmers via the distribution of
urea at a fair price, Urea for the People. And in coordination with the
Agriculture Ministry, MAGFOR, we have a programme to distribute seed
and inputs to a total of 87,000 families in that small farmer programme.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">We have a total of
about 170,000 Nicaraguans benefiting directly from
those funds, the ALBA fund and the ALBA-Caruna fund. Between the two we
have 170,000 Nicaraguans benefiting. So that is the coverage." </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
As Francisco Lopez explained, the owners of the money - PDVSA and the
governments of the ALBA countries - have chosen Caruna to administer,
under relatively strict supervision, the funds made available as a
result of a concessional commercial agreement between two companies.
All of these transactions take place outside the mechanisms of central
government, not by default but by design as part of ALBA's aim to
provide an alternative model based on fair trade, solidarity and
complementarity.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fears of a new
internal debt disproved by ALBA management</span><br>
<br>
After Lopez' presentation to the Economic Committee the media desisted
from its scaremongering about a debt with the Venezuelan authorities
and began suggesting that a massive internal debt with Caruna was being
created. "We owe millions of dollars to the government's para state
bank," read the front page headline of El Nuevo Diario on June 18th.
"The state has acquired a new internal debt for US$29.9 million with an
institution called ALBA-Caruna," read the subtitle. The day before the
same newspaper had put forward some questions about ALBA Caruna's
participation within the framework of ALBA. Below I have intertwined El
Nuevo Diario's questions with extracts from Tortilla con Sal's
interview with Jorge Martinez (JM) providing answers to the questions
raised. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">El Nuevo Diario,
June 17th:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">"This
is where a number of questions to do
with the oil agreement emerge ... who will Venezuela charge?
ALBA-Caruna or the State of Nicaragua?"</span> <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">JM, Tortilla con
Sal, July 25th:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">"In
the end, in the period available
to pay the credit since the funds are freed in cash by agreement with
the oil distributor to Caruna's account as stipulated by PDVSA, we are
the ones who are going to pay PDVSA. It is not a debt of the Nicaraguan
State, nor of any institution of the Nicaraguan State."</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">El Nuevo Diario:</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">"ALBA-Caruna lends
money to state owned generating
plants (US$29 million to Gecsa in 2007), to Central Government with the
"Streets for the People" program, and other loans; ... is a new
internal debt being generated as a result of these operations?"</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">JM:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Not at all. ... We could say
that people are trying in bad faith
to sell the idea that the resources freed up from the oil invoice and
that we have made available to the generating and transmission system
is a public debt. But really it is not a public debt because in
parallel we have a contract with Union Fenosa where they recognize that
all the resources handed over to the petrol companies or to the
generators is on behalf of Union Fenosa.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Union Fenosa
receives a subsidy from the Nicaraguan state derived from
the fact that all Nicaraguans consuming less than 150 kilowatt hours a
month get a subsidy. That subsidy is paid out by the Treasury Ministry
to Union Fenosa. So then Union Fenosa has an agreement signed with
Caruna saying that they pass that to Caruna so as to pay what was spent
on generating and transmitting by Caruna. The debt relationship is that
Union Fenosa owes Caruna, because Union Fenosa receives the benefit of
services from ENATREL and ENEL and from its system of generation and
transmission because they distribute that energy and charge for it. So
then, the one responding for that debt is Union Fenosa and those
critics know it and have kept quiet about it."</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
As for the assertion that ALBA-Caruna is lending money to Central
Government as part of the Streets for the People program, Martinez
explained that this program is actually carried out on a municipal
level with loans being made through the Association of Nicaraguan
Municipalities (AMUNIC).<br>
<br>
Unless one believes that Martinez was making up all the information he
presented in his interview (as opposition media editors perhaps would),
it is fair to say that a considerable amount is being achieved with the
funds made available from the PDVSA Petronic/Albanisa concessional
trade
agreement. Supporters of the government claim the opposition forces in
Nicaragua have chosen to misunderstand and misinform the general public
about this process. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Officials working
within ALBA framework loth to answer hostile
journalist's questions</span><br>
<br>
It is true that there are numerous details about the mechanisms through
which ALBA projects operate that have not been made clear by the
government and the other institutions involved. Perhaps this is in part
due to the true novelty of the program being put in place (never before
has a process of Latin American integration and solidarity been so far
reaching and effective). The FSLN government and its allies are
involved in implementing a process without precedents. At times perhaps
actions are improvised and exact future measures and consequences
unknown. Add to this situation the prospect of hostile journalists
asking what may be considered as irrelevant questions and it is
understandable if public officials and other important figures are keen
to avoid talking to the press. Jorge Martinez (JM) and Caruna's
Assistant Manager Armando Chible (AC) gave the following account of
their experience with the national media:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">JM : Within the
framework of our public relations and media relations
we have developed information for national media on what we do, for
example, when we open a new branch or when we hand over a new loan. The
information is public.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">But some media,
like El Nuevo Diario or La Prensa, have come asking for
information and ask questions in bad faith. We had an event in the
PAEBANIC centre to talk about the agricultural cycle with 63
cooperatives and 100 leaders. We were talking about interest rates,
loans, the sectors we support. And one of those journalists came up to
me and said &#8220;Caruna manages the ALBA money......don't you think that
money comes from shady sources?&#8221; So when someone starts to talk like
that, I have to say, &#8220;Look, excuse me I cannot discuss the matter with
you because you are presupposing things that don't exist or exist only
in your imagination....&#8221;</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">AC : In that event
we were explaining the different programmes we had
with Wisconsin, ALBA-Caruna and so on.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">JM : We were
presenting via Datashow.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">AC : So they are
watching, all those news media but... they are not
seeing. We put everything on the screen. But the journalists don't see,
What they see is the dark side. They see the words ALBA-Caruna and are
prejudiced. So there's good reason not to help that along when the
journalist concerned is in bad faith and only wants to find something
bad. They just have to see that it's Chavez, that it's ALBA, that it's
ALBA-Caruna and there, it's bad.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition media
instigate unrealistic expectations</span><br>
<br>
Another way in which the opposition media undermine the achievements of
ALBA is by instigating unrealistic expectations among the general
public. For example, during the national public transport strike in
May, many opposition media outlets criticized the government for not
freezing the oil price, as if that was within the realms of possibility
for the government of one of the most impoverished countries in the
continent. President Ortega's comment, "we must take consciousness of
the moment we are living," during an address to the nation at the
height of the strike was astute and relevant, while the opposition
media refused to take on board the profundity of the international
crisis caused by constant oil price increases. On May 17th the strike
came to an end after the ALBA country Presidents agreed to provide
funding for a US$1.30 discount per gallon of fuel for all public
transport in Nicaragua. <br>
<br>
In a similar vein, opposition media criticisms that the FSLN government
is not doing enough to combat inflation are often made without
reference to the international context. For example, on June 6th
internet news site Trinchera published a story under the
headline "[Venezuelan] oil does not contain crisis," in which it was
reported that "despite [Chavez'] promise that the [PDVSA Petronic]
agreement would solve the country's oil problems, the problem has
actually got worse, ... the price of gasoline continues to rise." The
article was taken from the Christian Science Monitor, a US publication,
and translated into Spanish for a Nicaraguan audience. As in other ALBA
member countries the opposition media enjoys taking advantage of the
international financial and economic crises to portray progressive
governments as incompetent. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ALBA social policy
unacceptable for Latin American elites </span><br>
<br>
Soon after Nicaragua's incorporation into ALBA in April 2007 President
Ortega described the regional integrationist project in the following
way: "Today ALBA represents the only alternative which offers [our]
peoples the chance to progress, with the conception of fair trade, with
solidarity as a fundamental element, with the asymmetries or
differences in our economies taken into account, so that we really can
achieve growth, which, with the passage of time, permits balanced
relationships allowing us to move forward together with economies that
can respond to [the demands] of our societies."<br>
<br>
These confident words have effectively been proved to be true during
the last 18 months. Contrary to what the corporate Nicaragua media
would have us believe, ALBA has provided incomparable financial support
during the crises and tragedies Nicaragua has faced. It was because of
ALBA that the Nicaraguan government was able to overcome the daily
power cuts of up to twelve hours in 2007. After Hurricane Felix a
category 5 storm caused devastation in Nicaragua's north Caribbean
coast in September 2007 the Venezuelan government was the first and has
been the most generous donor. After a fire destroyed the livelihoods of
over 1,500 small business men and women in Managua'a largest market, el
Mercado Oriental, in July this year BANDES, the Venezuelan National
Development Bank, provided US$3.5 million in low interest rate loans to
those affected. <br>
<br>
Francisco Lopez is of the opinion that "[ALBA's] framework has social
policy areas that are inconceivable for the Right, inconceivable for
the people who sabotage this project. ... Why do [our adversaries] feel
threatened? Because their methods, their policies, their neoliberal
thinking has failed." <br>
<br>
After considering the information available and the claims made by both
the opposition media and the FSLN government and its allies, who you
end up believing really comes down to who you think is more credible
based on whatever first, second or third hand experience you have had
in or to do with Nicaragua. For what it is worth here is a bit about my
experience. I have lived in an impoverished rural community in the
north of Nicaragua for the last five years with my husband [a campesino
farmer] and our daughter. Over the last eighteen months I have
witnessed results of the ALBA funded projects which the opposition
media claim do not exist, disregard, or say do not have any beneficial
effect. <br>
<br>
It is true that the daily power cuts which affected the country
during 2006 - 7 have been overcome almost completely. It is true that
ALBA-Caruna and the Ministry of Agriculture are making accessible
credit widely available for campesino farmers to grow basic food
products (over half the farmers in my community were able to plant
crops that way this year). I know three women who have been benefitted
with the Zero Hunger Food Production bonus. The same program will be
benefitting five families in the community where I live next year.
<br>
<br>
Friends of mine in two different barrios in Managua and in three
different barrios in Esteli have confirmed to me that they are able to
purchase the below market priced basic foods as a result of the Food
for the People program. I recently saw repair work on a road in a
marginalized barrio&nbsp; as part of the Streets for the People
Program in the municipality of Sebaco where the local government is
controlled by the PLC. The bus fare on public transport in Managua was
still C$2.50 when I was there last week. <br>
