with Semyon Senderov, Interview Program, RT in Spanish<br />
<br />
June 23rd 2025</strong></h3>

<p><br />
<b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Hello, how are you all? Welcome to a new edition of INTERVIEW. Today we have an opportunity to talk with the President of the Central Bank of Nicaragua, Ovidio Reyes. Ovidio, thank you so much for being with us, for finding the time for us.</p>

<p>First of all I want to ask you about the economic situation of Nicaragua, because as you will know better than anyone, there are new data; in fact, the Gross Domestic Product is growing, it marked a growth of 3%.</p>

<p>How do you assess this situation? Does it have only internal effects, or does it also influence, for example, the situation in general, between neighboring countries?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Yes, the Nicaraguan economy has been growing steadily in the last 3 years, we believe that the potential growth is around 4%, between 3 and 4%. In other words, that’s where we are.</p>

<p>But it is not only economic growth, that is to say, we have declining inflation, the last inflation report is barely 1% year-on-year; that is a very low inflation rate. Likewise, the unemployment rate stood at 3%, which is a rate with which the economy can be said to be stable, and that it is at its potential level.</p>

<p>A set of policies has been implemented to achieve this result, the main one, I would say, has to do with the policy of promoting foreign trade via our exports, and the insertion of our country in different international markets.</p>

<p>In fact, we have a good performance of the export sector, which this year has had important growth rates, that are around 8%, growing our exports, and especially a country like ours that produces raw materials for the international market and this has had a positive consequence for our country.</p>

<p>On top of that, public finances are very healthy, unlike other countries that unfortunately have fiscal deficits. Nicaragua has had a fiscal surplus in its budget accounts for the third year running, and this has allowed the public debt to be reduced, our public debt stands at about 54% of GDP.</p>

<p>Compared with other countries too, it is a low level of debt, and it is something that we call Fiscal Consolidation, contributing to this result with accumulation of International Reserves and reduction of international obligations, and that strengthens the current account surplus in the balance of payments.</p>

<p>In summary, we have a good macroeconomic context that the economy knows how to take advantage of, and our companies that have joined the international market, are able to generate enough resources, and continue maintaining that result that is positive.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>I think that, in this context, you mentioned very low inflation levels, many countries would be looking at it with envy. Because this is really an issue that worries many nations, especially now when I think it is very difficult to predict the economic future, if we take into account, for example, the decisions of Donald Trump, the US President who threatens other countries, who applies economic pressure.</p>

<p>Do you think this has a serious effect, in general, and how could countries cope with it? How could they avoid that economic worsening, because of his policies?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Inflation in Nicaragua is a result of two factors, one is external and has to do with the evolution of international prices, with the pandemic international prices soared and inflation in Nicaragua as well.</p>

<p>We even came to have inflation of 11%, as a result of the generalized increases in the prices of the products that we import, which came to grow on average by 22% in our case.</p>

<p>That is, there is an international effect of course which affects us and has affected us; but then prices began to decline internationally. We also reinforced ourselves with a set of policies, like the ones I mentioned, and now we have 1% inflation.</p>

<p>At the international level there is talk that the effects of the tariffs implemented by the United States government have not yet been manifested. In fact, there is a waiting period, because everyone expects that, it bears repetition, there will be a few months, a few months that will elapse before they are reflected in the prices.</p>

<p>While this is happening, we are working on internal consolidation. Of course, measures such as tariffs do have an impact and a repercussion of scale, especially in the case of such a large economy, like that of the United States, and of course that is also a concern.</p>

<p>But, in our case, what we did was to promote actions so that the productive sectors did get complacent and sought productivity improvements and production increases so as to compensate for this action, which may have long-term consequences, as economists are pointing out that it might have on prices.</p>

<p>The only way, that at least we see, since we are a small economy and we are not on the scale of industrial nations, is to seek productivity improvements and competitiveness improvements internally to be able to compensate for those tariffs.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the most affected countries are going to feel a negative effect on their production, on their jobs; but well, experience shows that, faced with these shocks, in the end the economy goes through a cycle, and that alternatives will have to be found, and that's the other part, that I think all nations, all of them, including us, are looking for other markets, because faced with actions of that nature, the only thing that remains for one to do is to look for new markets.</p>

<p>In fact, our participation in the St. Petersburg Economic Forum is carrying out that action, of looking for alternative markets, because in the face of unchanging policies in the US, we have to look for countries with more stable policies.</p>

<p>I even believe that this will lead to the formation of new trade agreements and alliances worldwide, so as to have predictability, which is what all entrepreneurs, investors and traders are looking for, to have predictable policies.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>You have just made a quite serious warning to other countries, that they should prepare for the consequences that are still to come, is that right?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Indeed, I think all countries are doing it, perhaps some more than others, especially those that are going to have a greater impact on their tariffs than the countries in which the tariff was 10%. But regardless of that, we have to look for new alliances and new agreements.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Do you think that the other Latin American countries could copy your model of solving this problem, for example, by focusing on issues such as foreign investment?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>I think so, in fact, all countries have opted for foreign investment, because it is a component that helps to cushion the effects of internal slowdowns as well.</p>

<p>We, for example, had a decrease in investment, and yet with all the recent economic results we now have an acceleration of foreign investment in Nicaragua. We went from having a low that brought us foreign investment of just 7% of GDP, now to a foreign investment equivalent to 14% of GDP.</p>

<p>In other words, this helps us to have fresh resources, but above all to continue accumulating capital, which is what is needed to be able to export and produce more.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>But it's not just about the conditions now, about Donald Trump's decisions, for example. The case of Nicaragua is that its institutions suffer strong sanctions by the United States and the European Union. What are Nicaragua's strategies to deal with them, and maybe it could work for other nations as well?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>You see, the strategy is to have flexibility; that is, one cannot impose rigidities in the face of sanctions; that is to say, one must let the economy flow, let the markets flow, let payment systems develop, and let citizens find alternatives and solutions.</p>

<p>In fact, it is not a good action to move to control the markets; it is quite the opposite, in a framework of more flexibility, that allows those trade channels that were closed to find new routes, especially those that are in the private sector, because the decentralized economy today works very well.<br />
<br />
So, what can be done from the Government point of view is the promotion of trade agreements and treaties, so that then the economy can seek its channels.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>What is the relationship of the Central Bank of Nicaragua with international organizations, for example, such as the International Monetary Fund?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Well, Nicaragua signed the IMF Agreement and is part of the Organization in terms of the share capital it owns in that Institution. Therefore, we have the responsibility and the right also acquired by being a member of the Fund, to request access to its financing, but also to have communication with them.</p>

<p>We have a fluid communication with the International Monetary Fund in economic matters so that their respective evaluations are carried out. In fact, the last Assessment they made of the country's economy was positive, and the exchange of information is part of that relationship.</p>

<p>Of course, the IMF as an institution has an important role at the global level as a stabilizer; there ar situations in which sometimes that function is not fully fulfilled. But, yes, theirs is an important opinion which at least in the case of Nicaragua is quite representative and is listened to by investors; so, we try to maintain the reputation that we have had and that we have achieved based on our own effort.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>It is important that you now differentiate between one case and another, so to speak, because the IMF in particular has been quite criticized, for example, sometimes for its politicization which is one opinion; sometimes for practically choking other nations with its aid, but also with the impositions of its financial policies. In your opinion, is it possible for this type of body to completely abstain from politics?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>It's a bit complicated to think that an International Institution is going to be totally isolated from everything else, isn't it? It is difficult, but it is the ideal, because in the Constitutive Agreement of that body, it signed economic agreements, not political agreements.</p>

<p>In fact, the design of the world was like this, it is the United Nations that is the political body while the IMF and the World Bank are financial arms that should support all countries equally.</p>

<p>This is something that we have discussed frankly with the International Monetary Fund, and we have asked them, and requested that the dialogue be of an economic order, of an economic nature.</p>

<p>Because in the economic order we understand each other very well; that is, they ask, for example, for economic stability; well, we agree to ensure economic stability; financial stability, banking stability, and in fact, we actively deliver that banking and financial stability.</p>

<p>Even, the well-founded slogan in the IMF of fiscal consolidation is fiscal surplus; then, we say, perfect, we are going to ensure that and we agree that a country needs fiscal consolidation and fiscal surplus. We agree on that kind of thing. But if we are then going to political matters, I think they do not have the expertise to talk about these issues.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>I understand that the Central Bank also plays a very important role in helping the development of rural areas, areas that are difficult to access. What are the strategies that your institution is taking precisely?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Well, the Central Bank has been promoting payment systems, via financial technologies, in retail payments; in fact, we have development plans that we have been discussing with the country’s financial system to be able to expand these services to new service users, to the largest possible number.</p>

<p>In fact, we have a virgin terrain, because in Nicaragua, the degree of financial depth is still low compared to other countries. That is to say, we have about 22% of the population with access to financial services and the rest do not have it. So, for us this is a strategic issue to be able to provide financial services, we have raised this very successfully with the country’s financial institutions and we are already developing solutions.</p>

<p>The banks are currently designing payment services, transfer services, and we are going to do our own work from the Central Bank, to be able to provide this access to the entire population, as far as possible.<br />
<br />
In addition, we have already had an 80% degree of depth of cellular telephony; if we look at it mathematically, 80% access to cellular telephony, 20% access to financial services, then we are talking about 60% of the population that could access financial services through cellular technology.</p>

<p>We are all making this effort and we would hope that, with that factor, and in addition to other indicators, for example, access to energy in Nicaragua is fantastic…</p>

<p>We have about 90% access to electricity, and that, combined with cellular telephony, is a promising field. I think that in the coming years we will see a financial deepening in Nicaragua in that sense.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>I imagine that now attention can also be diverted a little, because if we see, for example, the news of recent days, global conflicts, we talk for example about the conflict that broke out between Iran and Israel, this could really affect the economic world.</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Indeed, a conflict of this nature and scale can have consequences; however, countries need to continue to have communication and means of payment. Regardless of what may happen in the rest of the world, it does not prevent us, with our own effort and resources, and we we have to continue with that development.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>But the consequences could reach all the way to Latin America.</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Agreed, but in the long run also, internally as a country, as a nation, we need to continue developing financial services, anyway. In other words, it is something that we are not going to stop doing because of world conflicts.</p>

<p>I have already explained the numbers, we are talking about the possibility that 60% of the population has access to financial services through electronic means, we cannot give up on that, regardless of what happens.</p>

<p>The truth is that I am talking, in this sense, about the internal economy, not about the external economy; so, in that sense, we are going to continue working.</p>

<p>As for transactions and payments, of course, international payments are going to be more complicated in the face of such an event, because all these issues of sanctions and threats of unilateral actions, of course that leaves us and can generate a brake on activity.</p>

<p>But, we have seen that in the face of these difficulties we have to innovate, we have to think about alternative ways of doing things, and it has worked for us. From the different negative events that we have received as an economy, we have tried to look for the advantages, and draw on our strengths so as to be able to move forward.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Speaking of the threats, because you already mentioned some in your opinion, in general, what are the threats for Latin America?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b>  </p>

<p>At the moment I think the two most general ones have to do with trade issues, the unpredictability issues that there are now of unstable trade tariffs, that is an issue that worries everyone.</p>

<p>In fact, in the last meetings we have had with Central Bank Presidents, that is the topic that is being discussed. Even in our talks with the International Monetary Fund, that is the issue.</p>

<p>The trade issue is a very relevant issue, and the other one is the migration issue; in our case, Central America is a large recipient of family remittances, the flow of foreign currency from all citizens residing in the United States who receive money from their relatives, and it is also a concern that it can happen.<br />
<br />
In recent legislation that was proposed there in the United States, there is a 3.5% tax on all remittances. So these are two issues at least in the case of our Region, Central America, even Mexico. They are relevant issues that need to be addressed, they are the main risks for us.</p>

<p>The main risks that we see, in the case of our countries, come from the international context, rather than from the internal context. Because Latin America has made great progress in economic stabilization; there are countries that have their particularities, but after many years of instability, Latin America has a good context in terms of stability.</p>

<p>So, anything that disturbs things, for example, these conflicts, anything that disturbs international trade, is a matter of legitimate concern of our country.  </p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>You were able to be present at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, how do you assess the results of this event and whether it was possible to reach some kind of agreements, because we have already seen it in numerous meetings precisely with Latin American representatives.</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>I think that all these spaces are important for what we were talking about, to look for alternatives for our countries, and we see that there is also a lot of interest from national investors from Russia in this event, but also from the rest of the world, I understand that there are 140 countries participating here.</p>

<p>At least in our case we have carried out an important agenda, and agreements have been reached in different areas of work, especially in the Health Care, in Education, and we have been working to be able to have the kind of space that we are looking for.</p>

<p>I think it is also an opportunity, of course, for Russia to show its economic muscle, because it has a strong economy in the sense that it has managed to overcome all obstacles and is making progress.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>And it is the most sanctioned country in the world.</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>And for that same reason,we must learn from that experience, because really nations like ours, face all these threats, and it is important to know how they are managed, to know about their policy, to learn from the entrepreneurial spirit so as to be able to replicate these actions in countries like ours and to be able to continue reaping success in economic development.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>When talking about alternatives, special attention is always paid to the BRICS, and in fact there is a lot of talk in the Forum on this. How do you rate this instrument now?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>I think it is an excellent multilateral instrument, there is a political will on the part of the countries that make up the BRICS, to develop a new trade scheme. That is welcome, we see an opportunity there, because, in addition, there is mention of an alternative payment platform to the existing ones, and if we believe in the competitive world, the more offers there are of payment systems, and the more offers there are of commercial agreements, then there is more competition, so things should be better.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is an opportunity for many countries, in fact, there is a founding country from Latin America in the BRICS, such that Latin American countries can also participate in this Organization in order to have the benefits, not only of payment systems and trade, but also of the financing that could come from the New Development Bank that is promoting the BRICS.</p>

<p>So, it is a very solid initiative of emerging nations with large economies, with a lot of trade and big populations, in which I think Nicaragua is interested to be part of, because we have the conditions and requirements that are required to be able to participate in it.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>From the US they even sometimes make threats, these comments are thrown out that they do not want others to participate in the BRICS. Does that make you feel threatened?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>There are many factors, in economic terms, a high percentage of the economy, something we have learned is that competition is good, but for the meantime the US position does not affect us. And I would say sometimes there are reactions that are exaggerated.</p>

<p>Generally I think that competition is not to be feared; on the contrary, you have to accept it, one should not feel challenged because a rival appears since together with them, we can offer a service, and in any case the world is growing and there are constantly new clients.</p>

<p>So, one more member added to the group of bidders, is not going to hurt you, on the contrary, it is going to force you to compete better.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>So, would you say that a new world order is forming right now?</p>

<p><b>Ovidio Reyes</b></p>

<p>Of course it is forming, because when there are actions that try to holding back economic development, one has to look for new alliances, new methods, and new ways of doing things; it is inevitable that this will happen.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Thank you very much for your time and for this Interview. That's all everyone, thank you for your attention and until next time.</p>
