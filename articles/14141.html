<p><strong>Message from President-Comandante Daniel<br />
at the Ceremony in Commemoration of the 42nd Anniversary<br />
of the of the National Literacy Crusade<br />
<br />
March 23rd, 2022</strong><br />
<br />
Good afternoon, Young people, Divine Treasure. And at the head of  our Youth are the Children who have received their awards of recognition. And accompanying our Youth are our Teachers. Our Teachers. In Education, the Teacher cannot be absent.<br />
<br />
Here we have several outstanding teachers, and all those who choose the career of teaching, really, chose a noble vocation of service, like doctors, nurses; noble careers, service, like those of of all workers, but, unquestionably, knowledge is fundamental for all human beings, regardless of the job they choose, the career they choose, knowledge is fundamental.<br />
<br />
Today we are commemorating the 42nd Anniversary of the National Literacy Crusade...</p>

<p>42 years! And we are accompanied by a Comrade, a Brother, someone who has already won the Rubén Darío Order, this Maestro, but we are awarding him, on May 18th  the birthday of our General, we will be giving Maestro Orlando Pineda the Order of Sandino, as a Hero of Literacy!<br />
<br />
He goes to teach literacy out in the most remote areas, in the areas of the Río Coco and the Río San Juan.<br />
<br />
There among the communities of our native peoples, the Miskito, Mayagna and Ramakí communities, this Teacher is there, among the Afro-descendant communities, the Teacher is there too, and with him go the education programs that we continue to develop in these times as well, full of song,  of life and hope, even though we are facing great challenges.<br />
<br />
And the great challenge for Humanity has always been Peace and how the World can achieve Peace, and here in Nicaragua we have a Youth and we have a People that is committed to Peace, Education for Peace, Education for Justice, Education for Freedom, in combination.<br />
<br />
We have saluted a Cuban compañera, who is in a meeting, a gathering here with our comrades working in Education. And when we talk about the National Literacy Crusade here in our country, we immediately have to mention Cuba, because Cuba took the first step in Latin America and the Caribbean, and Nicaragua took the second step accompanied by Cuba.<br />
<br />
In other words, the experience that our Cuban Sisters and Brothers had acquired teaching literacy, they then transferred that experience to us, thanks to Fidel, who was always thinking and working for the Education of the People of Cuba and of the Peoples of Our America, and of the Peoples of the World.<br />
<br />
Fidel's work in this field was exceptionally noble and I had the honor of participating in the inauguration of the Medical School for the Youth of Latin America and the World. Hundreds of Nicaraguan young people have now been trained in that School of Medicine in Cuba, where tuition and education are free, imparted without payment! It is a noble gesture and among the noblest  gestures of solidarity of the Cuban people, among the Cuban people's many other gestures of nobility.<br />
<br />
We greet our brother Manssour Bin Mussalam, a young man who is the General Secretary of the Educational Cooperation Organization. He is from Saudi Arabia. We are thousands of kilometers away from Saudi Arabia, but we have him here with us  in Nicaragua doing work related to Education, and the timing of his visit coincides with this date of the 42nd Anniversary, precisely on the day on which we are holding this Celebration of our Youth, our Teachers and Children.<br />
<br />
I was asking one of the compañeros, one of the boys who have now achieved their baccalaureate, what he plans to study. He told me that he is already studying, and in fact he wants to follow a career of Engineering for Economics and Business. Here is the University Rector, Ramona. And well, he told me he has to find out how to satisfy the requirements.... But he is already classified, Rector! More than classified! Indeed, really he is more than classified!<br />
<br />
Likewise, those who have been awarded recognition as Best Students, who are in high school and who are now choosing a career, well, we will have to recognize that, because they are  classified now after being recognized as the Best Students nationally! So really they are super classified and so, congratulations boys, congratulations girls.<br />
<br />
Together with you we also bring our greetings, our love, our embrace, to your teachers. From the time you all began to read and write, to those who are now concluding their Primary School, those who are now concluding their Secondary School, all our teachers have been contributing to the growth of this Tree of Education. And to their Families, to their Mothers, to their Grandmothers, to their Fathers, to all the Families that have accompanied them and who today celebrate, and have been celebrating year after year, the fact that they have been making advances in Education.<br />
<br />
We congratulate too our People, all the Nicaraguan Families, because the work of Nicaragua's Families, the contribution of Nicaragua's Families is fundamental for us to have an Education for the People, an Education accessible to all our Youth, thanks to their work, to the effort of Nicaragua's Families, of Nicaragua's Workers, of those who are there, out in the Sun, working the land, of those who are there harvesting Beans and Corn, of those who work in the countryside, those who work in the cities, those workers who build our schools, the workers who build our hospitals and health centers.<br />
<br />
Because we know very well that Health is fundamental, and Education too. Health is fundamental for all the activities of the People, to ensure the work of Nicaragua's Families. And in the name of the People of Nicaragua we say to you, Children, Youth, Young People, our creative Teachers, we say to you, Congratulations! And thank you for honoring Nicaragua, for honoring Darío, for honoring Sandino, for honoring the people of Nicaragua. Thank you.</p>

<b>after the Ceremony in Commemoration</b><br />
<b>of the 42nd Anniversary of the National Literacy Crusade</b><br />
<br />
<b>March 23rd, 2022</b><br />
<br />
Good evening. It's a lovely Day, a lovely Afternoon and also wonderful Times we are living in, full of Faith, full of Love .... Patriotic Love, Honorable every day in the way we love our Nation promoting Peace, Dignity and Goodness, by means of our Study, our Commitment and our Labor !<br />
<br />
We see these Boys and Girls, these Children and their Parents, we see them and feel strengthened, full of Hope, knowing that, step by step, we are coming out of the Darkness in which they tried to leave us, and we have turned that Darkness into Clarity, and we continue to do so through Auroras, through Dawns, full of Sunlight, that Sun that illuminates us and never sets !<br />
<br />
We see these Boys and Girls, and we see the certainty of Hope in the Future we all building that together. And we congratulate each and every one of them, we want to congratulate the Communities that are so proud to have Better Students, Better Teachers in the neighborhoods we mentioned before, where they live.<br />
<br />
We would like to congratulate all the Families.... for all the Effort and the many Dreams that the Grandmothers, the Aunts, the Fathers and the Mothers endow to each one of these children. So many Dreams that now can be realized because there is a Program, a Project  Fighting against Poverty.... A very real fight! And that Program and that Project give us certainty for the Future.<br />
<br />
We have a Vocation for the Future, for Transcendence,  we have the Vocation and Character to overcome all challenges, setbacks and difficulties. And Education, which embodies all our Dreams coming true, is the key to moving forward so as to overcome the difficult conditions we inherited, and to make progress in creating the Future we all deserve.<br />
<br />
Work, Education, Security and Peace, that is Nicaragua.... Happiness !<br />
<br />
We feel blessed with our Young People. We feel blessed with all these Education Programs that we develop, day by day, with all our heart, determined to create, all of us together, a Better Nicaragua, that Just Nicaragua, that Prosperous Nicaragua, that Nicaragua of Well-being, that Nicaragua all of us want, and all of us deserve.<br />
<br />
Visitors, anyone coming here, anyone who arrives here, admire the Joy, the Tranquility that people exude in Nicaragua, and that Joy, that Tranquility is reinforced via a People, a Youth dedicated to Study, to our Culture, to the defense of our Culture, of our Cultural, National Identity. That Joy is lived out in the fruits of our Labor, thanks to the support that Workers in the Countryside or in the City, small businesse in urban areas, receive from so many Programs of our Christian, Socialist and Solidarity based Government!<br />
<br />
Content, proud, blessed and grateful to God, Let's Get Ahead... 42 Years of Light, of Victories !<br />
<br />
As I was telling Salvador, Comandante Daniel has requested that we mark this day, every year, with Awards to the Best Students of Primary and Secondary School, of Trainee Teachers from the Teacher Training Colleges training Teachers, at all levels.<br />
<br />
We are going to designate this day of the beginning of the National Literacy Crusade to make those Awards and recognize that Education, like Health, is the basis for the Future of our Country, above all, a Country that treasures, protects and cares for Peace based on National Dignity.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Compañeras and Compañeros... And let's go forward, all of us together, with the spiritual strength of a People that knows how to study, knows how to work, knows how to overcome.<br />
<br />
Onward, Compañer@s ! Thank you.</p>
