<p><strong>INTERVENTION OF MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br />
DENIS MONCADA COLINDRES<br />
<br />
New York, September 28, 2019</strong></p>

<p>    • Your Excellency<br />
António Guterres<br />
Secretary General of the United Nations</p>

<p>    • Your Excellency<br />
Tijjani Muhammad-Bande<br />
President of the 74th Session of<br />
the United Nations General Assembly</p>

<p><br />
    • Representatives of the United Nations<br />
Member States</p>

<p>    • Honorable Delegates</p>

<p>Receive the fraternal Message of Peace and Respect from the People of Nicaragua, the President of the Republic, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Vice-President, Compañera Rosario Murillo.</p>

<p>    1. The theme of this Session: “Galvanizing multilateral efforts for the eradication of poverty, quality education, climate action and inclusion,” coincides with prioritized State policies, which the Government of Nicaragua has successfully developed over the last decade.</p>

<p>We reaffirm the commitment and political Will of the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of Nicaragua to continue developing and strengthening these inclusive economic and social policies, aimed toward the Common Good of Nicaraguans.</p>

<p>    2. Nicaragua welcomes the efforts promoted by the Secretary General at the Climate Action Summit held here in New York, as well as the commitments assumed in this framework by many of the States, aimed at overcoming the grave threat to the existence of Humanity that is caused by climate change.</p>

<p>    3. Nicaragua and the countries of the Central American region are among the most vulnerable nations on the planet, and our people suffer very serious consequences due to the destructive effects of climate change. It is urgent that the International Community adopt measures that curb global warming to ensure the future of The Earth, humanity and the life of present and future generations.</p>

<p>    4. Based on the Principle of Common, but Differentiated Responsibilities, our country makes great economic, social and preventive efforts to address Climate Change, with positive results that have been internationally recognized.</p>

<p>    5. Nicaragua will continue being a factor of stability, peace and regional security, and will also continue to fight to maintain the important indicators of inclusive economic, political, educational and social development achieved so far, attaining significant progress toward the eradication of poverty.</p>

<p>    6. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recognizes that the Government of Nicaragua has achieved success in its economic and social policies.</p>

<p>In addition, UNICEF recognizes that Nicaragua has a broad legal framework, as well as national and international instruments that protect human rights of children and adolescents.</p>

<p>It also recognizes that the Government of Nicaragua has managed to reduce general poverty rates by 17.6% and extreme poverty by 7.7%, between 2009 and 2016, as well as having achieved a notable reduction in infant mortality.</p>

<p>UNICEF also recognizes that in Nicaragua, significant progress has been made to guarantee free access, extensive coverage and better quality Education.</p>

<p>UNICEF and Nicaragua have agreed upon a Cooperation program for 2019-2023.</p>

<p>    7. We reiterate that in order to comply with the 2030 Agenda and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including overcoming poverty and quality education, the existence of unilateral coercive measures, which violate international law and the Human Rights of our Peoples, must disappear. Establishing obstacles to prevent our people from reaching these goals is inhuman and criminal and must be denounced and condemned by all of Humanity.</p>

<p>    8. Once again we raise the urgent call for a reinvention of the UN, as proposed by Nicaraguan Priest and Foreign Minister Miguel D’Escoto Brockmann in 2008, during his Presidency of this General Assembly. The transformation of the UN is indispensable, in order for it to serve effectively the interests of Humanity. The Headquarters of this Organization must also change and be transferred from New York to the African Continent.</p>

<p>    9. The recent expulsion by the Government of the United States of two representatives of the Sister Republic of Cuba to this body, are another example that the United Nations needs a profound transformation and change of headquarters, in order to meet the objectives for which it was created and become the Multilateral Forum that serves all countries of the world, without limitations or quarantines for delegates of member countries.</p>

<p>    10. We express our rejection and condemnation for the expulsion of two Cuban diplomats from the UN headquarters in New York, in a clear violation of International Law, and particularly, the Headquarters Agreement between the UN and the Government of the host Country.</p>

<p>    11. Illegal events, such as these, confirm the urgent need for the United Nations to be re-founded, and the Headquarters State must change to a sister country where International Law is respected as well as the United Nations Chart, the United Nations that demands its reinvention and urgent democratization.</p>

<p>    12. We condemn, once again, the criminal blockade against the Sister Republic of Cuba and all its extraterritorial measures and ramifications. Nicaragua rejects all coercive economic measures that seek to break the Will and Spirit of Freedom and Sovereignty of the Peoples and Governments of the world.</p>

<p>    13. We reiterate our militant solidarity with the Sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, its Bolivarian People, and the Constitutional and Legitimate Government of President Nicolás Maduro.</p>

<p>    14. We denounce and condemn any threat of military intervention and the invocation of the obsolete Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty (TIAR), which is nothing more than an instrument designed by the Government of the United States to threaten or make use of force, advanced within the framework of the Organization of American States (OAS).</p>

<p>    15. We continue to support decolonization throughout the world, in solidarity with the Palestinian and Saharawi Peoples, with Puerto Rico and the Falkland Islands that belong to Argentina.</p>

<p>To conclude, Mr. President, Ministers and Delegates:</p>

<p>    16. 74 years have passed since the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations. Its Purposes and Principles have contributed in some measure to the maintenance of international Peace and security, however, new modalities which are incompatible with the Purposes of the United Nations, are being put into practice by some of the great powers that seek to subjugate developing countries, undermining their rights to self-determination and political independence.</p>

<p>    17. In Nicaragua, we continue along the path of Development with Social Justice, with the Protagonism of Families, with Gender Equity, the Protagonism of Youth, and generating more Security, more Education, Health, Energy, Water and Sanitation, Roads, Bridges, Housing, Agricultural Production, Caring for Nature in the face of Climate Change, Small and Medium Businesses, Creative Economy and everything that represents a Culture of Identity and Values, with Work, Rights, Welfare and Harmonious Coexistence between Nicaraguans and in peace, friendship and solidarity cooperation with the member countries of the United Nations Organization.</p>

<p>    18. The Government and People of Nicaragua defend the principle of independence and sovereignty, as established by the Charter of the United Nations, therefore we continue to demand the cessation of any policy of interference that violates international law, with interventionist actions in Nicaragua and in sister nations of our America and the World, such as Cuba, Venezuela, Syria, Iran, among others.<br />
<br />
    19. We reassure and reiterate that in Nicaragua we love Peace, we strengthen security, promote, defend and respect human rights in an integral manner, regardless of the media campaigns that, using fake news, seek to impose negative perceptions against our Country and our Government.</p>

<p>    20. In the region, Nicaragua continues to be an important factor of stability, peace and regional security with positive indicators in economic, political, and social development, poverty reduction, gender equity and citizen security.</p>

<p>    21. Nicaragua is a wall of containment against international organized crime, Maras and Gangs, terrorism and drug trafficking. These internal State Policies, that are of benefit and international cooperation, continue to be developed by the Government of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra.</p>

<p>    22. With responsibility we ensure that Nicaragua travels along the Route of poverty eradication with positive results, quality education, climate actions and especially with Social inclusion, because our Government has a vocation for the poor and the historical marginalized, for Peace, Good Government, Progress, International Security and the peaceful coexistence between the sister countries that make up the United Nations Organization.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
