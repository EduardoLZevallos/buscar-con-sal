It is election time in Nicaragua and therapeutic abortion is in the
news again. To the dissapointment of many Nicaraguan and international
human rights activists the leaders of the FSLN and the pro FSLN media
have confirmed their position in favor of the blanket abortion ban
which came into force in October 2006. What is more, an all out war of
words between government officials and the Nicaraguan women's rights
activists leading the campaign to legalize therapeutic abortion (who
are in their majority militants and supporters of the Sandinista
Renovation Movement, MRS) has been unleashed. Vindictive personal
attacks, bitter comments and dishonest reporting have, to a greater or
lesser extent, characterized both sides' treatment of the issue and the
debate surrounding it over the last few weeks.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
For many North American and European social justice activists involved
in Nicaragua the FSLN's position on therapeutic abortion is not just a
disappointment but also incomprehensible. However, if one takes a close
and unprejudiced look at historical and cultural factors not
immediately obvious or pleasing to most "cheles," one discovers many
reasons why the FSLN's position on the issue could be considered a
logical reaction to circumstance.<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Brief history of recent events surrounding therapeutic abortion
legislation</span> <br>
<br>
On October 26 2006, ten days before the last presidential election took
place, a law was passed by the National Assembly outlawing all forms of
abortion, even those carried out to preserve the psychological or
physical health of pregnant women and girls. The law was passed with
the support of deputies from the three main Nicaraguan parties with
representation in the Legislative: the FSLN, the PLC (Constitutional
Liberal Party) and the ALN (Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance). That day
Nicaragua joined the only other two countries in the world (Chile and
El Salvador) where women and girls have no access to legal abortions
even if the practice is necessary to preserve their own lives. <br>
<br>
The vote took place after a sustained public campaign organized and
financed by the Catholic and Evangelical Churches. The campaign
culminated on October 6 with a massive protest march (independent
sources estimated over 100,000 participants) and the presentation of a
petition to the National Assembly with 290,000 signatures demanding that therapeutic abortion be
outlawed. <br>
<br>
Subsequently the then president Enrique Bolaños, representative of the
most conservative faction of the Nicaraguan right wing, forced the
proposal of a blanket ban onto the National Assembly agenda. Numerous
national and international organizations as well as several deputies
within the Assembly called for the debate to be postponed until after
the elections given the highly controversial and emotive nature of the
issue concerned. These calls were ignored and the proposed ban was
voted in with a large majority.<br>
<br>
The passing of this legislation was the result of a combination of
years of campaigning by the Catholic and Evangelical Churches and a
unique historical moment (the run up to the 2006 elections) when Ortega
and the FSLN, after sixteen years in opposition, knew that victory was
just a few days away if they played their cards right. Unfortunately
for the cause of women's rights as we know it in the West, the FSLN
playing their cards right in October 2006 meant voting for a blanket
ban on abortion. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Nicaraguans support blanket ban</span><br>
<br>
A <a href="http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2007/abril/24/noticias/nacionales/186981.shtml">poll carried out by the M and R consultants</a> in April 2007 found that
69% of the population supported the ongoing penalization of therapeutic
abortion. When asked whether a therapeutic abortion should be carried
out on a woman with a high risk pregancy who could die as a result of
complications relating to her pregnancy 58.5% said no. These statistics
may sadden and frustrate those who feel committed to the cause of
women's right in Nicaragua. The same people would perhaps be more
deeply saddened by <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42996">Nicaraguan women's groups estimate</a> that over 110
women have died as a result of the blanket ban. Under such
circumstances, one finds oneself questioning the virtue of political
decisions based on public will.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
During <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/jan/08012402.html">a meeting with representatives of European donor country
governments</a> in January 2007 during which the principal issue discussed
was the therpeutic abortion ban, President Daniel Ortega implied that
his party's position on abortion over the years has deliberately
reflected the Nicaraguan population's take on the issue:<br>
<br>
"When we were in the middle of the revolution ... with the youth and
women incorporated, there were comrades that proposed we approve
abortion, one step beyond therapeutic abortion. We carried out detailed
surveys and found that 99% of the population was opposed to that
proposal. And when the issue begins to be discussed again [in 2006] ...
we did another survey which found that 80% of the population was
against abortion."<br>
<br>
Many international critics of Ortega identifying themselves as left
wingers have suggested that the FSLN position on therapeutic abortion
is cynical and opportunistic. The Guardian journalist Rory Carroll, for
example, had this to say about the FSLN decision to vote in favor of
the blanket ban: "Ortega, desperate to regain power, mobilised the
Sandinistas behind ... Cardinal [Miguel Obando y Bravo's] campaign [to
outlaw all forms of abortion] and helped get the ban enacted just days
before the [presidential election]. The former revolutionary, now
reinvented as a devout Catholic, was rewarded with the presidency."
(<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/oct/08/health.lifeandhealth">from The Guardian, October 8 2007</a>) <br>
<br>
Carroll's disparaging description of Ortega's part in the passing of
the legislation may appeal to those Westerners who were outraged at
FSLN support of the legislation. It may also appeal to the minority in
Nicaraguan society who oppose the ban. One has to remind oneself,
however, that no matter how uncomfortable it makes one feel, it is part
of Ortega's job to appeal to the set of cultural and moral values held
by the majority of the Nicaraguan people. <br>
<br>
The MRS is the only party that publicly supports the overturning of the
blanket ban. The MRS loses nothing in doing so given that the most part
of the 7% of Nicaraguan society it represents (mainly members of the
managerial and intellectual classes who identiy themselves as
leftwingers but do not identify with Ortega's anti-imperialist,
populist rhetoric), would mainly be opposed to the ban anyway. When
political decisions are in line with one's own beliefs, one seldom
describes those decisions as opportunistic.<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Nicaraguans base moral code on natural law</span><br>
<br>
It is often the case that <span style="font-style: italic;">internacionalistas</span> underestimate the profound
influence the Catholic Church and the other churches active in
Nicaragua have had and continue to have in forming society's moral
codes. It is hard for Europeans, brought up in post feminist revolution
societies, for example, to relate to a people that opposes the practise
of an abortion which is necessary to save a woman's life. Ideas amd
perceptions one assumes to be common sense often turn out to be
culturally inherited. <br>
<br>
A fundamental aspect of Nicaraguans' opposition to any form of abortion
is the idea that God is the only being with the right to end a life, in
other words, natural law. This idea is widely rejected in the West
where medical intervention is almost always preferred over the natural
course of any given disease or condition. In many parts of Nicaragua,
however, people take this idea to an extreme and opt not to seek
medical attention, even in the case of a medical emergency. The case of
an 87 year old woman whom we can call Doña Julia illustrates this: <br>
<br>
Julia lives in a remote rural community in the municipality of San
Nicolas in the department of Estelí Recently she was very sick with
terrible stomach pains and
unable to eat for several weeks. Her daughters called in the local
pastor who brought members of the community to the house to pray for
her every night. When Julia began vomiting blood two of her eight
children insisted she be taken to the nearest hospital, which is five
hours away on foot. The other six together with their local Pastor
dismissed
the idea urging for Julia's fate to be left to God. In the end the
two were able to persuade the others to let them seek medical advice.
Julia was brought to Esteli San Juan de Dios hospital on horseback.
She was later diagnosed with cancer. <br>
<br>If a proportion of the Nicaraguan population is hesitant to
seek medical intervention for cases such as these, it seems logical
that the same people would consider medical intervention which provokes
the death of an unborn child very undesirable indeed. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Dishonest church campaign creates misunderstanding of issues involved</span><br>
<br>
Another factor leading to such widespread support of the therapeutic
abortion ban among ordinary Nicaraguans is the dishonest and
manipulative manner in which the Catholic and other churches carried
out the anti-abortion campaign in 2006 and continue to discuss the
issue. Church representatives are loth to use the word "therapeutic"
during any discussions on the matter. Embrions are refered to as
children and images of foetuses of around six month gestation are used
on church leaflets and other publicity about the issue. The campaign's
main slogan, which can be seen across the country on banners and
stickers on street walls, in community halls and in people's homes, is
"abortar es matar" (abortion kills). <br>
<br>
Media outlets controlled by forces which favor the penalization of
therapeutic abortion (La Prensa, Channel 2, Channel 4, weekly newspaper
El 19 and dozens of local radios, for example) repeat this same
vocabulary reinforcing misinformation about the issue. <br>
<br>
As UN representative in Nicaragua Alfredo Missair has
commented, "unfortunately therapeutic abortion is misrepresentated as
an abortion issue, when it is really about interupting a pregnancy that
could cause the death of the mother and baby." (<a href="http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2007/10/26/nacionales/62429">El Nuevo Diario,
October 31 2007</a>)<br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Suspicion about foreign financing of reproductive rights programs</span><br>
<br>
There is a line of thought within religious circles in Nicaragua that
the promotion of reproductive rights is part of a scheme by rich
countries to control population growth in impoverished countries.
Elizabeth de Rojas, representative of one faction of the Nicaraguan
evangelist church, believes that rich countries are very concerned
about population growth and are using the international forums which
they control to promote contraception, abortion and homosexuality as a
way of rapidly diminishing global population growth (<a href="http://www.lavozdelsandinismo.com/el-19/">El 19, edition no.
6</a>). According to de Rojas this explains why foreign (mainly European)
governments spend so much money on promoting the use of contraception
and the practise of abortion in Nicaragua and other parts of the
majority world.<br>
<br>
Reverend Omar Duarte, of the Evangelist Ministry "Rivers of Living
Water" agrees that certain foreign aid agencies are the ones which have
"created the pro-abortion campaigns" in Nicaragua (<a href="http://www.lavozdelsandinismo.com/el-19/">El 19, edition no.
6</a>).<br>
<br>
The church's manipulation of society's suspicions about birth control
programs has been going on for over two decades. In 1983 the Episcopal
Conference of Bishops in Nicaragua denounced, in the institution's
annual message to the nation, that programs promoting the use of
contraception and other reproductive rights were being imposed on
Nicaragua by foreign cooperation agencies. On several occasions the
Catholic Church has stated its disapproval of rich countries
conditioning aid on the implementation of birth control programs. <br>
<br>
In order to tune into this way of thinking one must consider for a
moment the widespread suspicions society had about methods of
contraception in the US and Western European countries during the
decades after the pill was first introduced. These were societies where
feminist revolutions had had a huge impact on the way people thought
about women, their place in society and their reproductive rights. It
was the feminist movements within these societies which had felt,
discussed and acted upon the need for such methods to exist.<br>
<br>
Once one begins to ponder the entirely different set of social and
historical circumstances in Nicaragua in the late 20th and early 21st
centuries, reactions formerly incomprehensible start to seem like
logical responses, especially given the predominance of the Roman
Catholic religion. It becomes understandable that Nicaraguans&nbsp;
should wonder why foreign governments are spending millions of dollars
to stop them having babies. <br>
<br>
Ortega's wife Rosario Murillo taps into Nicaraguan society's mistrust
of feminist groups promoting reproductive rights in her recent article
<a href="http://www.lavozdelsandinismo.com/nicaragua/2008-08-28/la-conexion-feminista-y-las-guerras-de-baja-intensidad/">"the feminist connection and low intensity warfare"</a> in which she links
the women's groups who receive foreign government aid money to campaign
against the blanket abortion ban (and who have declared themselves in
opposition to the FSLN government) to the wider media campaign to
undermine the government:<br>
<br>"We are faced with permanent provocation [from these women's groups ...
which] take advantage of their role as political operators of [human]
rights and make use of the spaces their rich friends open to them to
try to change [our] cultural values and impose foreign and strange
social norms on our communities and families... They proclaim abortion
without respect for the culture or the collective soul of the
people."&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Church approval has been key element of all recent political
changes&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
In order to understand the importance of Church approval for any
mainstream political party in Nicaragua it is worth taking a brief look
over the Church's unquestionable influence over the success of all
major political upheavels in Nicaragua's recent history. Shortly before
the triumph of the Popular Sandinista Revolution in 1979 Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo, aware of the inevitability of the overthrow of
Somoza's government, made a public call to the Nicaraguan people to
take up arms against the dictatorship. The Catholic Church hierarchy
later became one of the most important promoters of the cause of the
Contra counter-revolutionary war of the 1980s. In the 1990s and early
2000s the
Catholic Church hierarchy maintained an open and fervent anti FSLN
stance aiding three consecutive right wing presidents into power.
Ortega and the FSLN knew, therefore, that in order to take the
presidency in 2006 one of the most important things to do would be to
secure the approval of the Catholic Church. <br>
<br>
Aparicio Lopez Cruz is a 48 year old farmer from the north of
Nicaragua. A life long supporter and militant of the FSLN, he was the
coordinator of civilian defense in his community and four other
surrounding communities during the Contra War. Lopez explains his take
on the FSLN's relationship with the Church now and over the last few
decades:<br>
<br>
"In my opinion, the FSLN has always been with God, but for the Empire,
for our adversaries it is inconvenient to publicise that fact. They
have to say that the FSLN is an atheist organization, that the FSLN is
with the devil, so that, by doing so, they can take advantage of the
sensitivity of the impoverished majority's Christian faith and create
opposition to the FSLN. That is what I observed to be the case in the
1980s and right up until a couple of years ago. <br>
<br>
[During the Contra War,] mass was not just a Christian sermon, only
about 50% of mass was ever dedicated to talking about God, the other
50% was dedicated to anti government propaganda, [for example]
lamenting all the deaths and cursing those responsible, and they
referred to the FSLN, without mentioning its name, as being responsible
for all the deaths. And [it worked] ... it captured people's minds, a
grieving people, a people that was losing their children and the Church
was saying to them, for example, "we ask God that one day may He touch
the hearts of these men that think they have the right to take
away the lives of so many people, when only God has the right to do
so." <br>
<br>
When asked if he sees a link between the FSLN's position on therapeutic
abortion and the need to maintain good relations with the church, Lopez
had this to say:&nbsp; <br>
<br>
"I think the government's slogan - government of unity and national
reconciliation - is very apt considering the situation we are
confronting in Nicaragua. I think that [the FSLN] is trying to look at
Nicaraguans' problems taking into account the opinion of the Nicaraguan
people. And I think that it is important that everyone should be taken
into account and that everyone needs to give something so that we can
advance towards some kind of socio economic development. It is really
important that [the FSLN] has good relations with the different
authorities that represent the country. The problem is, that the thing
that has to give, what is it? And how much damage does it cause you?
And how much good does it bring you? But the fact is that something has
to give, that is unquestionable.<br>
<br>
By supporting [the blanket ban on abortion] ... a number of women will
die. But it also makes it possible to help thousands and thousands of
children and thousands and thousands of mothers to have a better life
through government social programs."<br>
<br>
The issue of therapeutic abortion is so controversial and causes such
strong gut reactions from most Nicaraguans that the chances of the
country's political leaders creating an adequate environment for an
objective and meaningful debate on the matter are slim. In the meantime
it would seem apt for <span style="font-style: italic;">internacionalistas</span> to continue to support all
those parts of the FSLN government program which are making a real
difference to the people they claim to be in solidarity with. <br>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Internacionalista icon Granados praises government for programs that
benefit women</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Dorothea Granados, a nurse of US origin who has worked with women in
rural Nicaragua for decades, came off the fence very publicly, last
week, praising the government for its social programs she says make a
big difference to the health and wellbeing of the women she works with.
She also questioned the authority of women's groups leading the
campaign to legalize therapeutic abortion in Nicaragua, which, in her
opinion, "defend the interests of the US Empire which aims to
destablize the Nicaraguan government" and "do not attend to the needs
of women who struggle [in undignified conditions] ... every day to earn
enough to buy food." <br>
<br>"If they care about the people, if they care about women, they need to
take themselves and their money to the mountains ... to see people's
needs, ... not just here in Managua with marches and protests.... The
important thing here is whether or not abortion is what women need, and
the women with barefeet and dirt under their nails are not interested
in abortion, they are interested in food, a roof over their heads,
antenatal care during the first three months of their pregnancy so that
they don't die. <br>
<br>
That is why I think that these movements are mistaken because they
don't acknowledge the social programs, they don't see, for example that
in Mulukuku the maternal mortality rate has dropped to zero because we
are working with the Ministry of Health. They don't see the integrated
care being offered to women so they can avoid falling pregnant if they
don't want to. They don't see the free medicines that are given out. So
I invite them to come and work with us so that they realize that there
is no need for abortion." (<a href="http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2008/09/23/nacionales/85790">El Nuevo Diario, September 23,
