      <br>
Zelaya is in Tegucigalpa and his return to Honduras, which made a
mockery of the &#8220;security measures&#8221; installed along the length and
breadth of the Honduran borders, should mark the beginning of the end
of the coup regime. The reasons that underlie this desired outcome are
succinctly outlined below. <br>
      <br>
Firstly, the Honduran gorillas and their instigators and protectors in
the US (principally the Southern Command and the State Department)
underestimated the scale, intensity and perseverance of the popular
resistance which, day after day, tirelessly, manifested its opposition
to the coup. <br>
      <br>
In truth, going by contemporary Honduran history, the scale of the
popular rejection to the coup was not in anybody&#8217;s calculations. But
the new course mapped out for the nation took during Zelaya&#8217;s
presidency &#8211; his positive response to popular demands ignored for
decades by previous governments together with the reorientation of the
country&#8217;s international relations as a result of Honduras&#8217;
incorporation into the framework of ALBA &#8211; had an impressive pedagogic
effect and is what has provoked such an unexpected popular reaction to
the usurper regime.<br>
      <br>
Secondly, the coup regime demonstrated its incapacity to overcome a
situation of double isolation. On the domestic front, with every day
that passed it became clearer that the social base that sustained the
regime was reduced to the Honduran oligarchy and a few groups
subordinated by its hegemony, including media outlets dominated solely
by the power of capital wealth. What is more, as time went on, far from
being weakened, popular resistance to the coup increased dramatically.<br>
      <br>
On the international front, Micheletti&#8217;s regime is almost completely
isolated. Save very few exceptions, all Latin American and Caribbean
countries withdrew their ambassadors, as did many of the most
influential European countries. The Organization of American States
(OAS) adopted a hard-line regarding the de facto government. <br>
      <br>
Soon after it was installed, the only external support the regime could
rely on was from the US. But even US support declined considerably as
time went on. At first US visas for diplomatic personnel accredited in
Washington were revoked. More recently measures that came to weaken the
positions of Micheletti and his collaborators were
introduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Thirdly, the ambiguous policies of the US government &#8211; a result of the
internal dispute within the Obama administration &#8211; which facilitated
the perpetration of the coup, gradually turned into less amiable
policies towards the usurper regime.<br>
      <br>
While it is true that the initial rejection of the coup expressed by
Obama had the edge taken off it by his former (and current?) rival,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a number of factors gradually
inclined the balance against the position adopted by the Secretary of
State and created an atmosphere of increasingly antagonistic relations
with the coup leaders. Among those factors are the undeniably
retrograde nature of Micheletti and his government, the unending
succession of insults directed at Obama each time the White House
expressed any criticism of the coup regime and the de facto
government&#8217;s manifest failure to build a social base. <br>
      <br>
Fourthly and finally, the regime installed on June 28th represents a
headache for Obama not least because its success to maintain itself in
power emphatically discredits Obama&#8217;s promise to establish new
relations between the US and the rest of the Americas.<br>
      <br>
The initial support of the coup (made evident by Washington&#8217;s obstinate
refusal to define it as a &#8220;coup d&#8217;etat&#8221;), the US government&#8217;s lukewarm
diplomatic response and US indifference in the face of very grave human
rights violations committed by Micheletti&#8217;s government, have seriously
damaged the image Obama wanted to establish of himself and his
government in Latin America and the Caribbean. <br>
      <br>
The continuity of the coup regime would make Obama look like an
irresponsible and demagogic politician. Or, even worse, it would make
him look like a president incapable of controlling what his
subordinates in the Pentagon, the Southern Command and the State
Department do and say. <br>
      <br>
And this brings us to a second, very important matter which supersedes
the framework of hemispheric politics: the Obama administration&#8217;s
credibility on the international arena. By demonstrating inability to
control what happens in his own &#8220;backyard,&#8221; the leaders of other
countries (especially China, Russia and India) have reason to suspect
that Obama would be incapable of controlling the most aggressive,
reactionary sectors within the US (sectors to whom Obama&#8217;s promise to
encourage multilateralism is equivalent to an unconditional
capitulation before their most hated enemies) under circumstances
relevant to their national interests. <br>
      <br>
This is particularly grave at a time when Obama is negotiating with
Russia a new agreement to reduce both countries&#8217; nuclear capacity
(something that Washington needs as much as, if not more than, Moscow
given the financial haemorrhage produced by the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan and the uncontainable US fiscal deficit).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The failure of this agreement would invoke an enormous financial cost
to the public budget at a time when liquid funds are required to reduce
the risk further deepening the current economic crisis. <br>
      <br>
In order to persuade the Russians that his plan to reduce nuclear
capacity is viable, Obama must first demonstrate that he is in control
of the situation and that the hawks in the Pentagon are not capable of
twisting his arm. <br>
      <br>
Each day Micheletti remains in power is equivalent to another month of
difficult talks with Medvedev and Putin, with Obama trying to persuade
his Russian counterparts that his promises will be translated into
deeds. Because, if Obama cannot control his own in Honduras, would he
really be able to control their reactions to vital and strategic US
national security matters? <br>
