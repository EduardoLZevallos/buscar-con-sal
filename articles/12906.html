<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY</strong><br />
<strong>OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA AT THE VI MEETING OF HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY OF LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN STATES (CELAC)</strong></p>

<p>Brother President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC),</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Vice Presidents, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation of the CELAC Member States,<br />
Representatives of Regional and International Organizations,</p>

<p>Dear Friends.</p>

<p>1. We convey the fraternal greetings of Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of the Republic of Nicaragua, and Comrade Vice President Rosario Murillo.</p>

<p>2. We salute the member countries for holding this VI CELAC Summit, once again revitalized as a regional forum of Free, Sovereign, Independent and Self-determined peoples. We acknowledge the entrepreneurial actions and leadership of Mexico in this process of reactivating CELAC in times of Pandemic, contributing to its strengthening.</p>

<p>3. In this month of September, in which we celebrate the Bicentennial of the First Independence of the countries of Central America, from the Motherland of Sandino and Darío, we share these Times of defense of our Sovereignty, fighting against the Colonial and Neocolonial, Imperialist and Supremacist Powers of Always, strengthening our unity and defending our rights, our cultures, idiosyncrasies and our natural resources.</p>

<p>4. CELAC was created for the Union, for the realization of the Supreme Dreams of Bolívar, Benito Juárez, Martí, Sandino and of all the Heroes of Our Caribbean America. It was created for Life, Liberty, Fraternity, Complementarity and Solidarity. The Community of Latin American and Caribbean States was created to work with dignity and with our own Voices, in Fraternity and Unity of our Peoples, for the Common Good. CELAC is not an instrument of the Empire, it was born defending the sacred right of our peoples to live in Peace, advancing against Poverty, promoting development and prosperity, with Justice and Equity. Honor and Glory to the Founders of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States!</p>

<p>5. From CELAC we condemn and reject all the perverse attempts to destroy the Peoples and Revolutions of Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua. We repudiate and demand the immediate cessation of the inhuman and criminal blockade against the brotherly People of Cuba, as well as the aggressions, unilateral measures against our countries, sometimes in unjustifiable alliance with Governments of the Region.</p>

<p>6. For the good of all, this interventionist practice of allying with the aggressor must end. It threatens the unity, development and future of Peace, Security and Prosperity of our countries and our region.</p>

<p>7. We condemn all forms of coercive economic measures, unilateral actions, so-called sanctions, in violation of International Law and the Charter of the United Nations, aimed at undermining the sovereignty and the right of our peoples to self-determination.<br />
<br />
8. We denounce that these measures threaten the development of our peoples and are just another mechanism of political, economic and social destabilization, used by the powerful elites of the United States, derailing our governments’ struggle against poverty and the pandemic, and deepening social inequality.</p>

<p>9. Nicaragua has repeatedly denounced and will continue to denounce, that they will never be able to intimidate us or weaken us, we remain firm and willing to defend our Motherland, which is the Motherland of Great Heroes and Heroines who, throughout our history, led the just Anti-imperialist, Anti-Somoza and Anti-oligarchic struggle, aspiring toward the creation of a more equitable, more prosperous, more democratic and more inclusive and participatory society.</p>

<p>10. It is necessary to continue strengthening our shared vision on key issues for the Development, Wellbeing and Good Living of our Peoples. From the fight against the COVID19 pandemic and the global climate crisis, to the urgent need to unify efforts, resources and capacities to comply with the Sustainable Development Goals, the fight against organized crime and terrorism in its different manifestations.<br />
<br />
11. Nicaragua fully supports the call to democratize the production and fair and equitable access to vaccines against COVID19, as well as the call to the International Community and the global pharmaceutical sector to join forces in order to accelerate the global distribution of treatments against COVID19, under the principle of international solidarity and guaranteeing universal access to the vaccine, as a common good of humanity.</p>

<p>12. We also celebrate the creation of the Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency (ALCE), the establishment of the CELAC Voluntary Fund for Humanitarian Assistance in Situations of Natural Disaster and the ongoing efforts to launch the Ibero-American Institute of Indigenous Languages (IILI), all of which are initiatives that contribute to the socio-economic and cultural development of the Peoples of Our Latin and Caribbean America.</p>

<p>Dear Sisters and Brothers,</p>

<p>13. Both the declarations approved by consensus, as well as our deliberations reflect an understanding of the challenges and threats we face as a region and are the basis to continue consolidating regional unity and cooperation, even though we recognize that there is a way to go.</p>

<p>14. Nicaragua expresses, within this Forum that must unequivocally represent the Sovereignty of the Latin American and Caribbean Peoples and States, its firm position of non-support, non-vote, for the Republic of Argentina as Pro Tempore President of CELAC, because the Government of Argentina, not its People whom we respect, has contradicted and undermined the bases of CELAC, issuing Public Statements made by its President and Minister of Foreign Affairs, reporting with great media fanfare, that "they are working with the United States to resolve the situation in Nicaragua."</p>

<p>15. As it can evidently be seen, the Government of Argentina has become an instrument of northamerican Imperialism, subordinating itself to hegemonic interests, designing, in their own words, "a strategy" to violate and disrupt the National Sovereignty of our Nicaragua, a Sovereignty that we have heroically defended and continue to defend with Love and Honor.</p>

<p>16. As that Sovereignty has been publicly violated by the Government of the Republic of Argentina, our Position, clear and firm, is one of non-vote, non-support for the Government of that Country as Pro-Tempore President of CELAC. Because it has dared to interfere in our affairs, making its own political publicity, intervening in the Internal Affairs of our country in a vulgar and offensive manner, and clearly and insultingly in collusion with the Yankees.</p>

<p>17. The Government of the Republic of Argentina has lent itself to violate our National Dignity and Sovereignty, which, as our Augusto C. Sandino, General of Free Men and Women, stated, "is not open to discussion, it is defended with arms in hand".</p>

<p>18. We defend with National Pride, our Honor and Decorum, which has cost us so much blood and which has obviously been slighted by the unacceptable joint plans of the Government of the Republic of Argentina, along with the Imperialist Government of the United States.</p>

<p>For these fundamental reasons, we cannot give our vote to the Government of the Republic of Argentina.</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers, Heads of State and Government, Delegates:</p>

<p>19. We continue upon the path traced by the Liberators of Latin America and the Caribbean, advancing in CELAC for unity in diversity, integration and continuous struggle, defending the Freedom, Sovereignty, Self-determination and Social Justice of our Peoples.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
