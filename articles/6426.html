<p><em><strong>Donald Trump has launched an aggressive campaign that targets Latino migrants – particularly Venezuelans – as scapegoats in a broader geopolitical agenda. Bolstered through a controversial alliance with the Salvadoran president, Trump has overseen mass deportations, detentions in Guantánamo Bay and El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, and invoked 18th-century war powers to justify these actions.</strong></em></p>

<p>Trump’s <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/donald-trump-has-launched-a-war-against-the-working-class/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">brutal attacks</a> on the working class have been supplemented by the systematic demonization of immigrants – many of whom are themselves working class. During his electoral campaign, Trump not only promised large-scale deportations but, pandering to a far-right base, <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2024/09/11/truth-fact-check-people-eating-dogs-springfield-ohio-trump-vance-harris-debate/75171964007/?utm">vilified migrants</a> to unprecedented degrees.wt</p>

<p>In his 2015 campaign, Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/11/455613993/it-came-up-in-the-debate-here-are-3-things-to-know-about-operation-wetback">vowed</a> to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. And upon returning to the presidency in 2025, Trump again promised to round up millions in what he boasted would be the largest deportation operation in US history.</p>

<p>However, as the record shows, immigrant deportations are, unfortunately, a bipartisan project. Contrary to Trump’s grandiose rhetoric, once in office for his first term, he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_and_removal_from_the_United_States?utm">deported fewer</a> than one million rather than the 11 million he claimed would be expelled. That was <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/12/16/u-s-immigrant-deportations-fall-to-lowest-level-since-2007/?utm"> fewer than</a> the 1.6 million evicted by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama in a his first 4 years in office. While Democrat Joe Biden still <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/19/deportations-biden-trump?utm">holds the record</a> for the most deportations in a year, Trump is determined to beat it.</p>

<p>To this end, Trump and his ultra-conservative <a href="https://immigrationimpact.com/2024/08/23/what-project-2025-says-about-immigration/?utm">Project 2025</a> confederates would like to <a href="https://time.com/7208965/birthright-citizenship-trump-order/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">end birthright citizenship</a>, which would disproportionately affect nearly <a href="https://salud-america.org/us-latino-population-rises-to-19-5/?utm">65 million</a> Latinos in the US. Arbitrary arrests, deportations, and the revocation of documentation – even for <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/13/us-news/trump-team-confirms-wrongly-deported-man-still-alive-as-prez-says-el-salvadors-leader-will-determine-future-of-prisoners/?utm">legal residents</a> – are escalating daily, with Latino immigrants being the primary target in operations rife with racial profiling.</p>

<p>Trump is also trying to terminate the Humanitarian Parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV), although the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-halts-trump-from-ending-humanitarian-parole-for-people-from-four-countries/?utm">revocation has been halted</a> pending legal proceedings.​ Ironically, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, once a vocal advocate for Cuban immigrants, now spearheads policies stripping them of legal protection.</p>

<p><strong>Trump’s Fictional Gang Scare</strong></p>

<p>Trump’s demonization of migrants affords him a patina of populism by falsely posing as a supporter of US workers erroneously threatened by aliens. Of course, Elon Musk’s buddy is no friend of the working class.</p>

<p>There is another more deeply political underpinning to Trump’s campaign related to Venezuela. Trump has <a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/columns/a-tattooed-venezuelan-terrorist/">falsely accused</a> some Venezuelan migrants of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang on the flimsiest of reasons such as a tattoo in support of a football club. Thus immigrants, especially from Venezuela, are conflated with criminality. In fact, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-focuses-migrants-crime-here-is-what-research-shows-2024-04-11/">studies show</a> US immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than the native-born.</p>

<p>In a highly redacted document, the US <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2025-04/tren_de_aragua_tda_intelligence_report_12112024_redacted.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">designated</a> the Tren de Aragua to be a “transnational criminal organization” (TCO) in December 2024. This came after the Venezuelan government largely <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuelas-interior-minister-criminal-gang-tren-de-aragua-dismantled-nino-guerrero/?utm">dismantled</a> the gang in September 2023 at Tocorón Penitentiary, demonstrating the government’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/opinion/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-maduro.html">antagonistic</a> relationship to the gang. But its existence was being politically weaponized by the US.  </p>

<p>On his first day in office, Trump initiated the process of designating the gang as a <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/934126/download?inline">foreign terrorist organization</a> (FTO), legally making it a crime to provide it material support. In so doing, a circle of conflation was being constructed from migrant, to criminal, to gang member, and then the big leap to terrorist.</p>

<p>The final link in the circle of conflation was Trump’s invocation on March 15 of the Alien Enemies Act accusing the Venezuelan government of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">“invasion”</a> of the US by the Tren de Aragua.  </p>

<p>A media campaign – spearheaded by Trump in concert with far-right Venezuelan opposition leader <a href="https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2025/03/16/the-making-of-maria-corina-machado/?utm">Maria Corina Machado</a> and US senators like <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/17/us-news/gop-pols-demand-full-accounting-of-venezuelans-released-into-us-as-violent-tren-de-aragua-gang-takes-hold/?utm">Ted Cruz</a>– has propagated the myth of a Venezuelan government-backed Tren de Aragua cartel flooding the US with criminals. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has described this as “the <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/president-maduro-refutes-allegation-that-venezuela-sent-criminals-to-the-us-compares-it-to-false-wmd-claims-during-iraq-war/?utm">biggest lie</a> ever told about our country.”  To wit, El Pais <a href="https://elpais.com/america/2025-03-30/verdad-mentira-y-mito-sobre-el-tren-de-aragua.html?utm">verified</a> the gang is “without the capacity to be a national security problem” the US. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/opinion/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-maduro.html">demonstrated</a> that the Tren de Aragua is “not invading America.” And Trump’s own US Intelligence Community assessment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/intelligence-trump-venezuelan-gang-alien-enemies.html">concluded</a> that the gang was not acting on the Venezuelan government’s orders.</p>

<p><strong>Alien Enemies Act</strong></p>

<p>Trump’s invocation of the Alien and Enemies Act serves dual purposes. It is a legal pretext to justify mass expulsions. At the same time, it is a salvo in Washington’s renewed “maximum pressure” <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/04/02/trump-sticks-to-maximum-pressure-on-venezuela-for-now-00267324?utm">regime-change campaign</a> against Caracas.</p>

<p>The application of the Alien Enemies Act for deporting individuals based on alleged gang affiliations is unprecedented and has raised legal and ethical concerns. While being adjudicated in the courts, the archaic 1789 <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/alien-enemies-act-explained?utm">war-time legislation</a> is being used to target Venezuelans and Nicaraguans, even though the US is not at war with these countries…at least not officially. Nevertheless, some have been sent to detention facilities like the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/guantanamo-bay-human-rights">notorious</a> internment camp in Guantánamo Bay.</p>

<p>The administration’s lack of transparency regarding deportation criteria has been staggering, as has its blatant <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/60-minutes-venezuelans-el-salvador-prison?utm_source=chatgpt.com">disregard</a> for due process. Many deportees were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abrego-garcia-maryland-father-deported-el-salvador-6de340ac95f2abb5fd3688fc1679fd66">detained without evidence</a>, arrest warrants, or probable cause – let alone justification for imprisonment.</p>

<p>The degrading treatment of detainees in Guantánamo has drawn <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/groups-sue-trump-administration-for-access-to-immigrants-sent-from-u-s-to-guantanamo-bay?utm">wide condemnation</a> as has the administration’s obsessive drive to deport Latinos - whether undocumented, temporary, or permanent.</p>

<p><strong>Migrants Vanish into Trump’s Offshore Prison</strong></p>

<p>Trump is also shipping Venezuelan migrants and lesser numbers of Salvadorians to El Salvador’s CECOT prison, a so-called “Terrorism Confinement Centre,” where <a href="https://time.com/7269604/el-salvador-photos-venezuelan-detainees/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">conditions</a> are subhuman. No visitation, recreation, or education are allowed at the extremely overcrowded facility. Lack of medical care and abuse are rampart, with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/03/unlawful-expulsions-to-el-salvador-endanger-lives-amid-ongoing-state-of-emergency/">reports</a> of over 300 deaths in custody, some showing clear signs of violence.</p>

<p>The Trump administration struck a deal with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, paying $6 million to detain 238 Venezuelans branded “foreign terrorists.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bukele <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-03-19/how-bukele-benefits-from-accepting-us-deportation-flights-20000-per-inmate-a-year-and-trumps-favor.html">boasted</a> about the financial benefits of the arrangement. His Ocio Cero (zero leisure) prison labour program will, he said, contribute to the economic self-sustainability of the prison system, which critics say is tantamount to <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/trump-human-trafficking-el-salvador/?utm">human trafficking</a>.</p>

<p>Trump and Bukele both falsely claim to have no power to bring back a mistakenly deported Salvadoran legal immigrant. Kilmar Armando Abrego García is now held at CECOT, even though a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-consider-trumps-compliance-with-order-over-wrongly-deported-man-2025-04-15/?utm">US judge</a> ordered his return and despite the US <a href="https://nypost.com/video/scotus-bring-back-wrongfully-deported-ms-man-reporter-replay/?utm">Supreme Court’s</a> ruling to do so. Instead, Trump and Bukele declared their intention to expand the scheme. Trump floated deporting even US citizens to CECOT, with Bukele <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/trump-planning-to-deport-homegrown-criminals-to-el-salvador-jail-us-presidents-big-remark/articleshow/120312606.cms">responding</a>: "Yeah, we've got space."</p>

<p>BPR (Bloque de Resistencia y Rebeldía Popular), a Salvadoran human rights organization <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/el-salvadors-brp-on-the-violation-of-salvadoran-sovereignty-by-trump-and-bukele/">denounced</a> the Trump-Bukele pact as “arbitrary and dehumanizing,” violating international law and making El Salvador complicit in Trump’s criminalizing immigration policies. They <a href="https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/04/04/demandan-en-corte-por-detencion-de-venezolanos-en-el-salvador/">demanded</a> the Supreme Court nullify the detentions, arguing they violate constitutional protections against foreign judicial overreach.</p>

<p>Venezuela’s government has also taken action. Attorney General Tarek Williams Saab petitioned El Salvador’s Supreme Court for habeas corpus relief for detained Venezuelans. President Maduro <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-to-receive-un-assistance-for-migrants-illegally-imprisoned-in-el-salvador/">condemned</a> the deportations as kidnappings and sought intervention from the U.N. by contacting Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.</p>

<p>President Maduro has vowed to fight for the repatriation of every wrongfully detained Venezuelan. This struggle must be joined by the international solidarity movement, demanding the immediate release of all unjustly imprisoned migrants.</p>
