<p><strong>8th November, 2021</strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"><img alt="" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/articulos/318273.jpeg" style="float:right; margin:10px; width:400px; height:420px" />Good evening, Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers. The 8<sup>th</sup> of November, 45<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Transit toward Immortality of our Brother, Comandante Carlos Fonseca Amador... Present! Present! Present!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Here is Carlos, in these Struggles, in these Battles that we have been waging, in these Struggles that thanks to the Consciousness, the Mysticism, the Example of our Brother Carlos Fonseca, who "is one of those dead that never die", as Tomás said; that's where the energy comes from, that’s what allows us to achieve great Victories. Because Carlos knew how to nourish himself, and nurture us, with the Example of our Indigenous Ancestors, led by Chief Diriangén, resisting, confronting and giving his Life, facing the colonizers who believed they had the "Divine right" to come and takeover these lands.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">It would be good for the Spanish Authorities to reconsider and to reflect a little. Because the Spanish People know what Colonization really meant for Education, it surely did not mean Wellbeing, it did not mean lands for the rightful owners of these Lands and it did not mean transferring the prosperity that they had on the European Continent, to the owners of these Lands.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">What right did the Spanish colonizers have with their Swords and with the Bible, a poisonous combination to oppress the Peoples throughout our Region. Yes, the colonizers came from Europe and expanded throughout the world, and took over the African Continent, they also occupied Asia, occupied the North of Our America, what we now know as the United States of North America. No! “Those lands belong to them by Right, yes, by Divine Right,” even though these Peoples arose in those lands. The Native Peoples, Our Indigenous Ancestors, they continue to be the owners of those lands that are being occupied by the Colonizers.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And we are fighting that Battle, because they continue to act and behave as colonizers, they do not understand that the populations that later arose, mixtures of Spaniards with Indigenous People, mixtures of Indigenous Peoples with our African Brothers who arrived here as slaves, they do not understand that these Peoples, who were arising and fighting for their Freedom, fighting for their Independence, defeating the great Spanish Armies, they do not understand that these Peoples formed their Conscience and Conviction and stopped being a Colony of Europe a long time ago.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And we fully understand the behavior of the European Governments, not of the Peoples, of the European Governments, where even fascist parties rule, and the descendants of the Franco regime that massacred and assassinated the Spanish People; those are the children of Franco who have still remained there, occupying spaces of Power, even eventually coming to power in Spain.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Yes, the Francoist fascists twinned with Hitler, Hitler's little brothers, are there ruling and now they want to form an International Fascist here in Our America, the leaders of those Spanish fascist parties coming to visit those who identify themselves with those fascist and pro-imperialist currents and that have positions in North American governments, meeting with them, and speaking clearly of forming an International (Fascist), they say that "for Democracy", when we all know that they are trying to form an International that revives Fascism, Nazism, that shows its claws in many European countries.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">It is time for Europe to understand, once and for all, that in these Lands, among these Peoples, in these Nations, that here in Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan People govern and not the European Governments.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Well, I don't know... you have heard it correctly, it is not new, the recurrence of European governments in what is now known as the European Union, which has a majority of fascist, Nazi Parliamentarians. Yes, that is Democracy in Europe, they are ruling, in the majority, fascists, and in the European Parliament the majority are fascists, Nazis.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">That is why so much hatred against the Peoples who fight for Independence, because we continue to fight to defend our Independence, our Sovereignty. That is why so much hatred against Cuba, that is why so much hatred against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that is why so much hatred against the Peoples that fight for Freedom, such as Bolivia. They feel that these Peoples continue to rebel and that they continue to break the chains, and they want to re-impose those chains.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Now, as in the times of World War II, they were subjected, many European governments were subjected, they were also accomplices in Hitler's criminal adventure, they were partners, as they say of Hitler, they have now been and continue to be instruments. Logically, an instrument that coincides with colonialist policy, now instruments of the interventionist policy, of the warmongering policy of the United States of America.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And with all the respect and affection that we have for the North American People, North American Rulers, from the foundation, promoted slavery, that is to say, North American Democracy was born with slavery.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">That is why, when the Yankee came and invaded Nicaragua in 1856, William Walker, and was named President of Nicaragua, the first thing he did was reestablish slavery in Nicaragua. Because by those years, Nicaragua was already independent from Spain, slavery had already been abolished in these Countries of the Central American Region, and William Walker came here recognized as President of Nicaragua by President Pierce, who was then the President of the United States of North America.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">It is impossible for Nicaraguans and I would say for Latin Americans and Caribbean Peoples, it is impossible to stop talking about the Interventionist Policy, the Expansionist, Colonialist Policy, of the United States of North America, and the European countries. How much blood does Europe carry! How much blood, how many crimes committed in the countries they occupied in Africa, how much it cost the African Peoples to become independent.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">But reaching all, including Nicaragua and Central America, an Independence that had to be forged, developed, enriched, empowered. That is why here, we cannot say that we are Free, that we are Independent... No! We are under the threat of the Yankee Empire, under the aggressions of the Yankee Empire and under the threats of the European colonialists. And that's not what I say, it’s what they say.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">They believe that we are a Colony of theirs, and they want to dictate how we should behave, and they want to decide what kind of Democracy we should practice. That is, they continue with their colonialist practices to dominate these Territories, but not for the good, but to subdue and exploit them and commit them to their Expansionist and Warmongering Policies.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
How many Latin American Brothers seeking North American Citizenship have enlisted in the United States Army and have ended up invading Nations that are thousands of kilometers from the United States. How many! Cannon fodder!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">They look for “cannon fodder” in the same North American towns, for what?, to enrich the Military Industry, because in the United States it is not the People who decide, there are Elections, it’s true, but regardless of who comes to the Government in the United States, the Military Powers of the great Military Industry, the Economic Powers, those are the ones who decide.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">That is why there is so much war, so much tragedy, so many invasions, and they don't finish understanding, they don't finish learning... They recently left Afghanistan, and what have did they leave there? A situation in which they caused more pain, more death, more insecurity, and that is a country that is making an extraordinary effort to achieve stability.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">I was telling you that here in Nicaragua we have nothing in that we are talking about<br />
<br />
Europe and the United States because it occurs to us, it is an occurrence; we are facing a reality in Latin America and the Caribbean and therefore Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">How many invasions here in Nicaragua, look, said William Walker under the Pierce administration invading Nicaragua and recognizing Walker as President... 1856 and in those terrible conditions, a very small population in our Country, the Patriots who faced the first Yankee invaders who even wanted to impose a President on us.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">From there came the first anti-imperialist hymns... 1856! Those anti-imperialist hymns were not influenced by Marx, or Lenin, if the October Revolution had not yet triumphed. Those Hymns were born from the heart of our poor People, but with dignity, and they said: "Death to the thirsty golden Yankee, death to the cowardly and vile invader." Yes, that was what the Combatants said at that time, that because they did not have automatic rifles like the ones they brought, repeating rifles like the Yankees brought, they defended the country with stones by shooting down the invading soldiers.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Then again the Yankee troops intervening in our country; In other words, Nicaragua has had to confront the Yankee troops directly, not because we want war with them, but because they have wanted to take over Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And the other invasion came, in 1909, came a little note like these that they continually put out in the State Department, a little note addressed to the President of Nicaragua José Santos Zelaya: The Knox Note.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">The Secretary of State of the United States was a man, Philander Knox, and he was ordered to send a note to the President of Nicaragua, who had promoted a Liberal Revolution and who was looking beyond the United States, even among the Europeans countries, to build the Canal through Nicaragua, because that has been a strategic point in which the Powers have contended, seeking to seize Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">President Taft was the President of the United States and in the face of that Yankee invasion where President Zelaya was told that they gave him so many hours to leave Nicaragua, to leave the Presidency and that they were already going to Nicaragua, they were already coming to Nicaragua, to the Caribbean Coast and then to Corinto where the Yankee troops would disembark. And Zelaya withdrew, that is, he did not have the courage to face the invaders.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">But another Leader of the Liberal Revolution, the Doctor and General Benjamín Zeledón took the lead, look at what courage, what dignity! The Chief of the Revolution, who was Zelaya, left and Zeledón assumed leadership to face the invaders, and he faced them, he fought them, and no matter how much they offered him to surrender, he replied that he would never surrender, that it was a matter of Honor for the Motherland, for the Sovereignty of Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">On 4<sup>th</sup> October, 1912, Zeledón was on celebrating his birthday and that day, he fell in combat in front of the invaders who ordered his death, he was wounded and then the Yankees ordered him to be executed, because the countrymen were also there along with the Yankees, and they assassinated this National Hero, General Benjamín Zeledón, who is the one who passes the flame of the struggle, of Pride and National Dignity, to General Sandino.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Sandino was a child then, just a boy, and he saw the body of General Benjamín Zeledón, when they were parading through the town in a cart so that it would scare the Nicaraguans and that no one else would dare to challenge the Yankee imperialists. And when Sandino witnesses this, he goes so far as to say that General Benjamin Zeledón is really the Father of National Sovereignty, and Sandino commits himself to the struggle then and there.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Then, when the Yankee troops come again in 1926, imagine, Yankee troops continually entering Nicaragua... Who invited them? The local traitors. Of course, there were like the ones that are in prison right now, who invited the Yankee troops, it was the traitors, like those who are detained, they wanted the Yankees to invade Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And that's when General Sandino got up and said: I will never sell myself or give up! Because I want a Free Motherland or Die. This is what our General Sandino said, and he began to fight in the mountains with groups of Peasants and Workers, and there it was organized, what Gabriela Mistral, that extraordinary Intellectual, Chilean Poet, called in a poem dedicated to Sandino, the “Little Crazy Army”; crazy with Heroism, crazy with consciousness, crazy with Dignity, yes, our General Sandino.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And they used the Air Force, yes, the Air Force was used against the Army for the Defense of National Sovereignty. The first times in which the Yankees used its Air Force in the world was here in Nicaragua, how incredible! Amazing! Yes, their fighter jets, the Yankees fighter jets, DH4 USMC, they brought them to bomb General Sandino.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">It was then Calvin Coolidge, another President that came to power, whether Democrat or Republican. He came to try to oppress Nicaragua, but he was always met with resistance, with heroism, with the combativeness of the Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">In the end, they could not defeat Sandino and they admitted it, in their history of war they admit that they could not defeat Sandino, and rather it was a war that wore them down, wore them down in the face of the international public opinion and wore them down before The American People, just as the war in Vietnam wore them down, that war here in Nicaragua wore them down.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Then, not being able to defeat him, not being able to kill him, to assassinate him, they had no choice but to withdraw; In other words, our General Sandino could not be defeated by the Yankee troops in the field, in combat. After the Yankee troops left, a Peace Process came and in the Peace Process the Yankees conspired and used Somoza to assassinate Sandino.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And the Yankees deciding over territories here. It was also in that period that the Government of Calvin Coolidge came and made Treaties to give up San Andrés, which was part of Nicaragua and we felt it as part of Nicaragua, respecting the Court's ruling, we felt it as part of Nicaragua, since San Andrés is totally linked to the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua; Nicaraguan Sisters Brothers who were born in San Andrés, Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers who have Family in San Andrés, Afro-descendants, who are there in Bluefields, in the Bluff and in all that Caribbean area.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And there he came and on March 24, 1928 they decided in Treaties, to ensure greater dominance and greater influence in the Region, to deliver San Andrés to Colombia. In other words, they also came deciding, distributing as Kings distributing lands, in the time of the Spaniards here, mind you, the Kings distributed what did not belong to them.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">What can you call someone who acts in this manner? Can you call him a "thief"? No, we cannot call him a thief because he is not stealing a wallet. Can you call him a thief, and a scoundrel? Yes, thieves, scoundrels, criminals, murderers, because they stole the lands and murdered our Indigenous Ancestors. And the Priest were there, standing behind them and blessing the crimes, a complicity of the Priests. Not all of them. Like everything in Life there were exceptions, like Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, who was the exception.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Then comes that period in which, I do not know in how many Latin American countries this has happened, but here in Nicaragua, while Sandino was in the struggle, the Yankees organized elections at the request of the traitors. So the delighted gringos who had troops here, fighting against Sandino, they were the Supreme Electoral Council, a gringo General; Members of the Supreme Electoral Council, gringo colonels; Presidents of the Departmental Electoral Councils, Colonels and Gringo Captains; Members of the Election Councils and Prosecutors, Gringo Officials. What a shame! What a shame! What a shame!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">What a shame! To themselves, what a shame! They should be ashamed. The current President of the United States should be ashamed. They should ask for forgiveness for the crimes they have committed in Nicaragua, in Latin America and in the world... They should ask for forgiveness!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Look, they organized the Elections, they gave the results, and the "wimps", the countrymen, accepted the results. Look, that is what they wanted now for these elections, they wanted to be at the head of the Supreme Electoral Council, a gringo General or a gringo Colonel, gringo military at the head of the Electoral Councils counting the votes, and the Nicaraguans there. No! That will not happen again in Nicaragua, never again! Never more! Never again! Never again!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And then the story of the “wimp” that was left in charge of the country, of Somoza, during more than 40 years, a great friend of President Roosevelt, consider that, and President Roosevelt when they asked him, why, President, do you support Somoza? He was asking some decent American. Ah, he said, because Somoza is a son of a bitch, but he is our son of a bitch.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">In other words, those who are imprisoned there are the "sons of bitches" of the Yankee imperialists. They should be taken there, to the United States because those are not Nicaraguans anymore, they stopped being Nicaraguans a long time ago, they have no country. Let them take them there, so that there they can serve as what they are, slaves of the Empire, traitors of the Motherland.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">I remember, when we won the elections in November 2006, before three elections had passed, an election in which they got together, who put them together? The Yankees put them together. And threatening, that if the People voted for the FSLN the war would continue, then many people out of fear voted in favor of the Yankees. The President of the United States himself said it at the time, President George Bush Sr., said it calmly, who was his candidate, the lady who presided over the UNO; In other words, she was a candidate of the Yankee Government, she was not a candidate of the Nicaraguan People, she was the candidate of the Yankee Government, and also of the Europeans.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Well, that Choice was not a Free Choice, why? Because it was under threat that the People were going to vote, and not everyone had the commitment to vote as their Heart told them, because already so much pain, so many deaths, so much blood had flowed, more than 50,000 deaths, because of the war imposed by President Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That war was imposed by President Ronald Reagan and was imposed and defended openly. With what law? With what law? With what law? And violating internal Laws of the Congress itself. Reagan maintained the war by negotiating with drug traffickers, Reagan maintained a war that caused more than 50,000 victims in our Country, a brutal war, and they wanted to occupy a part of the National Territory.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">How many attempts did they make! Every day there were invasions from the North, invasions from the South, they had camps in the North and they had camps in the South, camps in Honduran territory, camps in Costa Rican territory and the waves of invaders came.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">I remember talking on one occasion with our Brother Comandante Fidel, he told me: We had a Playa Girón and we defeated it. The problem you have, is that you have borders, and every day they are there launching the invasion. Worried and logically giving us all his solidarity in those years of Heroic Resistance of the Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">They wanted to occupy a piece of our territory, they wanted to take Teotecacinte, which is the tip of the territory that enters Honduran territory there; There they surrounded Teotecacinte, they penetrated from the sides, they penetrated from the front, even looking for a way to occupy more territory. And under these conditions the plan was to declare a liberated zone with a Provisional Government and immediately then, the Yankee troops would arrive. That was the plan that Reagan had and that plan kept him during his two terms of government, he maintained that criminal plan.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And the International Court of Justice, because we went to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, condemned the United States for those crimes and told them that they were terrorists and that they should cease their aggressions. But the International Court of Justice was of little use to them.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Then President Obama came to the Presidency, and I repeat it again, the United States was condemned by the International Court of Justice and according to International Law, according to the Laws, he is obliged to compensate Nicaragua, instead of attacking Nicaragua, they should compensate Nicaragua for all the damages caused against our Country in those years, only during those years, because we are not talking about a lawsuit that covers the entire long history of aggressions and crimes of the United States against Nicaragua, we are simply talking about a period.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US">If anyone should be in the International Criminal Court, it is the North American State, it is the North American Governors who have been putting these crimes into practice, period after period, against the Peoples of the World.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Then the other President, Trump, arrived, because Obama listened to me there in Trinidad and Tobago, where I made him see that they owed Nicaragua, that they should compensate Nicaragua; but no, instead what he did was to find a way to withdraw some Programs that had been managed here by people like the ones who are currently locked up for their anti-patriotic attitude and peddling.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">President Trump had already declared us as a State that threatens the Security of the United States, he had already done so with the Sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Land of Bolívar, the Land of Chávez, the Land of Nicolás... Greetings Nicolás, we know that we are seeing each other, communicating and fighting together.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Imagine, Nicaragua a threat to the security of the United States, simply to have tools to be harassing, to be applying what they call Sanctions that are nothing more than aggressions.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And President Biden... we had great expectations, because he said that he was going to resume relations with Cuba based on the Agreements that President Obama had taken with Cuba. But since we already know how the North American State works; dominated by those who have a great degree of power in Florida, yes, they have a lot of influence and all those who are behind the large companies, arms dealers, manufacturers of arms, airplanes, bombs.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">So, with Cuba, rather than ending the blockade, it has tightened, it has tightened the sanctions against Cuba. And there, Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers, Latin American and Caribbean Sisters and Brothers, of the World, there we have in Cuba an example of Firmness, Dignity; the Heroism of an entire People, who have resisted, who have won and who will continue to win, the Heroic People of Cuba, the People of Fidel, Raúl, Che, the People of our Brother Miguel Díaz-Canel. Thank you Miguel for your Message, and thank you Raúl too, we have received your Message, Dear Brother Raúl Castro, Historical Leader of the Cuban Revolution, along with Fidel.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">We do not want to be talking here about the Yankees, or the Spaniards, or the Europeans; In any case, it would be good if we talked with them about respectful relationships of all kinds, Commerce, Investment. But no, they only speak with the “stick”, and they continue to consider these countries as the backyard of the United States and they believe they are owners of our Territories.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Dear Sisters and Brothers, Dear Comrades, Dear Nicaraguan Families, tonight where the Electoral Results are already known, we want to greet, on behalf of our Peoples those who have had the Dignity, the Solidarity, the Courage to accompany us in these Elections, Companions who are not servants of the Empire or of the Europeans.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Sisters and Brothers from Abkhazia have come from Europe, here we have the Chancellor of Abkhazia who also accompanied us here on the 19<sup>th</sup> of July... Thank you, Dear Chancellor. Comrades who are here, have come from Germany, Dear Sisters and Brothers. From Belgium; 14 Spanish Sisters and Brothers have come from Spain; from France, from Ireland, from Italy, from South Ossetia; From the Russian Federation we have several comrades; there is the Foreign Minister of Abkhazia, Kove Daur and there is also the Comrade Dimitri Novicov, Congressman before the Parliament of the Russian Federation and Vice-Chairman of the Committee for International Relations of the State Duma.

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Independent journalists, not from the big Corporations that we already know who they belong to, they belong to the Empires, and to the scoundrels that have the audacity to say that they want to come to cover our Elections, if they live cursing us and want to come and cover the Elections. We already know, they are employees of the Intelligence Agencies of the United States of America. They don't fit here.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Then we have Journalist Brothers from Brazil, Chile, China, Cuba, Spain, England, the United Kingdom, Russia, and also a Journalist from Venezuela. How much we thank all of you, this People thanks you for your accompaniment, an Accompaniment of Dignity, we are grateful to you.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And here, presiding over this Act in Tribute to Comandante Carlos, is Comrade Rosario<br />
<br />
Murillo, Vice President of the Republic of Nicaragua, great grandniece of our General Sandino. And I spoke on the phone with Blanca Segovia, she went to vote, you saw her on television, we took her in a wheelchair, but she always had that voice, with that strength... Every time I talk to her I tell her, that through her I feel the Force, the Spirit of our General Sandino, and I feel more strengthened every time I speak with Blanca Segovia. Greetings Blanca, and to all the Family, to all the children, the grandchildren.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Here, accompanying us, presiding are Army General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Commander in Chief of the Nicaraguan Army. The Sisters and Brothers of the Police that have done an extraordinary job, in everything related to the logistical activities to ensure the Elections, even risking their lives, because they have had to move materials, logistics, through rivers, and especially the rivers on the Caribbean, where rivers flow with great force and that have caused many accidents. There the Comrades have exposed their Lives.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Likewise, here with us, is the President of the National Assembly, our Brother Doctor Gustavo Porras; Gustavo is also in charge of the Social Coordinator and President of FETSALUD, ensuring that the enormous health apparatus that we have works, and where we have Doctors, Nurses, Health Personnel with a great Mystique, with a great Vocation.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">To all of them on this day who, facing all the diseases that normally affect the population, have known how to act firmly, with Heroism, with Love for Others, attending to those who are being and have been affected by the virus, by this pandemic that affects the World. Our Recognition to Doctors and Nurses, to Health Sector Workers.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Here we are also accompanied by a Heroine, First Congresswoman Elected to the National Assembly, Amada Pineda. Amada´s partner was murdered in those days of the Somoza tyranny, and the terrorists, armed and financed by the Yankee Empire, murdered her son in April. Amada Pineda, Amada, yes, Amada is a noble woman, full of Love, and with the enormous pain that she carries, she knows how to face and continue to fight for the Motherland, for Sovereignty, for the Dignity of Nicaragua.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">She also accompanies us, and our greetings from here to the widow of Comandante Carlos, and here is her son, Carlos Fonseca Terán. Carlos attends to what is the Department of International Relations of the FSLN. And I remember that Haydée, she always signed with Carlos, his partner. So our greetings to her, to María Haydée, to Tania, to Tania's children and to Carlos's children, to everyone. Here's one of Carlos's children, what is his name Carlos? Umanzor, after Juan Pablo Umanzor.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

There is also the General Commissioner Adolfo Marenco Corea, Deputy Director General of the National Police; the General Commissioner Ramón Avellán Medal; Major General Marvin Elías Corrales Rodríguez, Inspector General of the Army, and Commissioner General Jaime Vanegas Vega, Inspector General of the National Police.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">And we greet General Francisco Díaz, our Greetings to General Francisco Díaz, who is watching us from his house; but he has to rest a little, he has to take care of himself. Yes, you know that these viruses attack everywhere, but that's okay, he even went to vote. But we told him, that he shouldn´t come to the event tonight, because they recommend that he must rest so that he can recover well, and God must allow him to recover well, so that he can come again by accompanying us in these Acts. So our Greetings to General Francisco Díaz.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">This evening, tonight, we insist that our commitment is toward Peace, just as our vote was for Peace, and the Nicaraguan People turned out to vote for Peace, Nicaraguan Families went out of their way to vote for Peace. And what do we say to the Powers that continually threaten us, that threaten the entire World? That this is a Country of Peace, and we have said it, even in the time of Ronald Reagan we said it, we want good relations with the United States. Ah, but for this country, good relations is having someone who does what they say and not what the People decide.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">But we maintain that position of developing relationships of Respect, relationships that seem like a utopia; to ask Empires to establish relationships of Respect, but we are obliged to try, because we know that they have Peoples that fight for Justice, that fight for Freedom, that Fight for Solidarity, and who have great Love for the Latin American and Caribbean Peoples.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Now, Dear Sisters and Brothers, Dear Nicaraguan Families, we continue working for Peace, working to strengthen Reconciliation, that Reconciliation that we have achieved... How much progress we have made toward Reconciliation. Reconciliation bore fruit, because we maintain Unity, Cohesion among Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers that are not Sandinistas, they are from other parties, they were even from the Nicaraguan Resistance, but who are now a part of the Alliance "United Nicaragua Triumphs", they are part of the Unity, because they have put our Motherland, our Sovereignty, first, in order to continue working in all fields, to continue working so that we can eradicate poverty and achieve greater and better development, and a more dignified life for all Nicaraguan families.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Long live the 45th Anniversary of the Transit toward Immortality of Comandante Carlos Fonseca Amador!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Sandino Live, the Fight Continues!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Long live Nicaragua, Blessed and Always Free!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Sovereignty is neither sold, nor surrendered!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Sovereignty is neither sold, nor surrendered!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">A Free Nation or Death!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<h3><em><strong>Remarks by Rosario Murillo, Vice President of Nicaragua,<br />
at the Commemoration of the 45th Anniversary of the Transit toward Immortality of<br />
Comandante Carlos Fonseca Amador</strong></em></h3>

<h3><em><strong>November 8, 2021</strong></em></h3>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Good evening. Let us congratulate each other...! The People, the People's Force, has won, wins, and will continue to win, because we will continue to win. Because our Cause, as our General said, and says, because here it is within each one of us, is the Cause of Justice, is the Cause of Love.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">This Explosion of Joy and Celebration that we have seen in Nicaragua, from yesterday to today, and every day, because we are a happy People, but now we have great reasons to celebrate that our Elections were carried out as a reaffirmation of the Will, of the Commitment, of the Responsibility that Nicaraguan Families, the Majorities, have with Peace and for Peace, for the Good and with the Good, with the Intense, Infinite Love that unites us and that should unite us.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Because what we want, all of us, is Work and Peace, is Reconciliation, is to go Forward, Everyone Together. This is how We Go Forward, this is how we continue to succeed, this is how we prosper. Well, we are a Fighting People and a People that knows about difficulties, adversities, harsh, difficult circumstances, and horror, but we have Love, Honor and Glory, and that is how we have known how to face all these hard, difficult and painful Times, which we have faced with Honor, with Nobility, with Bravery, with the Fire of the Soul, and above all, we have faced them with Dignity.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">What we see in all of Nicaragua is the ratification of the Great Dignity of our People, which we are All, and the Pride we feel of being Nicaraguan Patriots, not traitors... Nicaraguan Patriots! We walk the Legacy of our National Heroes. Heroic Heritage is what we Nicaraguans have. We are proud to be, by the Grace of God, Nicaraguan Worthy Patriots, who defend and write in large letters the National Sovereignty of Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">We defend our National Sovereignty with Love, with Peace, with Music, with Willingness and Determination for Work and Peace. We defend our National Sovereignty and we say, it has been written in large letters throughout history. For a long time it was written with blood, now we want to write, Sovereignty: Work and Peace. Sovereignty: Education and Peace. Sovereignty: Family, Home and Community Values, Work and Peace, because Work, from Sovereignty and National Dignity, is Integrity and is Prosperity.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">We are United in Victories, we are All Together, United to Prosper, to Progress. And above all, we are a United People that safeguards Mutual Understanding, Harmony, Tranquility and Peace as Treasure. They wanted to take away our peace, but <b>They Could Not, Nor Could They!</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Our People have the unwavering and in-bribable Conviction to Peace, to Tranquility, and above all, to look at each other as a Family, to Love Our Neighbor, to be genuinely Christians that live in Fraternity, a Brotherhood of Human Beings who believe in Jesus Christ. Every day we creates a Motherland that is more attached to that Faith, to that Trust in the Values <font face="Cambria Math, serif">​​</font>of Jesus Christ, because we know that without Faith, without that Trust in the Father, we are nothing.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">We walk and transcend all circumstances because we have Faith, and because we know how to live as Families, filled with Faith, filled with Love, and with the commitment to continue creating that Bright Future, which we all want and that we all deserve.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Puppetry and puppets have nothing to do here... We must be aware that it is not with darkness that the day is reached, it is not with hatred that the day is built, it is not by selling our Country that we can made the Motherland.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">We must be aware that it is by a <b>Sun and under a Sun that does not decline</b>, enlightened and inspired by the Heavenly Father, united in our Traditional Family Values, such as Homes, Unity of Everyone, and Together we say, Let's Go Forward!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom:0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">An embrace to all the Nicaraguan Families who are living these Historic Days with Joy. We ratify and reconfirm that we are, and will continue to be, the People President. Here the People has the Power and a Government that lives in a Project and with a Program to Fight Poverty. Because we want to leave behind that Poverty that they have imposed on us, with which they have tried to dominate us... Leave it behind! Fight against Poverty and Prosperity for All. All Families working, studying and prospering.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0cm">Thank you, thank you, we say thank you to all Nicaraguans who embrace each other in New Times, in New Days, in a Culture of Peace and Good. Above all, we embrace each other, aware of our Valuable, Courageous Brotherhood, and that Brotherhood is the one that leads us to the Future we want. Thank you, Comrades. Thanks.</p>
