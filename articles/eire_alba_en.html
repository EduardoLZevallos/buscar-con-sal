Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen is under pressure from the country's
political opposition to bring forward a general election scheduled for
March 11th. The urgency stems from a worsening collapse in confidence
in Prime Minister Cowen following the economic rescue package agreed
between the Irish government, the International Monetary Fund and the
European Union in November 2010. Critics of the package argue that its
terms will worsen the Irish government's financial position requiring
further intervention later in 2011 or 2012. Even so it seems the
opposition parties in Ireland will facilitate a vote approving the
package.<br>
      <br>
Ireland's current position<br>
      <br>
Ireland joined what was then the European Economic Community - now,
much expanded, the European Union - in 1973.&nbsp; Since then its
foreign policy has been increasingly more aligned with the main powers
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The fervently
anti-democratic pro-NATO European corporate elites have consolidated
their control of the European Union. As they have done so, Ireland's
people have become proportionately more vulnerable to shocks resulting
from policies implemented for and managed by those elites.<br>
      <br>
In 2010 the government applied a structural adjustment of &#8364;4bn in order
to help bail out Irish banks it had recklessly guaranteed in September
2008. Now, in 2011, under the terms of the EU-IMF "rescue", the Irish
government will immediately apply a structural adjustment of &#8364;6bn
growing to &#8364;11bn by 2014. Ireland's Economic and Social Research
Institute reckons that the government's current commitment to support
Irish (ie. foreign) banks is 61% of GDP of around &#8364;170bn (of which
about 20% is repatriated by foreign companies). Official unemployment
is already around 14%.<br>
      <br>
Ireland's financial relationships are virtually identical to its
foreign policy loyalties : the Western Bloc countries of North America,
Europe and their Pacific allies. The Bank of International Settlements
quarterly review for September 2010 has a table of&nbsp; Ireland's
foreign bank creditors' exposure in the first quarter of 2010 as
follows :<br>

Especially since the fall of the Soviet Union, Irish governments have
committed to a Faustian pact trading their people's sovereign interests
for corrupt financial bubble prosperity and anti-humanitarian NATO war
mongering. A direct relationship exists between Ireland's cynical
collusion in CIA torture rendition flights or US military use of
Shannon airport and the current crisis of the Irish economy. Both
betray deep failures of moral judgment in the face of neocolonial
extortion. <br>
      <br>
Some context <br>
      <br>
Successive referendum votes on European Union treaties have shown that
people in Ireland tend to mistrust the choices made for them by their
ruling class. It is easy to forget that many influential Irish people
have followed in the footsteps of politically powerful individuals like
Peter Sutherland, former head of BP, and Tony O Reilly, former head of
Heinz. The resulting elite network of business relationships and
personal friendships has locked official Irish policy making into the
continuing relative decline of the Western Bloc countries in relation
to emerging competitors.<br>
      <br>
The Western Bloc's financial elite and their political proxies are
determined to protect a corrupt banking sector that made reckless loans
despite Ireland's enormous housing and credit bubble, clearly apparent
since at least 2004. To do so they have imposed a savage structural
adjustment package on people in Ireland despite the fact that the
underlying economy is viable and successful. The terms of that package
imply prolonged austerity by driving down living standards and
diminishing the Irish government's revenue.<br>
      <br>
Over many years, the US authorities dismantled their financial system's
regulatory structure. From 2001 onwards they kept interest rates too
low for too long, allowed ratings agencies to issue corrupt valuations
of securities and permitted favoured investment banks unprecedented
ratios of loans against capital of up to 40 to 1. Among other factors,
all this created intense pressure on the European authorities to act in
concert with their colleagues in the US and Japan to maintain their
Western Bloc financial system in equilibrium by coordinating action on
interest rates and currency rates. <br>
      <br>
This meant that real interest rates in Ireland, where inflation was
higher, were negative. So only a determined effort by regulators would
have been able to control the&nbsp; resulting credit and housing
bubble. But regulators in Ireland followed the example of their US
counterparts. They tolerated predatory lending and corrupt accounting,
leading to the debacle of companies like Anglo Irish Bank whose very
existence depended on the country's massive credit and housing bubble.
Now, because their ruling classes are too craven and cynical to defend
them, ordinary people in Ireland will pay the losses incurred by greedy
foreign banks.<br>
      <br>
Following its own crisis between 1999 and 2002, Argentina faced the
same situation that Ireland does now. Economically, Ireland still has
time to follow Argentina's example. But it should go much further and
recognize that its people will never enjoy sustainable prosperity if
the Irish State does not broaden its autonomous foreign relations as a
matter of urgency.&nbsp; Such moves do not require leaving the European
Union. Taking them might help break the anti-democratic choke hold of
European elites on European Union policy.<br>
      <br>
The relevance of ALBA<br>
      <br>
A crucial component of Argentina's post-crisis economic strategy was
unstinting support from Venezuela, which bought large quantities of
Argentinian government bonds at crucial points in the development of
Argentina's recovery. That gave Argentina's then President, Nestor
Kirchner, vital options and autonomy he would otherwise not have had.
For fundamental economic reasons, any new Irish government after March
11th should take stock and look hard at who its friends really are.
Irish foreign policy has been stultified for years revolving around a
Brussels-Washington axis. <br>
      <br>
The strength of that gravitation will weaken as corporate consumer
capitalism fails to sustain basic standards of living for large numbers
of people and inequality becomes structural. In Latin America a strong
continental consensus agrees that reducing inequality is essential to
reduce poverty. The symmetry is striking between that consensus and the
determination of the European governments to betray the European
Union's original alleged rationale. They are imposing structural
adjustment on their peoples while cosseting the financial elite that
caused the economic crisis to start with.<br>
      <br>
As European governments reduce their peoples' living standards and
increase inequality, the countries of ALBA (the Bolivarian Alliance of
the Americas) are doing the very opposite. ALBA is composed of medium
and small economies, like Ireland's. The ALBA countries are only
beginning to emerge from conditions of neocolonial subjugation that
suppressed their true economic potential. What they have done is
combine to defend their peoples' interests against the local
oligarchies that struck alliances with the dominant powers of North
America and Europe.&nbsp; Ireland's oligarchs have done exactly the
same as their Latin American counterparts and hoodwinked people in
Ireland to integrate ever more deeply into a European Union dominated
by its pro-NATO elite.<br>
      <br>
Ireland should ally with ALBA<br>
      <br>
One of Ireland's key economic problems is its dependence on imported
oil. In 2008 the country imported 191,000 barrels a day, almost 70
million barrels for the year. A preferential deal with Venezuela
similar to those under the ALBA-related Petrocaribe programme would
enable Ireland to pay half the price of any imported Venezuelan oil
within 90 days and the rest over 20 years at 2% interest.&nbsp; On
those terms even 10 million barrels of Venezuelan oil at US$90 per
barrel would free up annually around US$450 million to assist Ireland's
public sector cash flow.<br>
      <br>
As part of ALBA's global strategy, Venezuela has made bilateral deals
with countries as diverse as Portugal, Syria and Belarus. Venezuela's
State oil company PDVSA constantly makes deals with&nbsp; foreign
counterparts and multinational companies. There is no rational reason
for Ireland not to explore a relationship with the ALBA bloc. On the
other hand, political, economic, commercial, technological and cultural
incentives to do so abound.<br>
      <br>
Politically, reaching out beyond the corporate capitalist European
project would break Ireland's spiral into abject neocolonial dependence
on the Western Bloc powers and open up a wider sustainable alternative
to failed corporate capitalism. Economically, especially with regard to
energy and food policy, ALBA's emphasis on solidarity and&nbsp;
complementarity offer numerous advantages to Ireland. In return,
Ireland's technological and cultural industries have much to offer
ALBA. <br>
      <br>
Likewise, there is no reason why the ALBA countries and companies like
PDVSA should not use Ireland - with its 12.5% corporation tax - as
their launch pad into Europe the same way as the United States has
done. For the ALBA countries too, diversification of trade and
financial relationships will be an important source of potential
growth. But the symbolic importance of a formal relationship between
Ireland and ALBA goes well beyond economics and trade.<br>
      <br>
The twin threats of global militarization and environmental change
require much closer collaboration between smaller vulnerable countries
to defend their interests against economic powers like the United
States and the European Union who have shown they are willing to use
their military power ruthlessly anywhere in the world. Ireland's
experience demonstrates that the European Union will instinctively
protect its corporate elites above all else. To protect the fundamental
interests of their peoples, countries like Ireland need urgently to
combine with&nbsp;&nbsp; emancipatory political and economic projects
like ALBA. <br>
