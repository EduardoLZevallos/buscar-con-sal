<br>
On October 14th, the Guardian
published a fine example of disingenuous slitheriness and downright
mendacity with Rory Carroll's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/14/humanrights-voluntarysector">disinformation
gem</a> in defence of fellow Guardian writer <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/giocondabelli">Gioconda
Belli's</a> dissident Sandinista colleagues in Nicaragua. The
Guardian report follows the formula pioneered in the last century by
propaganda guru Edward Bernays. To understand the degree of
disinformation involved in Carroll's report requires a digression
looking briefly at how foreign intervention in Latin America has
coopted development cooperation via non-governmental organizations.<br>
<br>
Bernays helped John Foster Dulles
structure the 1954 coup against the reformist government of Jacobo
Arbenz in Guatemala. A new ingredient in Bernays' old recipe now for
Dulles' ideological grandchildren, like Condoleezza Rice, John
Negroponte and their European counterparts, is the collaborative role
played by some NGOs. Earlier this month the Nicaraguan government
finally lost patience with non-profit NGOs who use donated income
from overseas to fund vicious anti-government political activities
and campaigns. It ordered an investigation into NGOs thought to be
flouting the law.<br>
<br>
In response to the government investigation,
the small right-wing aligned Movimiento Renovador Sandinista (MRS)
party has mobilized international liberal opinion via its influential
media buddy-network. Their campaign fits well into the disinformation
war waged incessantly by international corporate media to discredit
and demonize the ALBA governments of Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and
Venezuela. Like the governments of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala or
Salvador Allende in Chile, the ALBA country governments are
determined to break with traditional patterns of neo-colonial
subjugation.<br>
<br>
To do so they have combined into the Bolivarian
Alternative for the Americas - ALBA. ALBA is a solidarity based trade
and cooperation initiative currently helping almost every country in
Central America and the Caribbean with vital energy and food security
agreements. That is why the ALBA member country governments are
constantly attacked in the corporate media of the Western Bloc
imperialist powers. <br>
<br>
The motifs exploited and distorted in
these media disinformation bulletins are always the same : human
rights and freedom of expression concerns, economic competence and
stability, corruption, regional security issues, terror and
narcotics. The NGO motif has come to prominence now because the
United States government and allied governments are using NGOs for
political ends as part of their low intensity war against the ALBA
countries. It is impossible to understand the current controversy in
Nicaragua without looking at the economic significance of non-profit
NGOs there.<br>
<br>
NGOs in the Nicaraguan economy<br>
<br>
The
Nicaraguan Central Bank reckons that international NGOs donated
around US$267m to Nicaragua in 2007 with trend growth at about 12% a
year. But that is a figure derived from the development cooperation
office of the Foreign Ministry. It almost certainly underestimates
the total cash and in-kind donations actually transferred from
individuals and smaller foreign donors that are not fully reported.
It also only includes registered non-profit non-governmental
organizations that do in fact report fully to the Foreign Ministry. A
small minority most likely do not at all. A conservative guess would
put the foreign ministry's underestimate at between 15% - 20%<br>
<br>
So
one can very probably take as a more realistic, but still quite
conservative, current figure for the 4,200 non-profit NGOs registered
with the government in Nicaragua an average of US$75,000 cash income
per year each. This would add up to US$315m for the current year.
That amount looks impressive at first glance, a significant sum for a
developing country. Billions of dollars of aid have been paid into
Central American economies over the last three decades. But they have
done little to reduce poverty. Here's why.<br>
<br>
Even on
conservative estimates taking that US$315m per annum figure for
Nicaragua as a benchmark, the superficially impressive sum soon
dissipates. Even at a modest average of US$40,000 per year per NGO
in salaries, the total would add up to around US$168m for about
30,000 people. A similarly modest average of US$15,500 per year per
NGO for operating costs, maintenance and vehicles adds up to a bit more than US$65m. That gives a total of about US$233m. <br>
<br>
So of
the original US$315m only about US$82m will remain for capital
investment, non-productive project work (education, training, health
care and social work) and productive projects in agriculture and
small and medium sized businesses. Even if half that US$82m was made
available for productive activity. It is almost insignificant in
terms of overall national economic development. Just one major
disaster - Hurricane Mitch in 1998 &#8211; cost Nicaragua over
US$3bn.<br>
<br>
The same applies to so much of the over-hyped
development cooperation game. International development cooperation
to developing countries is a fraction of those countries' repayments
of external debt and other outflows to rich country economies. Development cooperation
just about helps them sustain their extremely vulnerable economies,
wrecked by decades of unfair terms of trade, structural adjustment
and foreign debt. Under the current &#8220;free market&#8221; system,
countries in Central America are barely able to meet their peoples'
basic needs. <br>
<br>
That is why ALBA is so important. It changes
exponentially the possibilities of economic development for
impoverished countries in Latin America. That is why Western Bloc
elites and their local allies in Latin America detest the ALBA
country leaders.<br>
<br>
NGOs in Nicaraguan politics<br>
<br>
But
whereas non-profit NGOs contribute little beyond subsistence support
to meet peoples' basic needs, the story is very different from the
perspective of a small but well-connected political party like
Nicaragua's MRS. The MRS has a little over 5% electoral support in
Nicaragua. It's popular base is insufficient to help it mobilize
effectively. The MRS punches well above its weight in national
politics because its leaders include the owners of national media and
because the party is supported by local NGOs.<br>
<br>
The 4200
non-profit NGOs registered in Nicaragua with the Ministry of
Governance represent about one NGO for every 1300 people in the
country. Sympathetic NGOs are able to assist the MRS party with use
of office facilities, providing MRS activists with a salary, helping
with stationery and printing costs and with transport. Using that
US$315m benchmark figure, if just 0.5% of non-profit NGO resources
were used to help the MRS, that would still add up to over US$1.5m. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">That is a significant
sum of money for
political purposes anywhere in the world. It is a relatively huge sum
in an impoverished country like Nicaragua. There, as elsewhere in
Latin America, the US government and its allies are using NGOs to
undermine governments in Latin American in countries where local US
allies in the political parties have failed. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The Guardian report<br>
<br>
That is
why the Nicaraguan government is investigating non-profit NGOs. It is
also why the Guardian completely excludes such vital context from its
spurious coverage of the issue. The Guardian report starts</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Oxfam
targeted as Nicaragua attacks 'trojan horse' NGOs.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8226; Sandinista
crackdown to 'clean up' political funding <br>
&#8226; Fears grow for
freedom of speech and European aid."<br>
</div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The headline hints at
the underlying
issue of non-profits getting involved in politics and immediately
sends it to oblivion with scare quotes. The headline and its
accompanying bullet points touch on the traditional propaganda
components. Freedom of expression is there and the economic stability
motif is also exploited by suggesting a threat to "aid".
Note the emotive use of "targeted" and "crackdown"
and more scare quotes around another of the government's reasons for
the investigation.<br>
<br>
The first sentence in the body of the
article sets the tone with dishonest hyperbolic assertion, "The
Sandinista government has launched a sweeping crackdown on
non-governmental organizations". A recent review found that 700
of Nicaragua's 4,200 non-profit organizations were not in full
compliance with the relevant law. Of those organizations only around
a dozen have been requested to clarify their conduct and status. For
the Guardian, that constitutes a "sweeping crackdown".<br>
<br>
The
"sweeping crackdown" against this tiny number of
organizations is supposed to prompt "concerns about freedom of
speech and democratic rights". But those concerns spring most
obviously from the MRS political party whose base lies precisely in
the NGO movement. The NGO sector in Nicaragua depends overwhelmingly
on foreign funding. No country in the world permits non-profits to
support political parties with foreign donations.<br>
<br>
OXFAM
UK<br>
<br>
Carroll strikes a note of implied incredulity by saying
that this "sweeping crackdown" is on NGOs "including
OXFAM". The implied question is "who in their right minds
would target dear old harmless granma OXFAM ?" Anyone familiar
with the development game as played by the major Western Bloc
development NGOs knows very well they all, both at home and abroad,
tread a questionable line in their "advocacy" between
education and information work and active intervention. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">One can very
plausibly argue that these
wealthy Western Bloc NGOs constitute the soft, extra-mural arm of
NATO country foreign policy. The term NGO is in fact largely a
misnomer. They receive much, if not most, of their funding either
from government development cooperation departments or from the
development cooperation budget lines of the European Commission.
<br>
<br>
The one solid attributable quote from a participant in the
Nicaraguan controversy in Carroll's whole report is from Oxfam's
chief executive. She is reported as saying that OXFAM works in a
"transparent, accountable and non-partisan way." Her glib,
unconvincing assertion bears little reality to the practice of any of
the main Western Bloc NGOs working in Latin America. <br>
<br>
OXFAM is
not accountable to people at grass roots in any meaningful way. It is
only notionally accountable to its donor base in the UK. Its
bureaucrats cut deals behind closed doors around the world,
particularly in Brussels with the European Commission. The same is
true of the rest of the somewhat incestuous Western European
development agency mafia. <br>
<br>
In Nicaragua, almost all the main
foreign NGO representatives clearly favour the social democrat New
Labour-wannabes in the MRS over NGOs sympathetic to the governing
Sandinista FSLN party. For example, the pro-FSLN AMNLAE national
women's organization has always been marginalized by foreign NGOs. So
it is hardly surprising when Carroll notes, "Privately,
officials from several other aid agencies questioned whether they
could work in the western hemisphere's second-poorest country after
Haiti.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Inconvenient detail<br>
<br>
Carroll's
short article is dense with falsehoods, distortion and innuendo. The
second sentence runs "Police raided the offices of two pressure
groups..." What Carroll does not report is that the police
searches, far from being unexpected "raids", were follow up
measures resulting from a refusal of the organizations concerned to
cooperate with an official investigation. <br>
<br>
The investigation
resulted from a request by the Ministry of Governance asking the
Public Prosecutor's office to investigate apparent non-compliance by
those organizations. Both the organizations concerned, the Centro de
Investigaciones para Comunicación (CINCO) and the Movimiento
Autonomo de Mujeres (MAM), were twice requested to visit the public
prosecutor's offices to assist the authorities with their enquiries.
They refused to do so. <br>
<br>
CINCO is a non-profit registered with
the Ministry of Governance. It is not supposed to be a political
"pressure group".The director of
CINCO is the widely respected but controversial journalist Carlos
Fernando Chamorro, who is a high profile supporter of the MRS. MAM,
part of the opposition MRS political alliance, is a recognized
pressure group focusing on women's rights.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The director of MAM is
Sofia Montenegro a pugnacious, uncompromising activist, who is also on
the board of CINCO. Most of this essential information is missing
from the Guardian report. The MRS opposition alliance is not even
mentioned, let alone its connections with MAM and CINCO.<br>
<br>
This
is the context in which other organizations involved in the
investigation, like OXFAM, are being asked to assist the authorities
in clarifying whether or not non-profits have been funding the
opposition MRS campaign. Part of that campaign involves propaganda
suggesting that Daniel Ortega should be assassinated. That propaganda
has been condemned by non-partisan solidarity organizations,
including the umbrella US solidarity group, Nicanet. So the matter is
far from trivial.<br>
<br>
Unsourced falsehood<br>
<br>
The
Guardian also reports the extraordinary falsehood that "Several
European governments are preparing to axe tens of millions of dollars
in aid in protest, a sign of how much international support Ortega
has lost since his return to power last year." No foreign
government has made any such announcement. Although it is common
knowledge that throughout Latin America, European governments are
reviewing their aid programmes because their countries' "aid"
lobbies tend to believe their countries' focus should be in
Africa.<br>
<br>
Sweden has already ended its development cooperation
programme with Nicaragua because it has changed its policy focus to
Africa. On the other hand, Germany recently confirmed its continuing
programme in Nicaragua following sensationalist anti-Sandinista
reports in the right wing German press. The IMF recently met
Nicaraguan government officials in Washington to agree continuing
cooperation. Where could Carroll's mendacious innuendo have
originated?<br>
<br>
The only support Carroll offers for his baseless
assertion is an anonymous quote from "one diplomat in Managua".
Here Carroll borrows from fellow anti-ALBA ideologue John Carlin, who
has used anonymous "high-level security, intelligence and
diplomatic sources" to <a href="http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/3122">smear
the Venezuelan government</a>. Now Carroll wheels out this
decrepit,
hydra-headed, Cold War-era veteran, unable to walk on its own,
reeking dreadfully of MI6 and CIA leaks, to try and smear Nicaragua's
Sandinista government. It is certainly possible that some foreign
governments may time an announcement cutting aid in an effort to influence
voting against the governing FSLN party in the forthcoming municipal
elections. So far, though, no foreign government representative has
said anything publicly in Nicaragua. <br>
<br>
Serving MRS electoral
propaganda<br>
<br>
But Carroll's report still does not explain that
CINCO seems to have received money from foreign donors via OXFAM and
other organizations, that it then passed on to MAM, a member of
Nicaragua's political opposition. Carroll falsely misrepresents the
official investigation, suggesting that OXFAM had to "pre-empt"
a "raid". The normal procedure in such investigations is for&nbsp;the public
investigator's office to
request the party concerned&nbsp;go for an interview to&nbsp;, which is what OXFAM did.<br>
<br>
Carroll's
report in the Guardian completely misses the fundamental issues
involved in the official investigation into non-profit NGOs. He seems
not to be aware of or to understand the relevant Nicaraguan
legislation or the way NGOs are supposed to manage their accounts or
the difference between a non-profit in Nicaragua and what he calls
"pressure groups". Perhaps the most glaring omission is any
mention of the opposition MRS party and MAM's relation to it -
something without which the affair becomes completely unfathomable
and much easier to manipulate dishonestly as a clear cut, freedom of
expression issue.<br>
<br>
Current opinion polls suggest the FSLN
government in Nicaragua is likely to increase its support at
municipal level in local government elections, to be held on November
9th this year. The political opposition are scraping the very bottom
of their dirty tricks barrel to try and mitigate the looming
electoral defeat. In that context, the Guardian's report fits neatly
into the MRS propaganda tool kit. A debt of thanks is owed to Rory
Carroll for making so very explicit the Guardian's deceitful
propaganda agenda. A tin <a href="http://www.nodo50.org/ceprid/spip.php?article202&amp;lang=en">Foggy
Bottom Cuckoo</a> will be left to rust in his honour, in
appropriate
obscurity, somewhere in Nicaragua.<a href="index.html"><br>
