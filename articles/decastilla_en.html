New Education : a giant and inspiring task<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Interview
with Miguel de Castilla, Minister of Education</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">By Karla Jacobs, </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 24</span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">At the end of November Tortilla
con Sal had the opportunity to talk with the Education Minister, Miguel
de Castilla Urbina, about the work he and his team have been carrying
out over the last 22 months. De Castilla is a sociologist, educator and
education administrator with vast experience in all three fields. He
has
published over 500 articles and dozens of books about the problems,
achievements and challenges of education in Nicaragua and the region.
He was vice minister of Education during the first sandinista
government of the 1980s. <br>
      <br>
In this interview he talks about how the
public education system had been stripped bare by the previous
governments resulting in the exclusion of around 34% of Nicaraguan
school aged children and adolescents. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">He goes on to talk at length
about the giant and inspiring task the Ministry of Education
has set itself of transforming the public education system so as not
only to provide access to education for all Nicaraguan children,
adolescents and even adults, but also to create a system where
students play the role of protagonists and where Nicaraguan culture and
the national reality are the bases upon which, collectively and
inclusively, the New Nicaraguan Education is built. </span><br>
      <br>
TcS: The three governments that preceded the Government of
Reconciliation and National Unity introduced systematic cuts in the
Education Ministry's Budget. What state did you and your colleagues
find the public education system in when you took office in January
2007?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: The most important aspect of the Nicaraguan
public school system when we took office was that it had been
privatized; pupils paid to attend school. Pupils were charged for the
matriculation, they were charged monthly fees. Parents were given
payment receipts for having their kids in school. Within the schools
everything had to be paid for. All the services the schools provided
were sold to pupils. Of course this meant it was very difficult for
many families
to send their kids to school. <br>
      <br>
We believe that around 100,000 girls and boys would not have
matriculated in 2007 if schools had continued to charge for the
education they provided. Five days before the</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> matriculation for the 2007 school
year </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">began the Ministry
of Education published a ministerial decree eliminating all monetary
charges in Nicaraguan public
schools. Year by year in Nicaragua the number of matriculations grow by
around 40,000. But in 2007 there were 140,000 new matriculations.
100,000 of those new pupils would not have matriculated if we had not
undone the
privatization of our public education. <br>
      <br>
Another mechanism that had been introduced as part of the perverted way
in which the education system used to be run was the method used by the
Ministry of Education to fund schools. The Ministry of Education
sent money directly to the schools. The quantity was calculated
depending on the number of pupils the school had. If, for example, a
school had 100 pupils, then a certain amount of money was sent, if a
school had
500 pupils then that amount was multiplied by five, if a school had
1,000 pupils it was multiplied by ten, etc. <br>
      <br>
The school used this money to pay the teachers, to pay for repairs to
the school building, and to buy everything that was needed in the
school. But the schools were not required to inform the Ministry of
Education about how the money was spent therefore the Ministry had zero
control over the money. The money was sent to the school and after that
nothing was known about it. The Ministry of Education never received
any budgets or expenditure reports about how the money was spent. <br>
      <br>
This system resulted in widespread corruption in the handling of the
money, the most visible example being that school directors would send
false reports about the number of pupils they had matriculated in the
school. They exaggerated the number of matriculations. If a school had
matriculated 100 pupils, for example, then the directors might inform
the Ministry that 200 matriculations had taken place in order to
receive
twice as much money. <br>
      <br>
We carried out an investigation into this phenomenon in March 2007 as a
result of which we discovered that around about 125,000 pupils
registered in the matriculation of 2006 had never existed. They were
phantom pupils, as we call them. There were 125,000 pupils that had
never existed but the schools
had received money for them. That money that the
schools had received generally went into the pockets of the directors,
teachers and other school staff. <br>
      <br>
So, as you can see, the public schools that we inherited in 2007 were
not just privatized schools, they were also corrupt schools. The
Nicaraguan public school system had become a system where money took
first place and corruption was an everyday occurence. And in that
system, in that sort of environment, in that crucible, our children
were being educated. It was an environment in which forces competed to
make greater profit and in which knowledge had been converted into a
product like any other which was bought and sold on the marketplace. <br>
      <br>
Obviously we had to bring an end to all of this before we took over the
Ministry of Education. And because several of us had worked as social
investigators in the field of education we were aware of the situation
within the public system. So as soon as we took over the ministry we
issued a ministerial decree in which all charges were eliminated within
the public school system. After that we began the process of replacing
the model by which schools were funded which, as I have explained,
encouraged corruption. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
TcS: If you could talk a little about the work you and your team have
carried out with the aim of overcoming this corruption within the
public education system, and also if you could talk about the
fundamental principles on which the Ministry of Education's work has
been based over
the last 22 months.<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: Well, that was the first step; eliminating charges
within schools, and then eliminating the mechanism by which schools
were funded and creating another funding mechanism. But what we have
been doing
here in Nicaragua goes beyond simple measures. What we have been doing
is constructing an altogether different concept which we call the
Participative Revolution in Education. This concept includes the
involvement of NGOs, of civil society, of parents, of teachers. During
the last 22 months we have
been in the process of constructing a profound transformation in the
education system in our country that we refer to as the Participative
Revolution in Education. <br>
      <br>
As part of this process we carried out a national consultation project
that involved 17,500 people from across the country, among them
teachers, parents, students, NGOs. We sent the plan for the
consultation in digital format to 153 civil society organizations so
they could contribute to it and give us their feedback about the
proposed
transformation of the national curriculum. Nineteen departmental
teachers'
forums took place and another nineteen departmental parents' forums
took
place where what was discussed were people's ideas what should be
taught in our
schools, and what should be learned in our schools. </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
During 2008, based on those experiences, the new
curriculum has been created.&nbsp;<br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We have transformed
the educational model
in Nicaragua.</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> The new
model for Nicaraguan education is now based on five
fundamental pillars: First of all, the new curriculum which has been
completed and will
come into operation in January 2009: The second pillar are&nbsp; the
Evaluation, Planning and Educative Training Workshops which we refer to
as
TEPCEs. These workshops take place once a month with the aim of
evaluating, planning and contextualizing the curriculum. The TEPCEs
take place in the schools
which have been classified as Base Schools as part of the model of
Educational Nuclei which we have introduced: This is the fourth pillar
- the
Educational Nuclei. </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">An
Educational Nucleus is a determined space within the
national territory where there is a Base School and a number of
Neighbouring Schools.</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
There are 1,423 Educational Nuclei across the country: The fourth
pillar are the classrooms, which we are rebuilding and rehabilitating:
And the fifth pillar are the teachers who give life to all of the
other four components. The teacher is the very heart of the
Sandinista Revolution's Model of Quality in Education. This model has
been created exclusively by Nicaraguans, without imitating models from
other countries and without involving any foreign consultants or
advisers. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So as I was saying,
we have divided the national school system into nuclei. In every
municipality of Nicaragua there is a certain number of Educational
Nuclei. Each month an Evaluation, Planning and
Educational Training Workshop (TEPCE) takes place in each Base School
with the participation of the teachers from all the schools
within that Educational Nucleus. These TEPCEs take place on
the last
Friday of each month with the participation of all 47,000 teachers
within our national education system. During the TEPCE the last month's
educational experience is evaluated and the teaching
for the coming month is planned. The same process is used for
preschool and primary and secondary education. </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
So we are involving the teachers in a process of profound training. We
are also transforming the curriculum of the teacher training colleges. <br>
      <br>
Apart from this we are building schools. We inherited 27,500
schools, but of those schools there were 15,000 classrooms which were
in a state of semi destruction. So we have also been involved in the
task of rebuilding classrooms across the country. <br>
      <br>
All these changes we have been carrying out within the Nicaraguan
school
system over the last 22 months are very significant, very important.
They are changes that actually produce a different quality of
education.
What I mean to say is that the type of education provided 22 months ago
has
nothing to do with the type of education provided in our schools today.
      <br>
      <br>
Parallel to all that we are carrying out the National Literacy
Campaign. Two years ago the illiteracy rate in Nicaragua was 30%. Today
we have reduced that to just 7%. That is the lowest illiteracy rate
ever in Nicaraguan history. In other words, today, in November 2008,
Nicaragua has a lower illiteracy rate than ever before. <br>
      <br>
The last time anything was done to try to reduce illiteracy was during
the Popular Sandinista Revolution when the illiteracy rate was reduced
from 53% to 12.9%. Today after two years of the current literacy
campaign, we have reduced illiteracy to 7% and we hope to have reduced
that further to less than 5% by next July in order to be able to
declare Nicaragua a territory free of illiteracy.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So all these different activities represent multiple battles. We also
carry out a school meals program. In Nicaragua around one million
children receive a school meal consisting of rice, beans, cereal,
tortilla, etc. every day. And in around 1,000 schools across the
country school vegetable gardens are being developed which not only
permit pupils
to learn how to cultivate food but also allow school meals to be
complemented with freshly grown produce. <br>
      <br>
What all of this demonstrates is that the Ministry of Education is
actively promoting
justice and quality within the public education system in numerous
different ways. We struggle to make education in Nicaragua more just by
creating access to public education for the largest number of children
and young people possible. We do this with the school meals program and
by distributing school materials, for example. During 2008 we
distributed around 400,000 rucksacks and 200,000 school uniforms and
pairs of shoes to children and adolescents from severely impoverished
rural families. <br>
      <br>
So it is not just that we do not charge pupils to attend school, but on
top of that we give the poorest pupils uniforms, shoes, books, jotters,
rucksacks and school meals. So Nicaraguan schools today are not just
free, but they actually distribute wealth to the pupils with the aim of
encouraging children to come to school and not to dessert the
classroom. And once the kids are in school we try to give them the best
quality of education possible, with a good curriculum, with well
trained teachers. <br>
      <br>
TcS: While it is true that the government increased the amount of money
designated to the Ministry of Education this year, the institution's
budget still seems very small considering the nation's educational
needs. How do you and your team deal with this problem?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: Yes, effectively, one of the characteristics of
Nicaragua's poverty is the country's small budget. One must remember
that
Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Latin American and
Caribbean region. This means that the country's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) is very small, and its budget is as well. Here in the Ministry of
Education we are assigned just 4.2% of the country's GDP. Considering
the size of the Nicaraguan GDP, though, we would need between 7 and 8%
of the GDP in order to cover all our costs. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
However, we have been lucky enough to receive a good quantity of
foreign
aid from governments and organizations keen to contribute to education
and children's welfare in Nicaragua. For example the Dutch, Danish and
Canadian governments are all important
contributors. The same is true of the US government which collaborates
with the Ministry of Education through its Agency for International
Development (USAID). <br>
      <br>
Additionally organizations like UNICEF, FENAP (the UN population
fund), and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization all contribute to
the Education Ministry's fundamental activities. These governments and
organizations help to subsidize the small budget we have which would
only cover the costs of maintenance of the school buildings, teacher's
salaries and the bureaucratic costs necessary in an institution such as
this one. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
We are designated a very small amount of the Nicaraguan budget, but
with that very small amount
and with the Nicaraguan people's goodwill - especially the teachers'
goodwill because Nicaraguan teachers are not well paid - we are able to
do amazing things and we are able to carry forward this country's
education system.<br>
      <br>
This whole process of educational transformation (what I was talking
about earlier to do with the TEPCEs etc.), in a rich country, a
developed country, it would be a very, very expensive process. In
Nicaragua, however, it is not expensive due to the degree of
volunteerism of our teachers and of the population in general. <br>
      <br>
Another
example is the program "Constructors of the Future" as part of which
young
Nicaraguans work voluntarily building new schools. The Literacy
Campaign is
made possible by thousands of young people who teach voluntarily.
Nicaraguans, and especially young Nicaraguans, have demonstrated great
will and capacity to contribute voluntarily when it comes to education.
So our small
budget is compensated by people's devotion towards key educational
activities in Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
TcS: Considering all of this, would you say that teachers and other
public education system workers can expect a significant pay rise in
the coming years?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: Well, the budget for teachers' salaries is growing.
Each year, in line with the General Education Law, the budget has to
grow. In 2007 the monthly salary for primary school teachers grew by
500 cordobas [US$1 = 19.77 cordobas on Dec. 1st 2008], and for
secondary school teachers the monthly salary grew by 700 cordobas.
These pay rises were repeated in 2008. At the moment similar pay rises
are being negotiated for 2009.<br>
      <br>
We would like to bring in significant pay rises, spectacular pay rises.
But I cannot imagine such rises being introduced unless the Ministry
of Education's budget also experiences a dramatic increase. As long as
it is not possible to increase the budget significantly, and with all
the current complications at an international level with the financial
crisis, etc, I am not optimistic about the possibility of a significant
pay rise for our teachers. <br>
      <br>
TcS: To what extent does the government's relations with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) affect decisions concerning teachers'
salaries?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: Well, our government analyzes and agrees not just
teachers' salaries but all public sector workers' salaries with the
IMF. So if up until now the teachers' annual pay rise has been around
500 cordobas, then I do not think there will be problems [between the
government and the IMF] if in the future similar rises are implemented.
      <br>
      <br>
The salaries of all public sector workers - teachers, police officers,
health workers - are agreed as part of the economic program with the
IMF. So I do not see a possibility of change in this regard.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
TcS: I would like to go back to talk about the reforms that have been
made to the national curriculum. What do the reforms consist of? And
with what educational and social objectives have they been implemented?
      <br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: The reforms are multiple. They form part of an
integral process of change. Here, rather than curriculum reforms, what
has taken place is a transformation of educational content. <br>
      <br>
Much</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> new educational
content emerged </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">during
the Great National Curriculum Consultation&nbsp; which is being
introduced today as part of the new curriculum. For example, economics,
sociology and philosophy had been eliminated from the secondary school
curriculum in Nicaragua. Today those subjects are being reincorporated.
      <br>
      <br>
The secondary school curriculum is being completely transformed to
include a
strong polytechnic emphasis. By doing this we aim to provide students
with more than
just a ticket to get into university. We want to also be able to
provide those students who are unable to go to university with the
option of obtaining skilled work after leaving school. We are not
talking about every day technical education, but about the possibility
for all secondary school pupils to learn a skill, any skill, which will
later serve as a work option. <br>
      <br>
So these are profound transformations in the secondary curriculum which
emerged as part of the Great National Consultation. There are many new
concepts. There are transverse ideas that underly the whole curriculum
like culture of peace, gender equality, defense of the environment,
etc. These are transversal themes that did not used to form part of the
curriculum and now they do. <br>
      <br>
Another change is that the new curriculum is organized monthly. The
educational diet that the pupils of each grade should receive
is planned month by month.&nbsp; This takes place at the monthly
TEPCEs. The new curriculum is organized in line with the Nicaraguan
educational innovation known as the TEPCEs. <br>
      <br>
So there are a series of changes, of particularities, contained within
the new curriculum as a result of this whole process of educational
transformation which has been taking place in Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
And I can assure you that several, if not all, of the transformations
that are taking place within the Nicaraguan education system today are
uniquely Nicaraguan. They have not been copied from a foreign
educational manual or thought up by a foreign consultant. I can assure
you that no consultants financed by international organizations have
participated in this process. This is a process that has been created
by
Nicaraguans. Nicaragua's capacity in the field of education is vast.
Nicaragua's cultural accumulation in the field of education is vast.
And we have made use of this historical accumulation during the
construction of the new model for Nicaraguan education. <br>
      <br>
You will not find an education system divided into nuclei like it is in
Nicaragua in any other part of the world. In other words, the 1,324
Educational Nuclei in Nicaragua constitute an organizational model that
does not appear in any other country. <br>
      <br>
The same goes for the TEPCEs which are our mechanism for planning and
evaluating the curriculum across the country month by month. These
workshops are based on the educational model introduced in Nicaragua
during the first Sandinista government of the 80s. But this planning
model does not exist in any other country.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The Participatory Revolution in Nicaraguan Education consists of
multiple simultaneous reforms which are all articulated between each
other and which all seek the same results which are justice and quality
within the Nicaraguan education system. The concepts of the
Participatory Revolution are Nicaraguan creations. They are concepts
which have been created collectively with the participation of
teachers, students, parents, NGOs specializing in education, etc. There
are ten national education commissions which involve representatives
from universities, social movements and NGOs who cooperate with the
Ministry of Education without charge and who help to develop all the
different aspects of the new education.<br>
      <br>
TcS: Changing the subject, I want to talk about something that took
place a few years ago, during the
government of Engineer Enrique Bolaños, when the Ministry of
Education felt obliged to abandon the new curriculum that had been
prepared about reproductive health and sexuality. It was assumed that
the decision to abandon the new curriculum was the result of pressure
from the Catholic Church Hierarchy. At that time the already
established curriculum, based on the conservative vision of the
Catholic Church, remained active. It was a curriculum that lacked
appropriate information about matters like contraceptives,&nbsp;
sexually transmitted diseases and sexual diversity. </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Anger and disappointment were
expressed at a
national and international level as a result of these events.</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> <br>
I understand that as part of the transformation of the national
curriculum during the last two years reforms have been made to the
contents surrounding these issues. What is the Ministry of Education's
current policy about the teaching of reproductive health and sexuality?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: When we took on the Ministry we were given a manual
on the subject which had been put together as a result of the
controversy that you mention. This manual was drafted by a group of
people, a group of consultants hired by the Ministry of Education after
that controversy. So that manual was given to us and, before we put it
to use, just like we did with the entire curriculum, we consulted it
with 17,500 people. <br>
      <br>
Right now the manual is being taught as part of a pilot project. With
the support of UNICEF we printed 500 copies of the manual so as to use
it in a pilot project with students of the final year of secondary
school. We wanted to hear opinions about the manual from teachers,
parents and students.<br>
      <br>
Obviously our criteria on these issues are not similar to those on
which previous manuals were based. Sexual and reproductive health are
amply
discussed in this new manual, as is the importance of using
contraceptives to prevent AIDS.<br>
      <br>
The subject of AIDS is very, very important for the Ministry of
Education. </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Ministry
of Education is organizing a national event surrounding the issue of
AIDS </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">during the first
week of December in which numerous different colleges and schools will
take part. <br>
      <br>
I personally took part in an international event in the City of Mexico
last July where ministers of health and education from
across Latin America got together to talk about the issue of AIDS and
how to deal with the issue in school curriculae. <br>
      <br>
So we have been attending to these issues. In the direction of school
counselling young people's sexuality is an issue that is covered. Young
people are offered counselling about these matters in our schools and
colleges. <br>
      <br>
Reproductive and sexual health are issues that actively involve us
because we know about the problems of sexually transmitted diseases,
AIDS, teenage pregnancies. So we know that young people need a lot of
sex education in order for our youth to practise their sexuality
responsibly. <br>
      <br>
And with regards to the manual, we have not had any problems. We have
introduced it as part of a pilot program and we expect to start massive
reproduction of the manual in 2009 so that it becomes part of the new
curriculum across the country.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
TcS: In terms of adult education the government has been seen to
prioritize the literacy campaign using the method Yo Sí Puedo
(Yes, I Can). Are other forms of adult education also being prioritized?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: Yes. Coincidentally, Leonela Reyes who created the
Yo, Sí Puedo method is in Nicaragua at the moment. Today Reyes'
method is used across the world - it is used in almost all Latin
American countries and also in countries like Angola. Doctor Reyes is
currently in Nicaragua helping us to translate the Yo, Sí Puedo
workbooks into the languages of the Miskitos and the Mayangnas which
are indigenous populations located in the north Caribbean region of
Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
As well as the Yo Sí, Puedo method there are many other methods.
Most notably the psychosocial method for adult education by Paulo
Freire which was used during the Literacy Crusade in the 1980s. In
Nicaragua there are many methods. <br>

TcS: What options are there for those who finish the literacy course
and want to continue their studies?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: We do not stop after the literacy campaign. We hope
to declare Nicaragua free of illiteracy next July. But after that the
method continues. The follow up method is called Yo, Sí Puedo
Seguir (Yes, I can continue).<br>
      <br>
Our aim is that by 2015 the entire previously illiterate adult
population is not just able to read and write but is also studying
towards their sixth grade of primary school. That is the Nicaraguan
aim. This aim is not similar to the UN Millennium Goal in the field of
Education. Nicaragua's aim goes way beyond the UN's goal. We hope that
by 2015 the entire adult population is studying for their sixth
grade and we also hope to have stamped out the origin of
illiteracy which is a lack of primary education. <br>
      <br>
One of the errors of the neo liberal governments in Nicaragua were the
charges in public schools. The school fees and other charges encouraged
illiteracy in Nicaragua. Charging inside schools resulted in the
exclusion of an enormous number of young people from the school
system. And that exclusion resulted in a high rate of illiteracy in
Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
So we are fighting against illiteracy on two different battlefields. We
are carrying out the National Literacy Campaign "From Martí to
Fidel," but we are also working towards the inclusion of the greatest
number of children possible in primary school education. <br>
      <br>
The way to eliminate illiteracy in a country in not through literacy
campaigns. That is a mechanism which has to be used when the illness is
already installed. The way to eliminate illiteracy is by creating
universal access to primary education. So we are at the front of the
struggle to eliminate illiteracy in Nicaragua with the hope that this
is the last literacy campaign in the country's history. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
TcS: The majority of organizations and institutions dedicated to
development in impoverished countries around the world have concluded
that one of the most effective ways of achieving a state of integrated
development is through education programs for women. Do you agree with
that conclusion?<br>
      <br>
Miguel de Castilla: That is crucial for us. Apart from the National
Literacy Campaign the government promotes programs like Zero Usury and
Zero Hunger, or the Food Production Bond, which exclusively benefit
women. Several of the government's programs benefit women directly. If
there is one sector of society that is given special attention and
treatment as part of the Literacy Campaign it is the female population.
&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
We understand that if we teach a woman to read and write we are doing
more than just resolving the severe problem of her own illiteracy.
Through her we are contributing to the solution of other problems in
Nicaraguan homes. By teaching women to read and write we are nipping
illiteracy in the bud. <br>
      <br>
So the Ministry of Education considers the importance of women's
inclusion </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">within </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">our</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> plans of attention </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">to be crucial</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">. 50% of matriculations in Nicaragua
from preschool to&nbsp; secondary education, and even university,
respond to female students. The proportion of female to male students
is always around about 49% to 51%, or 50.5% to 49.5%. That tendency was
established during the Sandinista Revolution in the 1980s and has been
maintained. And we actively promote the continuation of proportionally
gender balanced matriculations. <br>
      <br>
TcS: My questions end there, Minister. I would like to take advantage
of this opportunity to thank you for meeting with me and also to
congratulate you and your colleagues for the recent announcement by the
Organization of Educational Excellence for the Americas of its plan to
award this year's Acknowledgment of Educational Excellence to the
Nicaraguan Ministry of Education.<br>
