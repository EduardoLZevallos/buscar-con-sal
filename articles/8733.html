<a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/28/us-oas-nicaragua-political-prisoners-murder/https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/28/us-oas-nicaragua-political-prisoners-murder/">https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/28/us-oas-nicaragua-political-prisoners…</a></em></p>

<h3><em><strong>Ben Norton reports from Nicaragua, where the US embassy and OAS successfully lobbied for the release of violent criminals who led a coup attempt in 2018. Some of these so-called “political prisoners” have stabbed their pregnant girlfriends to death, raped, and murdere</strong></em>d.</h3>

<p>JINOTEPE, NICARAGUA – “It was wrong to let him out. Because maybe if he were locked up he wouldn’t have killed my niece,” Yadira Acevedo cried out, holding back tears.</p>

<p>“What we are asking for is justice,” she continued as she showed me photos of the young woman, Ruth Aburto, on her cracked phone.</p>

<p>On her niece’s killer, the message was simple: “He has to pay!”</p>

<p>Were it not for the efforts of Nicaragua’s political opposition, or for pressure from the US government, Aburto would be alive today.</p>

<p>Tragically, her boyfriend’s name appeared on a database of supposed “political prisoners” compiled by a top US government-backed opposition group. Many of these figures had been jailed for their participation in the violent 2018 attempt to overthrow Nicaragua’s democratically elected government — a failed putsch that relied on heavy participation from career criminals to maintain economically punishing roadblocks around the country.</p>

<p>Aburto’s would-be killer was freed in a 2019 amnesty process demanded by Washington and the Organization of American States. He went on to stab his pregnant 22-year-old girlfriend in the back of the head three times, leaving her to die in a puddle of her own blood.</p>

<p>Other supposed political prisoners the Nicaraguan opposition advocated for had been convicted not of political violence, but rather of crimes like murder, rape, and drug trafficking.</p>

<p>The sweeping pardons of these prisoners were controversial among the leftist base of Nicaragua’s ruling Sandinista government. Many activists had seen their friends and loved ones tortured and even brutally murdered by the prisoners during the coup attempt, and wanted them to serve their time.</p>

<p>But the pressure on the Nicaraguan government to release the imprisoned insurgents was intense and multifaceted; it came not only from inside the country, but also from powerful forces abroad, including the United States, the Organization of American States (OAS), and well-funded international human rights NGOs.</p>

<p>The release of these prisoners in the amnesty process has resulted in a new series of crimes that have shaken Nicaraguan society, raising questions about the true agenda of the country’s political opposition and its relationship to violent criminal networks.</p>

<p>I traveled to Nicaragua to speak with family members of the victims and chronicle the shocking story of how the right-wing political opposition, business elites, the US government, and the OAS joined forces to free a collection of murderers, rapists, and drug dealers they had branded as courageous dissidents.</p>

<p>Throughout my reporting, I met with bereaved family members who told me through tears that the released criminals were “psychopaths” who should have stayed behind bars. They implored the international media to draw attention to their plight — but so far, the English-language press has ignored the scandal.</p>

<p>“I think that if the [opposition umbrella group] Civic Alliance claims he is a ‘political prisoner,’ they are going to let him out again, and I think that is not right,” Ruth’s cousin Rosa Acevedo remarked to me. “He is a killer.”</p>

<p>“This kind of person,” she continued, her voice filled with contempt, “they are society’s parasites, scum!”</p>

<h3>Pardoned ‘political prisoner’ stabs his pregnant girlfriend to death</h3>

<p>Throughout the 2018 coup attempt, and in the aftermath, Nicaragua’s US-backed opposition incessantly demanded the release of all supposed political prisoners, immediately, without condition.</p>

<p>What exactly made someone a political prisoner was difficult to define. Major opposition groups threw around the term liberally, essentially to refer to all those detained in the coup attempt. Hundreds of insurgents were locked up for crimes committed in the “tranques,” or barricades the putschists had erected in an attempt to paralyze the country and wrest territory away from the Sandinista government.</p>

<p>By July 19, 2018, the US-backed coup efforts that had been launched in April had fizzled out. This date marked the annual celebration of the 1979 <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2019/08/22/nicaragua-sandinista-revolution-40th-anniversary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandinista Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which revolutionaries ousted a right-wing military dictatorship that had for decades been propped up by Washington, and hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans gathered in the capital Managua to commemorate the uprising — and demand peace.</span></p>

<p>But the failure of the three-month putsch did not ensure the kind of stability the country had enjoyed for so many years following its civil war in the 1980s. So President Daniel Ortega launched a <a href="https://www.cvjp.org.ni/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission of Truth, Justice, and Peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to oversee the creation of </span><a href="https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:93140-nicaragua-creara-10000-comisiones-mas-de-reconciliacion-justicia-y-paz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10,000 local-level reconciliation committees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could bring the country back together.</span></p>

<p>Under heavy pressure from the US government, OAS, and international media, the Sandinista government agreed in February 2019 to negotiate with the opposition for a general amnesty for prisoners.</p>

<p>The group of “political prisoners” that ended up being advocated for in these negotiations was ultimately chosen by the Alianza Cívica por la Justicia y la Democracia, or Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy (ACJD), a coalition of right-wing opposition groups and business elites that had been formed during the 2018 coup attempt, with the backing of the US government.</p>

<p>The Civic Alliance, which is led by wealthy families who ruled Nicaragua before the Sandinistas took power and which coordinates closely with Washington and the OAS, sat across the table from the government in the amnesty talks, serving as the official voice of the opposition.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Civic Alliance selected the group of “political prisoners” to be freed using the research of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40alianzacivicani%20from%3ACPLPP_Nicaragua&amp;src=typed_query"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely allied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opposition groups: the Comité Pro Liberación de Presos Políticos (Committee Pro-Liberation of Political Prisoners) and the Centro Nicaragüense de Derechos Humanos, or Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (CENIDH). The latter organization has been </span><a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2019/08/25/deaths-for-dollars-nicaraguas-human-rights-organizations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily criticized for publishing dubious, compromised data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the death toll during the 2018 coup attempt.</span></p>

<p>This case was no exception to the troubling trend. The committee and CENIDH used data sets that were almost identical, and which included numerous murderers and rapists, some of whom were arrested well before the coup attempt had even started.</p>

<p>On the first day of these amnesty negotiations, February 27, President Ortega approved a major concession: the release of 100 prisoners who were included in the opposition’s database. This diplomatic gesture was followed by a series of pardons of hundreds more “political prisoners” in the months that came after.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortega’s compromise was celebrated by the press, which blindly echoed the opposition’s perspective. Spain’s top newspaper </span><a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/02/27/america/1551280403_626160.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El País</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uncritically referred to the pardoned criminals as “political prisoners.” The corporate transnational giant</span> <a href="https://www.univision.com/noticias/america-latina/la-proxima-liberada-sera-nicaragua-excarcelan-a-100-presos-politicos-previo-a-las-negociaciones-entre-gobierno-y-oposicion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Univision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adopted the same language, as did the US government’s </span><a href="https://www.voanoticias.com/a/nicaragua-managua-periodistas-liberados-daniel-ortega/4805925.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice of America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicaragua’s La Prensa, a right-wing voice of the opposition that has historically been heavily <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/24/world/furor-in-nicaragua-on-cia-charges.html">funded by the US government</a> to push anti-Sandinista propaganda, published a report that same day </span><a href="https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2019/02/27/nacionales/2528764-los-100-presos-politicos-a-los-que-el-regimen-orteguista-otorgo-la-medida-de-casa-por-carcel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">listing the 100 “political prisoners”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who were freed by the “Ortega regime.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the men included on La Prensa’s list was Jeison Joesma Castro Ortez. He had originally been arrested in July 2018, in the middle of the coup attempt, and was sentenced to 13 years in prison on charges of terrorism, armed robbery, and organized crime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicaraguan police officials said he had tried to set off a makeshift bomb near a police barracks in the city of Jinotepe. Castro Ortez was sentenced with attempting to kill and rob people as they passed through the roadblock he manned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While foreign-backed ostensible “human rights” organizations vigorously lobbied for the release of prisoners like Castro Ortez, their advocacy has ultimately led to more senseless violence across Nicaragua.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, after being released in February 2019, this supposed “political prisoner” returned to his violent ways.</span></p>

<h3>The lonesome death of Ruth Aburto</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2020, a young woman named Ruth Elizabeth Aburto Acevedo was brutally murdered in her home in the city of Jinotepe. Her boyfriend had killed her, first puncturing her hand and then stabbing her three times in the back of the head. He subsequently fled the scene, leaving her to die in her own blood, before he was eventually apprehended by the police.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aburto was just 22 years old at the time. And she had been pregnant. Her boyfriend also killed their unborn child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man who murdered her in such a monstrous fashion was named Jeison Castro Ortez — the same so-called “political prisoner” whose release the opposition had successfully secured less than 11 months before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicaraguan outlets like </span><a href="https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2020/01/20/departamentales/2631569-hombre-mata-a-su-pareja-y-se-da-a-la-fuga-en-jinotepe-carazo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Prensa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://100noticias.com.ni/nacionales/98103-presunto-femicida-es-presentado-en-juzgados-jinote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% Noticias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have published a stream of reports on the notorious femicide. But the coverage in these right-wing mouthpieces has conveniently failed to mention that the killer’s freedom – and his girlfriend’s heinous death – were the byproducts of opposition lobbying.</span></p>

<h3><b>Family members of victim denounce release of ‘psychopath’ killer</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I traveled to a small village on the outskirts of Jinotepe, Nicaragua, roughly an hour and a half drive outside the capital, to speak with members of Ruth Aburto Acevedo’s family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the home where Ruth was raised, a modest structure with a new coat of bright yellow paint outside and a breezy interior, I met Ruth’s aunt and two of her cousins. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sense of grief was immediately palpable. Ruth’s mother had died roughly a year before she was killed.  Worried that the victim’s grandmother, who is in poor health and has been bed-ridden since the news broke, could not bear to know the real story, the family told her instead that Ruth passed away in an accident. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke first with Ruth’s aunt, Yadira Araceli Acevedo Vado. Through tears, Yadira described Ruth as a hard-working nurse who loved her job and was passionate about helping people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yadira also repeatedly described her late niece’s boyfriend as “a killer and a psychopath,” a criminal who frightened her in the few encounters they had.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She lamented that he was released from prison, insisting, “It was wrong to let him out. Because maybe if he were locked up he wouldn’t have killed my niece.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we are asking for is justice,” she stressed. “He has to pay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her description of Jeison Castro Ortez fit that of the archetypal “vandálico,” a term Nicaraguans use to refer to the violent criminals who participated in the coup attempt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In popular discourse, pro-government Nicaraguans (who make up roughly two-thirds of the population) refer to those who participated in the tranques as “criminales” and “delincuentes,” criminals and delinquents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the coup’s participants have admitted that they were paid for their activities — and not just with cash, but with drugs. In our interview, Yadira’s characterization of Castro Ortez reflected this image.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She was going out with this man for four months,” Yadira explained. “We always saw him as strange. He would always bring her, and then he would leave. They came together, and he would always leave her. But we never thought it would come to this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And sometimes I told her, because one day she showed up with a black eye, and I asked her, ‘Ruth, what happened to you?’ I hugged her, and I gave her a kiss. She lifted her head and told me, ‘Auntie, nothing. Nothing is going on with me.’ So I told her, ‘Look, tell us if this man did something to you.’ She dropped her head and didn’t say anything,” her aunt recalled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yadira described Ruth as a kind young woman with a loving heart, who ultimately found herself stuck in a tragic situation she could not extricate herself from.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately she met this man, this animal, on her path,” the aunt reflected. “And now what we want is justice, so there is not impunity, so that he pays for what he did. “And her siblings, all of us are destroyed. And my mother is there in bed, shattered.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yadira repeatedly referred to Castro Ortez as a “psychopath” and an “animal.” She said he made violent comments when they first met.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One day he was like interrogating her,” she recalled. “So I said to him, ‘Are you jealous?’ [And he responded] ‘Yes! I’m jealous. So much I could even kill my own mother out of jealousy.’ That’s how he answered me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yadira noticed that Ruth began to transform during her short four-month relationship with Castro Ortez. He took her phone and deleted apps like Whatsapp and Facebook, cutting her off from friends and family. He even forced her to dress differently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was domestic violence, what he did. Simply because he is a psychopath and a killer,” Yadira said, adding that he had a child with another former girlfriend whom he had threatened with violence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recalled how Castro Ortez participated in the violent opposition barricades in Jinotepe, one of the key sites of indiscriminate violence against members of the Sandinista front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Jinotepe, yes, he was there. But we didn’t realize until now that he did what he did. He was quiet about it,” Yadira said. “He even killed people. That’s what people say. He killed people there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added, “If he was capable of doing that to my niece as he did, in cold blood, imagine how he killed her and all that, he tortured her and all that, you can imagine he was capable of doing other things.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruth’s aunt said she had never heard Castro Ortez talk about politics. She assumed he was paid to participate in the tranques.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a shady past before the coup attempt, Yadira noted: “I know that he said he was in Colombia for a long time, and that after he was in Panama.” What he was doing in Colombia and Panama was not clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told Yadira that Castro Ortez had been included on the opposition’s list of political prisoners, she reacted with bewilderment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was wrong to let him out. Because maybe if he were locked up he wouldn’t have killed my niece. Because what he did really hurts,” she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want him to pay for what he did. We don’t want him to come out. We want them to give him the maximum punishment. He is a person who does not deserve any forgiveness, none at all. He cannot leave from there,” Yadira stressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added, “And we are asking for help from the media and everything, that they help us with that.”</span></p>

<h3>‘What he did is femicide’</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosa Idalia Acevedo Acevedo, one of Ruth’s cousins, was visibly angry at the February 2018 release of so-called “political prisoners” like Jeison Castro Ortez.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People like this should not exist, in my opinion. Because in four months, he had four months to get to know her, and to commit this barbarism against her as he did,” she said. “Not just that he killed her, but also that before killing her, he chased her around the room, and first he tortured her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosa added, “People like that, I don’t think they should exist or be alive, because he didn’t stop after the first stabbing. He stabbed her again and again, until the third time, until he killed her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cousin noted that Ruth’s mother had died roughly a year before she herself was killed. This left Ruth to take care of her two siblings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 15 days before she was killed, Ruth had also visited them at the house where we spoke and told them she had plans to keep studying, and that she had just enrolled in a university. She had been planning for the future, before her life was cut short.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we are asking for is that the government creates justice. For the people who kill, and rape, they should not be let out of prison. They need to stay there. Because if they get out, they get out with even more force. And more of a desire to kill and rape,” she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosa also independently confirmed that Castro Ortez had been in the violent barricades in Jinotepe during the coup attempt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was participating in the tranques. But we didn’t realize it at first,” she said. “We didn’t know if he did anything to anybody else. Until now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cousin suspected that he had killed other people. She noted that he traveled a lot, and that there was another murder of a young woman in the Cara&lt;o department where they live.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On Facebook, people sent lots of things, and that sent me something saying she was not the first [murder victim],” Rosa recalled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was even more forceful in her condemnation of the people who lobbied for the release of Castro Ortez.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that if the Civic Alliance claims he is a ‘political prisoner,’ they are going to let him out again, and I think that is not right. He is a killer,” Rosa said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She called on the opposition to do better research. “They have to investigate people well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we want is justice. She was pregnant. So it is a double homicide. And this has to be looked at very closely. Because I don’t think they’re going to give just 20 years or 10 years to someone who killed a person and a baby.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosa added, “This kind of person, they are society’s parasites, scum.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cousin of Ruth, Maykeling Acevedo, stressed in comments to me that Castro Ortez never should have been let out of prison, and that those who lobbied for his release have blood on their hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What he did is femicide. He was not a political prisoner,” Maykeling said. “This is ridiculous, what the Civic Alliance said, he is a woman killer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maykeling, who like Ruth works in Nicaragua’s health sector, told me, “We want him to be thrown in prison. We want justice.”</span></p>

<h3><b>Man accused of murdering elderly woman in 2016 on the list of ‘political prisoners’</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeison Castro Ortez was not the only violent criminal who was included on the Nicaraguan opposition’s list of supposed “political prisoners.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2017, his co-defendant was sentenced to 35 years for </span><a href="https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2017/03/31/departamentales/2208395-pena-maxima-para-hombre-que-violo-y-mato-a-anciana-en-boaco"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rape and murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, charges he accepted.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This alleged case of rape and murder of an elderly woman did not stop Nicaragua’s right-wing opposition and its coterie of so-called “human rights” organizations from listing Garzón Angulo as a political prisoner.</span></p>

But thus far, this scandal has received no English-language media attention.</span></p>

<h3><b>US embassy lobbies for release of violent ‘political prisoners’</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pressure that foreign powers put on Nicaragua to release these so-called “political prisoners” was tremendous. And that pressure continues to this day, even after the Sandinista government has made numerous major concessions and passed a landmark amnesty law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US government and Organization of American States were deeply involved in the amnesty process and the campaign to release “political prisoners.” Both institutions worked closely with the right-wing opposition and lobbied for the release of killers like Jeison Castro Ortez.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the 2018 coup attempt, the US embassy in Nicaragua constantly demanded “the</span><a href="https://ni.usembassy.gov/political-prisoners-in-nicaragua/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unconditional release of all political prisoners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” in </span><a href="https://ni.usembassy.gov/news-events/?search_query=%22political+prisoners%22&amp;date_m="><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after </span><a href="https://ni.usembassy.gov/the-united-states-and-partners-hold-event-on-human-rights-violations-and-abuses-in-nicaragua/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When President Ortega initiated talks to pardon and release the incarcerated insurgents, the US ambassador to Nicaragua, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/USAmbNicaragua/status/1108574300246806528"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin K. Sullivan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tweeted approval: “The commitment to free all the political prisoners is a positive step. They should be freed as soon as possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these efforts, Washington relied heavily on the opposition Civic Alliance and its list of supposed “political prisoners,” </span><a href="https://ni.usembassy.gov/repression-of-human-rights-in-nicaragua/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeatedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> emphasizing in official government press releases, “The </span><a href="https://ni.usembassy.gov/u-s-oas-ambassador-carlos-trujillo-at-oas-permanent-council/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States continues to support the Civic Alliance of Nicaragua</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its efforts to represent the interests of Nicaraguans advocating for freedom, justice, democracy, and change.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Civic Alliance has acted as a cat’s paw of the US government, coordinating closely with the Trump administration to ratchet up the pressure against the elected Sandinista government.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the process of dialogue with President Ortega began in February 2019, the Civic Alliance acted as the official voice of the opposition — and the US government served as its political big brother and international sponsor. The partnership was so obvious that the Sandinista government initially proposed to release those on the group’s “political prisoners” list only if the Civic Alliance agreed to ask its backers in Washington to</span><a href="https://apnews.com/25319b6116ff456da0d83e0193ec88a0"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lift US sanctions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which have undermined Nicaragua’s economy and increased hardships for the country’s working-class.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US government has also bankrolled the “political prisoner” network that pushed for the amnesty. The</span><a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2018/08/20/inside-americas-meddling-machine-the-us-funded-group-that-interferes-in-elections-around-the-globe/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Endowment of Democracy (NED)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a CIA cutout that advances US soft-power interests by funding opposition forces in foreign countries targeted for regime change, gave at least $50,000 in 2019 to a group dedicated to “raising awareness on the situation of political prisoners in Nicaragua,” according to a search of the</span><a href="https://www.ned.org/wp-content/themes/ned/search/grant-search.php?organizationName=&amp;region=&amp;projectCountry=Nicaragua&amp;amount=&amp;fromDate=&amp;toDate=&amp;projectFocus%5B%5D=&amp;search=political+prisoners&amp;maxCount=25&amp;orderBy=Year&amp;start=1&amp;sbmt=1"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">NED grants database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specific organization is not named, but it clearly refers to opposition groups that work under the umbrella of the Civic Alliance. ($50,000 may not be much in the US, but in Nicaragua, the second-poorest country in the Western hemisphere, where the minimum wage is around $200 to $300 per month, it is a substantial sum of money.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grayzone sent a detailed request for comment to the US embassy in Nicaragua, describing the contents of this report and the scandal involving Jeison Castor Ortez. A representative from the US embassy replied several days later with two generic sentences: “The State Department has released a number of statements regarding US policy toward Nicaragua. We don’t have anything further to add but appreciate your giving us the opportunity.”</span></p>

<h3><b>‘Human rights’ groups join the campaign, and lobby for sanctions</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the US government in the massive pressure campaign against Nicaragua were major international “human rights” organizations like <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2018/08/31/human-rights-watch-hrw-praises-extreme-war-hawk-john-mccain/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and Amnesty International. Both of these groups have long been criticized for <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2019/11/20/human-rights-watch-bolivia-coup-massacre/">functioning as arms of the US government</a> and upholding blatant double standards toward Western allies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2018 coup attempt in Nicaragua, HRW and Amnesty International placed the blame squarely on the government for the violence, scarcely ever mentioning the extreme violence of the opposition criminals who set people on fire, murdered Sandinista activists, shot police with mortar cannons, and burned down houses of leftists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amnesty International lobbied for the UN Human Rights Council to take punitive action against Nicaragua while </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AMR4310232019ENGLISH.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoing the highly questionable claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Civic Alliance and Committee Pro-Liberation of Political Prisoners without an ounce of skepticism, simply identifying them as “local groups,” as if they were politically neutral.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRW deployed these alleged “political prisoners” as justification for its </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/19/nicaragua-targeted-sanctions-justice-key-curb-abuses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call for sanctions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Nicaraguan government. The group wrote, “Governments in the Americas and Europe should impose targeted sanctions against top Nicaraguan authorities.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRW Americas director José Miguel Vivanco went on to lobby the US, Canada, and right-wing countries in Latin America to “</span><a href="https://confidencial.com.ni/nicaragua-sanctions-are-the-only-language-that-ortega-and-murillo-understand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">double-down on sanctions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” against Nicaragua as punishment for holding the prisoners.</span></p>

<h3><b>OAS works with right-wing Nicaraguan opposition to push for release of ‘political prisoners’</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandinista government also faced significant pressure from the</span><a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2018/06/01/oas-anti-venezuela-pro-us-bias-right-wing-hypocrisy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Organization of American States (OAS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While posing as an unbiased arbiter of affairs across the Western hemisphere, this organization receives most of its funding from the US government. In fact, the 2018 Congressional Budget Justification stated very clearly that the OAS “promotes U.S. political and economic interests in the Western Hemisphere by countering the influence of anti-U.S. countries such as Venezuela.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the leadership of its fanatically pro-US secretary-general, Luis Almagro, the OAS has become a full-bore weapon of regime change targeting independent leftist governments in Latin America. The OAS played a crucial role</span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-oas-lied-to-the-public-about-the-bolivian-election-and-coup-2019-11-19"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">spreading lies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive the military</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/02/the-oas-has-to-answer-for-its-role-in-the-bolivian-coup"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">coup in Bolivia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, violated its own charter in its strong backing of the Trump administration’s</span><a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2019/04/10/oas-guaido-trump-venezuela-tarre/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">coup attempts in Venezuela,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has set its sights on Nicaragua as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the 2018 coup attempt in Nicaragua, the OAS joined Washington in blaming the Sandinista Front for the violence, endlessly demonizing the democratically elected government with such a degree of vehemence that</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Almagro_OEA2015/status/1075535619370160129"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Almagro frequently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls it the “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Almagro_OEA2015/status/1076270948221943814"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortega-Murillo regime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a reference to Vice President Rosario Murillo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And like the US government, the OAS acted as an international sponsor of the right-wing Civic Alliance in the amnesty talks. Almagro</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Almagro_OEA2015/status/1153394676059320320"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">coordinates closely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Nicaraguan opposition, regularly</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Almagro_OEA2015/status/1105813570804240384"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting with coup leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and lobbying extensively on their behalf.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grayzone contacted the OAS with a detailed request for comment. It did not reply.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almagro has aggressively lobbied for Nicaragua to release its so-called “political prisoners.” In fact, a search of his more than 8,000 tweets shows the OAS chief has only ever mentioned the phrase “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=presos%20pol%C3%ADticos%20from%3AAlmagro_OEA2015&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presos políticos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” (political prisoners) in reference to Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba — the few socialist governments remaining in the region, dubbed by Washington the “troika of tyranny.”</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Almagro’s leadership, the OAS does a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Certificamos%20lista%20de%20presos%20pol%C3%ADticos%20en%22%20from%3AAlmagro_OEA2015&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the dubious list of supposed “political prisoners” in Venezuela, compiled by Foro Penal, a right-wing opposition group that is funded by and closely </span><a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14604"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coordinates with the US government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Almagro has incessantly called for Nicaragua (and Venezuela and Cuba) to release its supposed political prisoners, he acts as though no other countries in North or South America lock people up for political reasons — especially not the right-wing governments that Almagro supports so fervently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well over 100 </span><a href="https://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?o=rn&amp;id=315998&amp;SEO=denuncian-en-chile-42-muertos-y-121-desaparecidos-por-protestas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">activists were disappeared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the 2019 <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/24/chiles-us-backed-shooting-protesters-blinding-maiming-thousands/">protests against the neoliberal policies of Chile’s billionaire President Sebastián Piñera</a>. While obsessing over Nicaragua, Almagro has made no mention of them, and has remained noticeably reticent on rampant human rights violations in Colombia, another nation run by a right-wing US-friendly government.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Nicaraguan President Ortega called for a peace process and dialogue with the opposition, Almagro took a maximalist position, demanding that the government </span><a href="https://confidencial.com.ni/oas-exploring-the-possibility-of-serving-as-a-guarantor-for-the-dialogue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release 770</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so-called political prisoners as a condition for OAS participation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where did Almagro get the 770 figure from? His source, as usual, was the Civic Alliance and CENIDH, whose extremely dubious research the Civic Alliance relied on as well – and whose database of “political prisoners” includes numerous murderers and rapists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While CENIDH purports to be a supposed human rights organization, it acts as a highly partisan voice for the opposition.</span><a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2019/08/25/deaths-for-dollars-nicaraguas-human-rights-organizations/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">John Perry reported for The Grayzone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that CENIDH was founded by an opposition politician with European funding; that it uses openly biased language in its reports, referring to the elected government as a “dictatorial regime”; and inflates death tolls while blaming violence exclusively on the FSLN.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While reporting in Nicaragua, </span><a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2018/07/30/how-washington-and-soft-power-ngos-manipulated-nicaraguas-death-toll-to-drive-regime-change-and-sanctions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grayzone editor Max Blumenthal documented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the direct role CENIDH leadership played in the coup attempt against the Sandinista government. Independent Nicaraguan researcher Enrique Hendrix revealed how CENIDH, along with other opposition-allied “human rights” groups in Nicaragua, padded death counts by including “victims of traffic accidents, altercations between gangs, murders by robbery, those killed by accidental firing of a firearm and even more absurdly, a suicide.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the organization’s major role in the putsch attempt, Nicaragua’s National Assembly voted in December 2018 to</span><a href="https://barricada.com.ni/asamblea-nacional-retira-personeria-juridica-de-organismos-promotores-del-golpe-de-estado/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">revoke the legal status of CENIDH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has not deterred the so-called human rights arm of the OAS, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), from</span><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=cenidh%20from%3Acidh&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">relying extensively</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on CENIDH and its highly questionable data. IACHR has</span><a href="https://twitter.com/CIDH/status/1017117104858914818"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CENIDH’s hyper-partisan figures without any skepticism, and even</span><a href="https://twitter.com/CIDH/status/1025489084389707778"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">collaborated with</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opposition group. IACHR has also</span><a href="https://www.oas.org/es/cidh/prensa/comunicados/2018/265.asp"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lobbied on behalf of CENIDH</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calling for the OAS’ legal arm the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to take action</span><a href="https://www.oas.org/es/cidh/prensa/comunicados/2019/162.asp"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to protect it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing this enormous, international pressure campaign, President Ortega </span><a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/03/21/america/1553131777_006857.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed to release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the supposed “political prisoners” in early 2019. The Nicaraguan government issued a series of pardons over several months: 100 freed in </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-47389740"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 50 more released in </span><a href="https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2019/03/15/politica/2533289-daniel-ortega-excarcela-presos-politicos-en-la-modelo-y-la-esperanza"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another 50 let out in </span><a href="https://www.dw.com/es/gobierno-de-nicaragua-excarcela-a-50-detenidos-en-protestas/a-48232747"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the opposition was not content. It turned to international media outlets that acted as a </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-47592491"><span style="font-weight: 400;">megaphone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Civic Alliance, amplifying its demands that all “political prisoners” be released.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This eventually culminated in June 2019, when the Sandinista-majority National Assembly passed a historic </span><a href="https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:91026-conozca-la-ley-de-amnistia-en-nicaragua"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amnesty law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, officially pardoning prisoners who were arrested after the coup attempt that began on April 18, 2018.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OAS immediately praised the Sandinista government’s concession. In a statement, the organization said it “</span><a href="https://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-042/19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcomes the release of political prisoners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the fact that the agreements have allowed these people to rejoin their families.” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Almagro_OEA2015/status/1138437780063825921"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almagro likewise tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “We welcome the freeing of the 56 political prisoners in Nicaragua according to the [Civic] Alliance-government agreement.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as soon as the amnesty law passed, the right-wing opposition and its international sponsors made it clear that this was not enough. The OAS’ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights </span><a href="https://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2019/145.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for not going far enough, just one day after the organization had welcomed it. The </span><a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/es/iglesia/news/2019-06/nicaragua-ley-amnisti-derechos-humanos-episcopado-iglesia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catholic Church in Nicaragua</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a major player in advancing the coup in 2018 – also complained that the concession was insufficient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few months later, Secretary-General Almagro clamored again for the Nicaraguan government to release more “political prisoners,” directly citing the dubious, highly partisan claims of the Civic Alliance. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opposition-controlled corporate media in Nicaragua chimed in, rattling off one article after another claiming there were hundreds more “political prisoners.” Right-wing students from private universities like the University of Central America joined in as well, organizing </span><a href="https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2020/02/03/politica/2636228-universitarios-demandan-la-libertad-de-los-presos-politicos-en-la-primera-protesta-estudiantil-del-ano"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demanding that they be freed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if the government had not just spent months engaged in arduous negotiations that ended in an agreement for the release of hundreds of prisoners.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This relentless pressure campaign made it clear that the right-wing opposition in Nicaragua and its powerful backers abroad would not be truly content until it fulfilled its real goal: the full removal of the leftist Sandinista movement from power and its purging from public life.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<h3><b>Nicaraguan government says amnesty law was move for peace</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the right-wing opposition demands new rounds of concessions seemingly every week, some of the criminals they advocated for have been wreaking havoc across Nicaraguan society.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Managua, I spoke to Edwin Castro Rivera, the leader of the Sandinista Front party, to better understand the logic behind the amnesty process. He was part of the committee that negotiated with the opposition, and co-authored the amnesty law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castro Rivera stressed the government’s demand for peace and stability. The violent <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/22/us-war-sanctions-nicaragua-icj-carlos-arguello/">US-backed Contra war that savaged Nicaragua in the 1980s</a> had left the country divided, and most Nicaraguans feared a return to the neighbor-against-neighbor violence that tore the country apart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that the coup attempt affected the most, which we had earned in Nicaragua through much effort, is the effort to reunify Nicaraguan families,” he explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning the presidential election in 2006, Daniel Ortega declared the creation of a “Government of Reconciliation and National Unity.” This is still the name of Nicaragua’s government today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That unity we have earned through much effort, with the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, that is why we call it that: Reconciliation and National Unity, because our objective was to reunify the families,” Castro Rivera said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And the coup attempt broke this unity once again. Since then, our main task, after restoring the calm in Nicaragua, was to go back to progressing and rebuilding the familial unity,” he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 putsch plunged Nicaragua into an epidemic of violence it had not seen in decades.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They burnt people alive, and danced around them,” Castro Rivera said of the violent insurgents. “They tortured people who they stripped naked, and painted their bodies. We had never seen this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You only see this in the narco activity in Mexico and in Colombia,” he added. “Because of this, we concluded that there was participation of Mexican and Colombian drug-trafficking groups. And criminals who were paid to do all this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mentioned that Jeison Castro Ortez, the pardoned criminal who killed his pregnant girlfriend, had told her family members that he had spent time in Colombia, although he had not revealed what he was doing there. Castro Rivera was not surprised, and said other incarcerated people on the “political prisoner” list had also spent time in Colombia before the coup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandinista chief stressed that fears of this kind of violence returning is what led the Nicaraguan government to create the Commissions of Reconciliation and Peace, which have worked in small towns all across the country to try to unify the population.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castro Rivera said the government felt it had no choice but to agree to an amnesty process with the opposition, to try to foster this unity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For us, it was a difficult problem, because how are we going to explain to our people, that the criminals who killed your son or your father in cold blood, we’re going to give them amnesty,” he explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was very bitter for us. But it had to be done if we wanted to reclaim the route of reconciliation, the reunification of families. And that was the essential motive of this amnesty.”</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the FSLN leader stressed that the government’s main goal behind the amnesty process was to try to bring the country together, he also conceded that there was a lot of foreign pressure on Nicaragua.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had pressure from the OAS,” Castro Rivera said. And that was compounded by the OAS’ “human rights” arm the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. He called the CIDH “totally biased.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Sandinista government sat down at the dialogue table with the Civic Alliance in 2019, Castro Rivera said one of its main demands was the release of prisoners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the first list of ‘political prisoners’ that they gave us, before the amnesty law, there was a man who murdered his grandmother,” he recalled. “To rob her. He was on drugs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This convict had also been arrested back in 2017, months before the coup attempt. Other violent criminals like him were included on the opposition’s list. Castro Rivera said the case of Jeison Castro Ortez is just one example of a much larger trend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the plethora of career criminals on the opposition’s amnesty list, the government insisted on a stipulation that those granted amnesty also pledge not to repeat the crimes that were pardoned for. This clause, Castro Rivera noted, was based on the Belfast Guidelines on Amnesty and Accountability, a United Nations-backed initiative led by experts in international law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And now they have another list of ‘political prisoners’ that are nothing more than criminals,” Castro Rivera said of the opposition’s latest calls for another amnesty process, just half a year later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandinista negotiation chief offered a few theories on the real goals behind the opposition’s incessant pressure campaign.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a small country, with some economic difficulties, in addition to those that they created in the coup attempt,” Castro Rivera explained. “Our principal wealth is precisely the security and tranquility that is here in Nicaragua. And this is what they want to attack, these very small groups.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a small political group, with economic power, that is convinced that they will never come to power with votes, with the work that Daniel Ortega is doing,” he said. “Daniel’s sin is doing things for the people, and having the support that he has.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2017, the mainstream polling firm M&amp;R Consultores found</span><a href="https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:59153-783-de-nicaraguenses-aprueban-gestion-de-daniel-y-rosario-"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">78.3 percent of Nicaraguans approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the management of the Nicaraguan government.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So this group returns to the tradition” that plagued Nicaragua for decades, Castro Rivera stated: “changing the government with weapons, through a coup d’etat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the other Nicaraguans I spoke to, the FSLN leader lamented the lack of international media coverage of the scandals shaking his country, or of the government’s sacrifices for peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In my experience, the peace processes normally are not in the news. Not only in the English-language media, all over the world,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If there is conflict, automatically it is all over the media. But when the process of peace, tranquility, and normality begins — which you can see here in Nicaragua, in the street, people doing normal activities, economic activities, we return to being the safest country in Central America.”</span></p>

<h3>More opposition violence threatens Nicaragua’s rare stability</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Nicaragua’s right-wing opposition boasts powerful sponsors in Washington, it has little influence at home. The polling firm M&amp;R found in January 2020 that </span><a href="https://www.tn8.tv/nacionales/483846-encuesta-53-votaria-fsln-elecciones-nicaragua/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63.5 percent of Nicaraguans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan to vote for the Sandinista Front in the 2021 election, whereas only around 11.5 percent of the population actively support the opposition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular enthusiasm for the Sandinistas is made clear with <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton/status/1223676130227630081">heavily attended, festive marches held in Managua each Saturday</a>. Meanwhile, the opposition spends much of its time in closed-door <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/07/nicaragua-opposition-support-us-eu-coalition/">meetings with business people and representatives of foreign governments and organizations</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The source of popular support for the Sandinista Front is also apparent: The government has drastically reduced inequality; created systems of free, universal healthcare and education; empowered women, attaining the world’s </span><a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Nicaragua-in-Fifth-Position-For-Gender-Equality-in-The-World-20181218-0032.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fifth-highest level of gender equality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and managed to bring Nicaragua the peace and stability that has been elusive in Central America’s violence-ridden Northern Triangle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the sweeping prisoner amnesty the government granted under massive pressure by the opposition and the US has thrown the country’s fragile peace into peril again. Droves of criminals with lengthy rap sheets have been freed, and one has already murdered a pregnant 22-year-old woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many more families will be torn apart in the opposition’s desperate bid for power? This question now haunts too many Nicaraguans.</span></p>
