<p><strong>ADDRESS BY NICARAGUA<br />
IV FORUM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA AND POLITICAL PARTIES<br />
OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN</strong></p>

<p><strong>Beijing, People's Republic of China.<br />
<br />
2nd-3rd December, 2024</strong></p>

<p>Esteemed Authorities and Leaders of the Communist Party of China, convening today in revolutionary fraternity.</p>

<p>We salute Brother Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.</p>

<p>Esteemed Comrades, Leaders and Delegates of the Political Parties attending this IV Forum of the Communist Party of China and the Political Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Nicaragua, A Free and Sovereign Nation, greets and thanks you for the opportunity to share with you the reflections and lessons that our struggles, sacrifices and victories have taught us, as Peoples, Parties and Regions of the world.</p>

<p>We come to this Forum, as Blessed and Always Free Nicaragua, as the People of Andrés Castro, of Rubén Darío, of the Heroe Benjamín Zeledón, of the General of Free Men and Women Augusto C. Sandino, to transmit the fraternal embrace of Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of Our Blessed Nicaragua and of Compañera Rosario Murillo, Vice President of our Beloved Nicaragua. Both, Leaders of the People, of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation and of our Revolutionary Government.</p>

<p>Our Party, the FSLN, the vanguard of the Nicaraguan people, works permanently in defending the Revolution and attending the strategic priorities established in the Historic Program of the FSLN and the Human Development Plans. One of our main struggles is the fight against poverty and for human development, to eradicate social inequality.</p>

<p>The visible and concrete results that the people can see is the affirmation of the Nicaraguan People in their Revolutionary and Evolutionary project. That, for us, is an indication of being on the right path and a validation of our goals and objectives.</p>

<p>Within this framework, as a consequence of exercising our political sovereignty and the full freedom of our self-determination, since December 2021, Nicaragua and China affirmed and ratified the fraternal political relations between our peoples, states and political parties, which on its second anniversary, Presidents Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China and Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, President of our Blessed and Always Free Nicaragua, elevated the binational relations to the level of STRATEGIC ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>The qualitative leap is fundamental for our country, as we believe and affirm that China is one of the cornerstones on which the foundations of the new world that has already been born are based, and that is strengthened and expanded every day.</p>

<p>Both China and Nicaragua recognize the mutual trust in their governments, the practical cooperation and solidarity in various areas and aspects, and firm collaboration in multilateral forums. For the Nicaraguan people, the Unity of the Chinese People, the full Integrity of its territory, contained in the One China Doctrine, and the absolute Sovereignty over all Actions in order to exercise self-determination, are inalienable rights and deserve the respect of the entire world.</p>

<p>The times we live in are marked by transcendent and extraordinary steps towards better horizons for our Peoples. The creation of The Belt and Road Initiative is a different, fraternal model, deeply conscious of the need to see other regions of the world as brothers and sisters, comrades and co-builders of a new multipolar world. In this context, our parties are working to ensure that these new forms of communication, economic and social relations between peoples, are effectively incorporated into the legitimate aspirations of our societies.</p>

<p>Nicaragua recognizes the respectful forms and mechanisms of Political Communication, openness, respect and cooperation, which translates into a permanent policy of Peace Promotion by China who, together with other States, has worked tirelessly so that conflicts such as the War in Ukraine (brought about by the irrational aggressive attitude of NATO against the Russian Federation), those in the Middle East (Zionist aggressions), and those in Africa, can find in the channels of negotiation and the search for Peace the necessary solutions for these conflicts, which are created, promoted, financed and sustained by the same enemies of Peace as Always: Imperialism and its Obedient Lackey Governments.</p>

<p>Nicaragua and other Free Peoples, as well as revolutionary Political Parties and Organizations, have adhered to China’s Peacemaking efforts very promptly and opportunely, because we believe that the Search for Peace is an essential condition for Life in Full Freedom.</p>

<p>But the eternal enemies of humanity work, conspire and act on these new realities of the contemporary world:</p>

<p>* An increasingly active and growing aggressive expansion of North American Imperialism is manifested, turning the political action of the so-called Collective West into its simple subordinate lackeys, even, to the detriment of the national interests of each State, leading them to pusillanimous servitude. Unfortunately, Europe and some Asian and Latin American governments follow this. The Monroe Doctrine, Manifest Destiny, is already known. Now, North American imperialism is releasing a variant of its Fascist Thought: “WE WILL IMPOSE A PEACE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE USA AND ALLIES…. BY FORCE”</p>

<p>* The Zionist war and attempted extermination in and against Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Iran; the aggressions and interventions in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, and many other peoples of the world are confronted by the aggressive and military models of the North American empire. The use of unilateral coercive measures (sanctions, blockades, financial walls, widely known and declared illegal and immoral worldwide) is added to other fascist actions such as the extortionate measures that many governments and parties of the world suffer "quietly". They threaten so-called progressive governments and even those of the right, as well as "collaborators and enthusiastic" who condemn revolutionary governments which are not docile to the empire, so as to maintain behaviors obedient to imperial policies. They display themselves in forums, any other political circus or show set up for such purposes.</p>

<p>We have denounced around the world the common risks we face, and the tactics of all kinds being used by the enemies of humanity:</p>

<p>Disunity between parties, leaders and social sectors, of the progressive and revolutionary sectors; very elaborate operations, structured, organized and financed in the spheres of political intelligence of specialized agencies, whose sources of financing are no longer hidden: USAID, EU Cooperation, Foundations such as Soros, NED, IRI and many others.</p>

<p>Frictions and separations between Revolutionary or Progressive Parties and Governments, seeking to break fraternal solidarity and the coordinated work of movements against the Empire. The substitution of the legitimate banners of the people by PROPAGANDA "mirrors" for the consequent "democratic validation" by electoral options and "Institutional Power". All this through the ungrateful, persistent and diabolical work of parasitic NGOs of North American and European economic patrons.</p>

<p>Global media campaigns of discredit, the hunting of government leaders and political party leaders who are committed to their peoples, the infamous chains of isolation, sanctions and aggressive condemnatory measures and even the denial of electoral processes in which revolutionary leaders triumph, are commonly used to attack peoples.</p>

<p>Nicaragua faces these and other forms of aggressions, which we have been defeating with persistence, unity, firmness, determination and courage, driven by the strength of our convictions and the heroism of our People. They could not prevail nor will they!!!!</p>

<p>It is essential that our Parties, which emerged from the depths of the People themselves, understand their historical mission, their generational responsibilities and their political obligations. From this, we have learned that:</p>

<p>1. Standing firm and consistently with the people in the tasks of building Popular Governance ensures that the Party strengthens its authority and its role as an extraordinary instrument, as a driver and driving force in the tasks to be accomplished.</p>

<p>2. Always work to educate the militants in patriotic and revolutionary values, taking the historical lessons of national unity, to face the tasks of ideological debate and moral strength of the vanguard.</p>

<p>3. Understand the political environment, always studying the immediate enemy, that is, the right and local fascism, and not lose sight of the strategies of world fascism. Educating in the principles of international solidarity and fraternity of struggle are essential for the permanent strengthening of the Parties.</p>

<p>In our Nicaragua, some of the most radiant, rock-solid treasures are UNITY, Support for the People and Confidence in strategic Victory.</p>

<p>In order to achieve strategic objectives, the constant construction of communication and empowerment of the popular masses of its Project is the guarantee of success and achievements. We Revolutionaries do not forget that the Parties are Collective Instruments, which belong unequivocally to the People. This sense of belonging and appropriation is undoubtedly the source of the organic strength of the Party.</p>

<p>Our peoples always find in internationalist solidarity new expressions of struggle and new paths towards Victory, both for our Parties and our Peoples. The various anti-fascist and anti-imperialist internationals and the struggle of social movements are built on very common and unifying axes. The principles of dignity, patriotism, sovereignty, self-determination and independence endlessly nourish the convictions of freedom and peace in which the peoples of this land must live.</p>

<p>The New World has already been born, it is growing and strengthening. Let us all be equals, forgers of the new victories that will set out the new paths of Peace in which Humanity must live.</p>

<p>Long live the Communist Party of China!!<br />
Long live the Revolutionary Parties of Latin America and the World!!<br />
Long live the People's Republic of China!!<br />
Long live Nicaragua!!!<br />
