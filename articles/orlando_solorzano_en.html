      <br>
This interview demonstrates several key elements of the development of
the FSLN government's domestic and foreign policy. Internally, Orlando
Solorzano outlines his ministry's policy of dialogue, the emphasis on
production and investment, the support for sectors that were most
excluded by previous governments. These are policies which have left
the right wing opposition, unable to match the creativity, experience
and capability of the government's economic approach, without arguments.<br>
      <br>
As regards government foreign policy, Orlando Solorzano reminds us of
the historic role of the Central American economic integration process
in promoting peace in the region. Deriving from that reality are many
crucial aspects of the Nicaraguan government's foreign policy - a
policy which ensures the country has a strategic role and presence in
regional development, converting Nicaragua into a decisive
counterweight to the agenda mapped out by the Western Bloc countries
(the US, Europe and their Pacific allies) for Central America.<br>
      <br>
Minister Orlando Solorzano began the conversation with a few remarks
about the role of the Industry and Commerce Ministry (MIFIC) in
Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
Orlando Solorzano: A new Nicaragua with new opportunities for the poor
is possible. We all work towards that end. We want to achieve an ideal,
and it is an achievable ideal, we want to contribute as much as
possible so that these objectives are fulfilled. In that sense - and
because we are in love with this process - we are poets. The Finance
Minister is a poet. The Industry and Commerce Minister, that's me, is a
poet. All the members of the government are poets. From the President
down, we are all working towards a change so that our children and
grandchildren can inherit a different country. In that sense, we are
all poets.<br>
      <br>
You ask me about the goals and achievements of the last few years.
Well, this is the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. We promote the
productive development of the country, the industrial and commercial
development. And we annex social development onto that. We are working
towards productive, commercial and social development. Because the end
goal of everything we do is social development for the benefit of our
people.<br>
      <br>
In MIFIC - that's what we call the ministry, athough sometimes people
also refer to it as the Economy Ministry - we are responsible for
exports, we manage the country's export system. There are laws and
there is a framework of reference for export companies, and within that
framework around 75% of companies, representing 60% of the country's
overall exports, are registered.<br>
      <br>
This is a system of temporary admission. It is a regime that promotes
exporting activity. In MIFIC we stimulate exports. We resolve problems
to do with different limitations that may exist. We contribute to the
search for different markets, to the search for investments. The
promotion of investments is very important because one of the things
that is missing in countries like ours, in developing countries, is
investment capital. For that reason we work to promote investment.<br>
      <br>
Also relevant to the subject of exports is the free trade zone system
which we administer. We participate in the Free Trade Zone Commission
which is managed by a different executive entity - the Free Trade Zone
Corporation.<br>
      <br>
Apart from that, we are the ones that carry out negotiations to do with
foreign trade, international trade negotiations. We participate in the
WTO [World Trade Organization]. Nicaragua is party to a network of
commercial treaties and agreements starting with the Central American
Economic Interests Treaty.<br>
      <br>
The strategic importance of regional integration<br>
      <br>
We also participate in the [Central American] regional integration
process which is one of the oldest integration processes in the world.
The Central American process began in 1960, almost at the same time as
the European Union's Rome Treaty. At the time it was said that these
two integration processes were the most advanced in the world - one
involving developed countries and the other involving developing
countries.<br>
      <br>
Unfortunately, though, we feel that the Central American integration
process has fallen behind. This is due in part to external influences
and in part to Central America's own dynamic, for example the conflicts
that have taken place at different times - political conflicts and even
military conflicts.<br>
      <br>
But, fortunately, even though now we consider those conflicts to have
affected the integration process, to have prevented greater progress
within the integration process, we also consider the integration
process itself to have served as a tool, as an instrument with which to
promote peace in Central America. It is a proven fact - the integration
process has been used as an instrument of peace in Central America.<br>
      <br>
It was thanks to dialogue and to negotiation in the 80s, for example,
that the war was brought to an end. There was a war of aggression in
Nicaragua - an intervention. It was also thanks to dialogue and
negotiation that peace agreements were reached in other countries like
El Salvador and Guatemala. We reached a regional peace agreement
referred to as the Esquipulas agreement. And that would not have been
possible without the conception of an integration process between the
Central American countries. And so integration was used as an
instrument of peace.<br>
      <br>
Now we have the [Central American] integration process and we also have
commercial treaties with Mexico, we have a commercial protocol with the
US - CAFTA. We are coming to the end of the negotiation of a commercial
agreement with Canada. We have commercial treaties with Taiwan. We also
participate in the ALBA integration process - the Bolivarian Alliance
for the Americas. On top of all that we are negotiating an Association
Agreement with the European Union.<br>
      <br>
What is the objective, the strategy behind all these negotiations?
Firstly, that Nicaragua has a range of commercial agreements and
treaties that extend access to different markets. And secondly, we
believe that certain commercial treaties complement the others. For
example, we do not believe, as some people have said, that the
Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, ALBA, contradicts CAFTA <br>
      <br>
Naturally they are the products of two different political
philosophies, but that doesn't mean that in real terms they cannot be
considered to complement each other. We consider ALBA as complementary
to CAFTA. And we consider the Association Agreement with the European
Union as complementary of ALBA and CAFTA. We have been weaving a
network of commercial treaties, association agreements and integration
agreements in order to ensure access to markets and greater commercial
and productive complementarity.<br>
      <br>
In the case of free trade agreements, like CAFTA, we are talking about
access to markets and trade relations. In the case of Central America
we are talking about an integration process. Likewise with ALBA. In
terms of our relations with the rest of Latin America, we tend to move
towards integration relations and not just commercial relations. And as
a result we achieved access to a wide range of markets. <br>
      <br>
Internal trade<br>
      <br>
Another very important area that we manage in this ministry is internal
trade. Within the institution we have the Office of Consumer Defence,
the Technical Norms Office, we also represent the presidency of the
National Commission of Norms and the National Commission of
Measurements - which is very important because it allows us to
determine the quality of our products, the norms our products should
comply with in order to be able to reach the international market. <br>
      <br>
On top of this we are strengthening the organization of our internal
market. All over the world the organization of internal markets exists,
in European countries, in Asian countries as well. In Nicaragua we have
had quite a disorganized internal market and we are working towards
improving on that. We want to articulate the market better with more
communication with producers, merchants and consumers. The effect of
this policy is to suppress certain inconsistencies that affect the
fluidity of the market. We have good relations with the private sector,
with big, medium and small business. All these sectors are contributing
to the well-being of the country. <br>
      <br>
Among the government's policies is the policy to establish trust
between investors, producers and the government. Thanks to the trust
that has been created and to the government's policies in general, we
have been able to oversee a major increase in production. In terms of
agricultural production, for example, we are able to confirm that
production increased by approximately 5% last year. This year, despite
the drought, which badly affected us, production of the main
agricultural products increased.<br>
      <br>
We have overseen an increase in the production of rice, in the
production of beans, corn, different sorts of cooking oils and of other
basic food stuffs. In fact, Nicaragua is positioning itself as the main
exporter of agricultural products to Central America. That is very
important because in today's world we are not only confronted by an
environmental crisis, by climate change, but by a food crisis. Within
that context Nicaragua's position is very important because we are big
producers and we have great agricultural potential. <br>
      <br>
We also have a strategic position for our commercial activities.
Nicaragua has coasts on both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.
Nicaragua is part of the Central American isthmus with a very good
position in terms of accessing important markets, for example the US
market via CAFTA. This is one of the elements that we consider as part
of our programs aimed at attracting investment. <br>
      <br>
Of course the internal market is relatively small because we are a
small country. But we are part of a process of regional integration, we
have free trade agreements with Mexico and the US, with ALBA in the
South, and with other Latin American countries as well, we are
participating also in the so called Pacific Arch, and in an association
agreement with Europe. That is the basis of the strategy that we are
following. <br>
      <br>
Production and markets<br>
      <br>
We have access to markets, we are attractive to investors, but there is
a weakness and that is that our production levels are still not as high
as they should be, neither in terms of volume nor in terms of
diversity, in order to maintain the country's long term economic
development. So what we need to do now is to increase production. And
we have the potential. <br>
      <br>
We have great human potential, great potential in terms of natural
resources and we have markets. Nicaragua can think of itself as a port
for as much as we can produce, mainly agro-industrial products, to
cover markets in third countries. As a result we have avoided the
tendency towards one foreign market. The US market receives about 30%
of Nicaragua's exports. Central America also receives around 30% of our
exports.<br>
      <br>
Some years the Central American market is more important than the US
market. Other years it is the US market that is more important. The
importance of each market varies from year to year depending on the
prices of the products we are exporting. <br>
      <br>
With ALBA we have opened new markets. Now a significant proportion of
our exports go to Venezuela. Nicaraguan exports to Venezuela have been
increasing rapidly to the extent that last year I think 8% of total
exports went to Venezuela and this year as much as 15% of Nicaraguan
exports will go to Venezuela. That represents a rapid increase.<br>
      <br>
Our exports were affected by the international crisis, a financial and
economic crisis, but not to the extent other countries were affected.
Perhaps this is because our exports are mainly food products. And
because our economy is not an economy of banks, paper and bonds. Our
economy comes from the earth, it is an economy based on agricultural
production, on coffee, sugar, and on other foods like grains, meat,
cattle, milk, cheese. Perhaps this has meant that the crisis has not
affected Nicaragua as much as it has affected other countries.<br>
      <br>
Here, in Nicaragua, we are working to improve production. We believe
that one of the main problems or limitations that this country has had
is regarding organization. We are strengthening the organization of the
cooperatives, of the MIPYMES (micro, small and medium businesses). We
have a special program involving financial assistance for the MIPYMES. <br>
      <br>
We think that our small and medium sized companies could have greater
access to international markets. And some are already exporting, mainly
crafts and other products produced by Pymes for example hammocks and
coffee. <br>
      <br>
Now [the international market] differentiates between different types
of coffee, and in Nicaragua we are talking about high quality coffee
produced by small farmers. In both cases - coffee and hammocks - the
producers communicate directly with the international market. It's
surprising to see how in places so far from the capital producers are
able to connect to the Internet and connect themselves to the
international market. That is how they have been able to take advantage
of opportunities that have arisen. <br>
      <br>
Our strategy is to move towards greater organization and towards
territorialization - we are going to divide the country into
territories. It would not be appropriate to concentrate all our
capacity in Managua because the greatest need is located outside
Managua. That is why last year we opened different offices in the main
towns of Nicaragua's departments. We created CAPYMEs - Support centers
for PYMEs. They work together with the local governments providing
support and offering the services that, here in Managua, MIFIC
provides. That way we aim to provide different services to producers
outside the capital. We have opened twelve offices in different towns
and we are going to organize another four in four further towns for a
total of 16 offices. <br>
      <br>
The legacy of neoliberalism <br>
      <br>
With regard to the neo liberal model, we believe that we are overcoming
the 16 years that came after the revolution in the 80s. Much of our
efforts in the 80s were destroyed in the 90s and the first few years of
this decade. For example, towards the end of the 1980s [the FSLN
government] was preparing for the construction of a deep water port on
the Atlantic Coast - everything was ready, the machinery was there, the
cement had been bought, the plans were finalized, the dredgers were
there. But when we came to government again in 2007 all that had
disappeared. It didn't exist any more. We have to start all over again.
      <br>
      <br>
There were also State owned farms, big milk and cheese producers with
first class cattle imported from different parts of the world - in
Chiltepe, that was an enormous project. That disappeared as well. In
the Valley of Sébaco there was an agro-industrial plant. That also
disappeared. The July Victory Sugar Processing Plant - one of the most
modern in Central America - that also disappeared. The railway system,
which wasn't new, it was outdated - but it existed! - that also
disappeared. Even the railway tracks disappeared.<br>
      <br>
So, we had big projects that we had worked on, that we had carried out,
that we had great hopes in, but which disappeared. Why? Because during
those 16 years of neo-liberalism the logic was that the State should
not have anything to do with those projects. That the State should not
act. That the State was nothing more than a vehicle for laissez faire,
laissez passer - a shopkeeper waiting quietly in the corner of a store
while the client looks for what he wants. <br>
      <br>
We, on the other hand, have a different philosophy. We believe that the
State in small developing countries like Nicaragua is a very important
promoter of the country's development. The State is not a shopkeeper
showing clients around his store. No. The State goes out to look for
clients and establishes inclusive economic and social programs in
different territories to promote development. <br>
      <br>
We believe in a proactive State, a revolutionary State - why
revolutionary? Because from our point of view we are making changes
that the country needs to reduce the limitations that get in the way of
social and economic development. And we are carrying out those changes
gradually, as is necessary, but without losing from sight the final
objective. And because we are carrying out those changes with the full
participation of all the productive sectors, with a special emphasis on
the smallest sectors. This is taking place within the model of Citizen
Participation. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Citizen Power<br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua, historically citizens did not even participate even in
elections. Historically citizen participation was very low. Today we do
not think that participation should begin and end at election time,
because that is so limited, it is limited to participating once every
time there is going to be a new government. We believe that
participation should be a daily event. It should be continuous. We are
organizing Production Councils in the different territories, in the
different cities, in the different towns. These Production Councils are
designed to move society's capacity towards production.<br>
      <br>
Because the Revolution has forces that, generally, are not detected by
macro-economic indicators in the same way that macro economic
indicators do not detect the reality of the poorest sectors of society.
Everything is reduced to the GDP in each country, divided by the number
of inhabitants to calculate the per capita GDP. In the same way that
these indicators fail to detect the social reality behind a very low
per capita GDP of US$1,000 a year, they also fail to detect the
instruments that the country can use, that the people can use for their
own development. And there are instruments that can be used. <br>
      <br>
Consumers are not just consumers. Neo-liberalism sees consumers as a
mass, a mass of nothing more than consumers. But organized consumers
with the mentality of producers - that is not registered by any of the
indicators. We want to awake our society's productive capacity in
different sectors of society and within different productive activities
- social capacity, social organization to stimulate production. We call
these the Production Councils [which function within the] Citizen Power
model which is the direct participation of the people, of these
organizations, in the struggle for the social and economic well being
of their country. We want to analyse and focus [that struggle] towards
the productive capacity of the country. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua has enormous potential. It's a country that has been blessed
by God. He has given us very great, very diverse resources. Here we
have the best land in the world for agricultural production, we have
mines, we have water, we have coasts on both oceans, we have large,
beautiful lakes. Our two big lakes together cover about 10,000 sq. kms.
We can cultivate fish in those lakes and also fish in both oceans. We
have a good strategic position and we have a marvellous climate. Our
people are specialists in agriculture. Our workers are very efficient. <br>
      <br>
So, if we have all that potential, what is missing? What is missing is
capital. So here what we are doing is awakening social capacity for
production and looking for capital in order to be able to develop our
agricultural production and our industrial production. <br>
      <br>
Tortilla con Sal: How important, in this context, are the visits, for
example, by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, and by other
top level officials?<br>
      <br>
OS: Very important. We are negotiating different productive projects
with Russia. The inter-oceanic channel has been mentioned, for example.
A huge irrigation project for the Pacific part of the country has been
mentioned. And when we talk about channels, or irrigation systems, or
other projects, we are not excluding other countries. We have relations
we many different countries of the world. Visits from people like
Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, and from other people that have
come here to strengthen our relations, to improve the capacity in our
markets, and to attract investment with big projects which could be a
public investment or it could be private - these sorts of visits are
very important. <br>
      <br>
Environment and labour rights <br>
      <br>
TcS: How do you see the possible conflict between the arrival of these
big investments and the need to protect the environment? For example,
recently the possibility of opening a mine near the famous San Albino
mine close to Quilalí was mentioned. Concerns regarding mining company
investments are always to do with the environmental impact. Is this a
subject that concerns you?<br>
      <br>
OS: Yes we are concerned about that issue. In Nicaragua there are
environmental laws. And there is an Environment Ministry that is
responsible for implementing those laws. It is a strong Ministry, and
it is rigid in the application of the law. All projects have to comply
by the environmental prerequisites - whether it be a channel, an
irrigation project or a tannery. <br>
      <br>
Not long ago the Environment Ministry, MARENA, shut down a tannery in
Granada. Now they are thinking about reopening but under strict
environmental conditions because they are situated close to the town of
Granada which is on the shore of Lake Nicaragua. We are protecting the
lake, because the lake is a source of fresh water in a world of water
shortages. And we have this important reservoir.<br>
      <br>
So investments and the environment must coexist. For us [protecting the
environment] is very important because it is the security of our future
generations that is at stake. In the case of mines or of any other kind
of investments we work to protect both the environment and also labour
rights. Nicaragua is lucky to have efficient workers and, of course,
labour rights must be respected. And we have commitments in this regard
with international conventions, as part of free trade agreements and as
part of other agreements we are negotiating - and ,of course, as part
of the government's philosophy on fair pay. <br>
      <br>
Talking about justice, we argue for production that takes into account
the Citizen Power Councils and we talk about fair prices for producers
and fair prices for consumers. It is not just a slogan. Effectively,
within the relations that we have established and that we engage in
continuously with all the different productive sectors - here in the
Ministry we meet everyday with different productive entities, with
small, medium and large representatives of the private sector - we use
different tools which allow us to follow a policy of fair prices for
the producer, tools derived from our foreign trade policy, for example.<br>
      <br>
Dialogue<br>
      <br>
We do not have a price fixing tool, because we do not believe that that
would resolve problems in the long term, but we do have tools like
policy management and dialogue. Dialogue is an important tool. When we
engage in dialogue with the producers, for example, we analyse the
specific situation of the line of produce they work in, where the
weaknesses are, what different sectors can contribute, what the private
sector can contribute, what the government can contribute. In that way
we reach a consensus about what we can do this year, what our
objectives are and what we can all contribute towards fulfilling those
objectives. We hold periodic meetings with different productive sectors.<br>
      <br>
TcS: Does this system of dialogue form part of the structure of Citizen Power?<br>
      <br>
OS: It is part of the structure of Citizen Power. I don't know if
everyone refers to it in that way. We call it Citizen Power. But I
don't know. We hold meetings and implement policies of support without
taking into account the political philosophy of the producers
concerned. So those who want to refer to this system as Citizen Power
do so, because that is the name of our model. But it could be referred
to as concertation - a private public concertation. <br>
      <br>
In reality, it is an articulation taking into account the concrete
tasks that should be carried out in different productive sectors, in
different productive activities. For example, we meet with the rice
producers, with exporters of beans, with producers of milk and cheese,
with small shoe manufacturers, with small bakers, with clothes
manufacturers. We meet with cattle farmers, with the slaughterhouse
industry, with representatives of the meat processers. And with each
different sector we arrive at a consensus. We take decisions about what
we are going to do this year. For example with vegetable producers.
This year we have been very active because we want this year to be an
extraordinary year in terms of production on all levels. <br>
      <br>
This government's policy is to promote production because we are
working towards not just food security but also towards what we call
food sovereignty. We are working towards producing all our own food.
And we have the potential to do it. The aim is that this country be
self sufficient in terms of food supply, and where possible to export
excess to other countries. We also look to export because we do not
envisage an isolated country. We envisage a country participating in
open international trade. Nicaragua is one of the most open countries
in the world in terms of international trade. <br>
      <br>
Regional relations <br>
      <br>
TcS: What level of coordination exists between you and your regional
colleagues? Do you enjoy good relations with Honduras and Panama, for
example, despite existing differences?<br>
      <br>
OS: We always have done so and now that we are in government we have
much more reason to do so. Perhaps you will remember that in the 80s
there was a war in Nicaragua, and also in El Salvador and in Guatemala.
And yet the Economy Ministers met to talk about integration and about
how we could take advantage of the opportunities that unity offered us.
      <br>
      <br>
So on the one hand there was war and severe political and military
tension between us, but on the other an integration process which, like
I explained at the beginning of the interview, we used as an instrument
of peace. So, yes there are political differences with our [Central
American] colleagues but we maintain relations with all the different
Economy Ministries. <br>
      <br>
Not long ago the Panamanian Economy Minister visited me here because
they had requested formal participation in the negotiation with the
European Union. <br>
      <br>
In terms of Honduras, well, we do not recognize the current Honduras
government. Different institutions and entities including the SICA
Presidential Council, the OAS, the Río Group and in Europe, the
European Union and European Commission, have passed resolutions stating
that they will not recognize any government derived from the coup
d'etat that took place in Honduras last year. <br>
      <br>
That is what has been resolved in those forums and so we have to wait
to see how these forums take it from here. We are not going to fail to
comply with decisions taken by the Presidential Council. Here, in
Managua, both the ALBA countries and the SICA Presidential Council met
and took decisions [regarding Honduras]. So if those decisions were
made by the Presidents then we must wait until the Presidents meet and
evaluate those decisions. We can't go ahead and change those decisions.
      <br>
      <br>
But what we can do - and this is a very important contribution that
President Daniel Ortega made not long ago - is to keep the economic and
commercial dynamic separate from the political dynamic. We are part of
a regional integration process, we are in negotiations with Europe.
And, although we cannot recognize the new Honduran government on a
political level until the Presidents take that relevant decision, we
can continue to coordinate general positions and negotiate economic and
commercial issues with Europe. Recent political events do not have to
affect the region's economy or regional commerce. President Ortega
clearly established that the dynamics should be treated separately,
that we should not allow the political situation to affect the economy,
trade or business in general.<br>
      <br>
TcS: In terms of regional trade that is encouraging ...<br>
      <br>
OS: It is very encouraging for the region and, what is more, I believe
that it is good news for the negotiation with Europe because they were
concerned about what would happen if the Central American countries
didn't recognize the Honduran government - a government derived from a
coup d'etat. <br>
      <br>
So, it is clear that what happens depends on the decision to be taken
by the Presidents. The different Central American Economic Ministers
are disciplined. If there is a presidential resolution that orders a
certain position, then we stand by that position. If that position is
changed, then we comply by that modification. But we cannot act without
a Presidential resolution. We cannot pursue a change that has not been
determined at the highest executive level.<br>
      <br>
TcS: Is it possible to say, therefore, that the decision to continue
negotiations regarding the economic aspects of the Association
Agreement with the European Union is dependent on a decision at the
highest level?<br>
      <br>
OS: It depends on the final definition of political relations, because
in economic terms the decision has already been taken. Our President
has been very clear, Nicaragua's position has already been defined by
the President. We cannot allow political phenomena to affect the
regional integration process, to affect trade within the region and
between the region and the rest of the world. <br>
      <br>
This position is more than justified, and it is not a new position for
Nicaragua which opted for the same position during the Revolution in
the 1980s. At that time there was a war, and at the same time there was
an economic and commercial integration process which was used as an
instrument of peace. <br>
      <br>
So we did that in the 1980s and we are doing the same thing again now
in the 21st century. It is a logical position which avoids undesired
political influences contaminating commercial and economic activity.<br>
      <br>
Zero Usury<br>
      <br>
TcS: Many US economic analysts have been predicting that employment
levels in the US will not recover until 2015 or even 2017. That implies
that the level of consumption in the US will remain low. If these
predictions turn out to be accurate, to what extent will that external
situation affect the development of MIFIC's policies here in Nicaragua?
      <br>
      <br>
OS: Naturally a low level of consumption in the US affects the level of
our exports to a certain extent. That's the way it works. If and when
the US economy is reactivated then our exports to the US market will
increase. <br>
      <br>
What we are doing here in Nicaragua, first of all, is strengthening our
internal market. Our internal market has been suppressed by poverty, by
the low income levels of our population. But as the population's income
increases the internal market is immediately stimulated. So what we are
trying to do is to reactivate our internal market.<br>
      <br>
We oversee a number of very important programs designed to reactivate
production. Perhaps you have heard of the program Zero Usury which is
administered by this ministry. This program involves 77,000 women,
representatives of 77,000 small businesses. For a country like
Nicaragua with a population of 5.5 million inhabitants, 77,000 is a
significant number of small businesses. <br>
      <br>
In this program low interest rate credits are provided. And those
benefited with credit take part in a training program before they
access the money. Every single women benefited (and only women are
benefited by this program) spend two days here in seminars learning
about small business. <br>
      <br>
They learn what income and expenditure are, what the main daily
accounts are. They learn about profit margins and about the objective
of their credit - to set up a business, to make that business viable
and to allow the original loan to be paid back. These concepts have
been passed on to the 77,000 women benefited by the program. And this
year the training workshops which are provided with the support of
INATEC [the National Technological Institute] are going to continue. <br>
      <br>
Since September 2007 this popular school of small business has trained
77,000 women. I don't know if there is another school in the world that
has trained the owners of 77,000 small businesses in the basic concepts
of business in such a short time. <br>
      <br>
And what has all this achieved? That the beneficiaries of the project
are able to make better use of their resources, that they understand
the importance of paying back the loan, in part so that they have the
option of taking out another loan and gradually allowing their business
to grow. It means that the default rate on the loans is low. In fact it
is lower than the default of private financing entities.<br>
      <br>
And the entire program takes place within a mechanism of solidarity.
Groups of five to ten women commit to covering their companions loan's
should one default. And that mechanism is used instead of guarantees in
this program. So the women benefited don't have to mortgage their
house. The guarantee is a social one. The guarantee is the commitment
of the groups involved. If one woman doesn't pay back the loan, she
does not have access to further loans - and neither do any of the other
women in their group. And of course that creates social pressure which
helps encourage people to keep up to date with their payments. And as a
result the program has a very low default rate. <br>
      <br>
So what is all this about? This is about strengthening small production and the internal market. <br>
      <br>
And simultaneously we are strengthening the regional market by
converting Nicaragua into a big exporter, mainly of agricultural
produce. Nicaragua is becoming Central America's main supplier of meat,
grains, beans. We are the main exporter of cheese and other dairy
products in Central America. <br>
      <br>
Another thing we are doing is opening new markets - with Venezuela, for
example, and with the other ALBA countries. We are participating in the
negotiation of a commercial agreement called the People's Trade
Agreement with the other ALBA countries in order to access these
markets. <br>
      <br>
Now 8% of our total exports go to Venezuela when just a couple of years
ago we hardly exported a thing to the country. And, if we comply by the
production and exportation program outlined with Venezuela, we should
be exporting approximately 15% of total exports to Venezuela this year.
That is similar to the proportion of our exports that goes to the
European Union.<br>
      <br>
SUCRE and ALBA <br>
      <br>
TcS: One detail, Minister - do you believe that the SUCRE will help to encourage inter-regional trade? <br>
      <br>
OS: Definitely. This program isn't based on magic, it is based on
method, it is scientific. The SUCRE is a system, a chamber of
compensation payments. The SUCRE begins life as a chamber of
compensation payments where countries make mutual loans to each other
calculated according to the level of trade. The trade is carried out.
And afterwards any outstanding balance between the countries is paid. <br>
      <br>
But this project is not just commercial. The commercial aspect goes
alongside programs to increase levels of production and exports in the
countries with weaker economies in order to ensure sufficient levels of
imports to make it possible to use the payment mechanisms. If it
weren't for that aspect of the project, it would not be possible for
the mutual loans to cover the cost of the commercial exchange between
countries - there would be a structural problem.<br>
      <br>
So, simultaneous with the SUCRE, [within ALBA] we are promoting
investment in countries with lower levels of development like
Nicaragua. That is why there are Venezuelan investments here. That is
why the construction of a petroleum refinery is possible in Nicaragua.
That is why we are able to guarantee low interest loans for
agricultural production in this country. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua has access to markets. We have increasing access to markets
with the Free Trade Agreements. Our weakness is in production. We have
enormous potential. It doesn't sound logical - if there is great
potential for production, then why don't we produce enough to fulfill
export objectives? What is missing? What is missing in Nicaragua is
capital. <br>
      <br>
Because we have workers, we have some of the most efficient and capable
agricultural producers is the world. In Nicaragua there are no
agricultural subsidies. Here the agricultural sector fends for itself.
In fact it does more than that - it sustains the rest of the economy.
Not like in other parts of the world where the rest of the economy
subsidizes and sustains the agricultural sector. That is why we are
against agricultural subsidies - we know that we can compete with the
rest of the world. We are poor but we are very efficient - with our
meat, our milk, our rice, our beans, our sugar.<br>
      <br>
And we produce certain industrially processed products that are among
the best in the world. For example the rum that we produce, we believe
it to be the best in the world. We produce tobacco, cigars that are
also the best in the world. We produce coffee - Nicaragua's quality
coffee is among the best in the world. We also have the world's best
cocoa. And we have more than enough land to produce and to export. So
we need to make an extraordinary effort to stimulate production in
order to take advantage of the markets available to us.<br>
      <br>
Going back to the SUCRE. It is not magic. The SUCRE is a mechanism that
has already been tried and tested in Central America. Remember that I
explained at the beginning of the interview that one of the first and
most advanced integration processes took place in Central America. <br>
      <br>
The first multilateral Central American Treaty, emerged in 1958, around
the same time as the Rome Treaty. And as part of that treaty, in
December 1960, the General Treaty of Economic Integration and an
agreement between the Central Banks to establish the Central American
Compensation Chamber were signed. In other words we are experienced in
the reality of compensation payment systems. <br>
      <br>
So when we talk about the SUCRE, it is not something new. Perhaps it is
a strange concept for certain people, but older people like myself who
have been working in this field for a long time have the certainty that
this sort of system is perfectly viable. It is a perfectly viable
compensation payments mechanism which is just beginning to operate. <br>
      <br>
And if, in the long term, we are going to develop this sort of trade
[within ALBA] we need to strengthen production in the countries that
are economically weaker in order to avoid imbalances. This contributes
to equality among countries. In other words ALBA functions based on the
principles of solidarity and equality between countries.<br>
