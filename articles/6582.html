<p>Gang member Cristhiam Josué Mendoza, alias ´VIPER´, Felix Maradiaga "The US government man", in the photo along with his far-right Colombian political ally Álvaro Uribe and Ricardo Baltodano, a member of the Sandinista Renewal Movement (MRS) party. It was this trio that principally made up the Central Command of the attempted coup d'état in Nicaragua after April 18th, 2018. The Command Center was the Polytechnic University of Managua, UPOLI.</p>

<p>Leonel Morales, student president of UPOLI, the Polytechnic University (Upoli) of Managua, recounts in this second installment how <strong>Cristhiam Josué Mendoza, alias ´VIPE</strong>R´ managed the gangs that kidnapped, tortured and murdered.</p>

<p><strong>Ricardo Baltodano</strong>, brother of the former Sandinista and commander <strong>Mónica Baltodano</strong> and member of the pro- yankee MRS party, was in charge of the political part.</p>

<p>"The US government man", <strong>Felix Maradiaga</strong> together with <strong>Luciano García</strong> from the <strong>NGO 'Hagamos Democracia'</strong> supported the group financially and that money was used to buy drugs, weapons and ammunition, as 'Viper' himself confessed in court.</p>

<p>This was the supposedly 'Peaceful' Terrorist Alliance  that operated a horror regime in the UPOLI, supported by the U.S.authorities,the Organzation of American States, the Latin American right wing, and the corporate media.</p>

<p>Leonel Morales was the student president in Upoli. And as student president, he directed programs assisting students, whether for scholastic supplies, soem economic assistance, or social projects.<br />
 <br />
"During my period in the UPOLI, I carried out activities to help an old people's home and a children's shelter. Those were projects that I did. The UPOLI at that time on April 18th (2018), a group of students were badly advised by the Dean of the UPOLI Law School, Oscar Castillo. He sent his people to outside to protest for another purpose to had nothing to do with defending the elderly. But that was the excuse that Dean used to send them out to protest.<br />
 <br />
That was when a lot of people joined, because Upoli is surrounded by neighborhoods like Georgino Andrade, Villa Progreso, Villa Rafael Herrera and took over the university.<br />
 <br />
But he stresses that it was not UPOLI students, but people from outside the university like gang members, vagrants, all kinds of criminals. They controlled among themselves everything that happened to people inside the university.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Some of the victims of the terrorism that was planned from the Upoli.</em></p>

<p>"Very often, even at the time they were first about to kidnap me, people when they were caught were taken to the university and tortured. They invented a lot of deaths blaming them on the police but they were the ones who were killing each other inside the university.</p>

<p><strong>Viper and the gang members</strong><br />
 <br />
A corpulent young man called Cristhiam Josué Mendoza, a.k.a. VIPER, was known as one of the leaders operating inside the Upoli. In the trial against 'Viper' he himself confessed to almost all of his crimes resulting in his 90 year prison sentence. But since the maximum sentence in Nicaragua is 30 years, the judge gave him that sentence.<br />
 <br />
"The truth is that that boy the Viper was the one who had command and control of the whole university and of all the delinquents".</p>

<strong> The ex-Sandinista traitor</strong><br />
 <br />
UPOLI was also home to Ricardo Baltodano, brother of the ex-Sandinista and Comandante Monica Baltodano. Ricardo Baltodano was leader of the Sandinista Renewal Movement (MRS) party, and union leader of the teachers. Ricardo Baltodano, according to Leonel Moreno, oriented and directed the gang members politically.</p>

<em>He no longer carries the red and black flag,<br />
of Sandinismo, Ricardo Baltodano</em></div>

<div>"Ricardo Baltodano was the leader of the workers internally in the UPOLI. He himself also entered the university and took part in this coup. Because he too also had control managing what was happening inside and outside the university".<br />
<br />
Morales says Baltodano knew what was going on and supported it. He never, Morales adds, called for peace, or calm.<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : "He chose not to leave the university or tell the workers and the university teachers 'No, that's not a struggle but rather that what' are happening are murders!' There were all kinds of things they were doing. He just stood there at the university acting."<br />
 <br />
Dick Emanuelsson : Giving political orientation to the people?<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : "Giving political orientation, telling them what they could do, who they could kidnap and then how they tortured them once inside."<br />
 <br />
Ricardo Baltodano : Did he see all that?<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : "He saw all that.  He's one of the people who was leading, running things internally at the university.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Defeated in the 1994 FSLN Congres</strong>s<br />
 <br />
Ricardo Baltodano is an ex-Sandinista who participated in the insurrection in León and in the liberation of León in 1978 and 1979. He was one of the people who did an about face in 1994 in the Congress of the Sandinista Front, where most of the leadership of the FSLN, former ministers and comandantes (except principally Tomas Borge and Daniel Ortega) wanted to abandon revolutionary and Marxist principles in order to take a social democratic line.<br />
 <br />
With the Sandinista defeat in the 1990 elections and the collapse of the socialist camp and the USSR, the outlook looked rather dark. But Ortega, Borge and several other commanders, backed by the Sandinista Youth, did not want to throw in the towel and the vast majority of the delegates at the FSLN congress in 1994 voted decisively to maintain the Sandinista Front as the vanguard of the Sandinista People.

<em>A new generation of Sandinistas who won't surrender to the Empire. PHOTO: JAIRO CAJINA.</em></p>

<p>The traitors to Sandino and the historic founders of the Sandinista Liberation Front (FSLN) all chose to create their own NGOs and to found the MRS as a façade with the fairytale that they were still `sandinistas´, but not quite so much as before. As a reward for the maneuvers to divide the FSLN, donations began to flow from the Empire "the enemy of Humanity," as Carlos Mejía Godoy sang in the decade of the 70´-80´ when the Empire mined to the port of Corinto, armed an entire army of 25,000 mercenaries to physically exterminate the Revolution and the civilian population. But now Godoy has chosen the Empire as his ally with the single obsessive task of destroying the FSLN.<br />
 <br />
The same thing happened with Ricardo Baltodano. The interesting thing about the confessions of the gang member `VIPER´ is that he unmasks the intellectual authors of the attempted coup in Nicaragua. He points to the MRS, who allied with Viper and the gang members  and financed them indirectly via the ONG world which receives its dollars from the different "civil" agencies of the CIA such as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Intenational Republican Institute (IRI) or the National Democratic Institute (NDI).</p>

<p><strong>Felix and "the King of Synthetic Coca".</strong><br />
 <br />
During Viper's trial, he stated that Felix Maradiaga was one of the suppliers of money and weapons. Félix Maradiaga Blandón himself can be seen in a video taken in the UPOLI on the second day of the protests with a 9 mm Clock pistol (worth 650 dollars).<br />
<br />
This individual began in the Liberal Party Youth and sereved in the Liberal government of Enrique Bolaños as Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense. He is a US government man, financed with around a million dollars over the last five or six years. His Institute of Strategic Studies and Public Policy (IEEPP) NGO received US$153,659 in 2018 from the NED, the 'civil' facade of the CIA.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>The `TSAR of the COCAINE ROSADA´, that is to say the synthetic coca, the Colombian capo<br />
Julio César Paz Varela had "buisness" with the US government man in Nicaragua, Félix Maradiag</em>a.</p>

<p>Under Maradiaga's leadership IEEPP  signed a contract in 2011 with the Tsar of Pink Cocaine, that is to say synthetic coca. The Colombian capo was Julio César Paz Varela, who was killed in 2014. This individual was supposedly bringing young people from Colombia to Nicaragua for rehabilitation when in reality he was building up his drug sales network.<br />
<br />
Félix Maradiaga moved in this sector and environment in recent years, financed by the Americans and doing business with a Colombian capo.<br />
 <br />
So it was not strange that Felix Maradiaga entered and supplied the gang members in the UPOLI with food and money, exchanging strategy policies with political mentor Ricardo Baltodano.<br />
 <br />
But in the UPOLI video, Felix Maradiaga says,  <em>"To people listening to this message: don't forget the young people, the women, the men who are still unjustly detained! It is important that citizens speak out."</em><br />
 <br />
<em><strong>What were Moisés Hassan and Hugo Torres (former Sandinista Comandantes) doing in Upoli?</strong></em><br />
 <br />
<em>"We have succeeded in establishing the existence of criminal structures organized by the person known as Felix Maradiaga in conjunction with the criminal group Viper,"</em> said Police Commissioner General Luis Perez.<br />
 <br />
And Viper himself states clearly in the video,  <em>"In Upoli, individuals like Moisés Hassan showed up, Hugo Torres showed up, and they talked with me, giving support foreverything the protest needed... Later Félix Maradiaga was there along with Orellana. Even Luciano García was funding a group in which was used to buy drugs, weapons and ammunition." (Luciano Garcia leads Hagamos Democracia, financed by NED with US$75,000 a year) </em></p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em>Two ex-Sandinistas who moved to the "other side."</em></p>

<p>Leonel Morales agrees, "<em>This person and Professor Ricardo Baltodano had everything well organized. That was the moment they exploited so as to overthrow the government, a moment where they sought to take advantage along with Oscar Castillo, Dean of the Law School...  Félix Maradiaga often arrived with trucks at the university bringing supplies. Because that's what they managed there, the economic resources. Often on the social networks they published videos showing Félix Maradiaga with a gun, and Professor Ricardo Baltodano also appeared. All this had its origins, supported by the United States. It was a blow one did not expect. But today we are calm, thanks to Comandante Ortega's planning. But at that time, from April [2018] onwards, there was an atmosphere of tension and fear, an atmosphere of insecurity."</em><br />
 <br />
<strong>Felix and Nikki at the UN</strong><br />
 <br />
As the confirmation of who pulls on the strings of the coup attempt, one day Maradiaga sat at the United Nations Security Council, invited by Nikki Haley, rabid anti-Communist and anti-Sandinista , then ambassador of Donald Trump at the UN, to talk about how university students, students and the people of Nicaragua were and are being repressed by "a fierce dictatorship, which is the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega". Nobody noted that people wanted to lynch Maradiaga himself, when he arrived in León after the coup's bubble had already burst and he 'd gone into exile in the United States.</p>

<em>The seat on the UN Security Council of the rabid warrior Nikki Haley was handed over to one of the intellectual authors of the<br />
human rights violations and instigators of the "soft" coup d'etat in Nicaragua. In 2018 alone, his NGO received<br />
a US contribution of $154,000, equivalent to 83.3 years of minimum wages for a public worker in Nicaragua.</em></p>

<p>What strikes a foreign observer of last year's political conflict in Nicaragua, prompts the question: How was it possible that the coup plotters in teh blink of an eye managed to make their coup attempt, raising a hundred barricades overnight? How was it possible that the powerful student movement had not noticed the gringos were training more than 5,000 young Nicaraguan university students from 2013 onwards, who also received scholarships on how to operate the technology of the social networks? How was it possible, as the North American journalist Max Blumenthal notes, that five thousand Nicaraguan youths funded from the United States were the cadres and social communicators of that coup attempt?</p>

<p>Leonel Morales answers, "They organized it very well. The U.S. financially financed the leading figures here,  Felix Maradiaga, and other people. And what were they doing? Because the people  operating the barricades weren't students, they were gang members. They were people who had come out of Tipitapa's El Modelo prison. There were all kinds of people, except university students. They got involved because those leading figures had the economic resources to pay delinuqents to create chaos. Because they were being paid and supported with all kinds of supplies, they did what they always do, crating a swamp, causing chaos for everyone in Nicaragua, such that no citizen could travel in peace along the highways...<br />
 <br />
"In every barricade blocking the roads, people were asked tpo pay money and if it didn't happen, if they didnt pay the money they were threatened. It was a period in which everyone was afraid. The places where the gangs concentrated were the universities. From there they had control of everything, from there they organized the coup, they did the killing, the kidnappings. The way they killed and burned many police officers is especially painful."<br />

<strong>The UCA was a center of Fakenews and terror</strong><br />
 <br />
The Central American University, UCA, was actually a terrorist center and it is also possible to denounce them  as among the intellectual authors of the 2018 'soft coup'.<br />
<br />
At the UCA, the Psychological War began with accusations that the national police murdered a student. It was April 17, 2018, a day BEFORE the coup offensive to overthrow the Sandinista government began.<br />
<br />
The owners of the extremely well-resourced UCA are The Company of Jesus, commonly known as Jesuits, a religious order of regular clergy of the Catholic Church founded in 1534 by Spaniard Ignacio de Loyola. It is the largest Catholic religious order today, according to Wikipedia.<br />
 <br />
In Nicaragua, we learned there are concerns among the UCA management that the subsidy to this university for the rich will be reduced by 25 percent. We asked Leonel Morales to tell us and explain about the reform and student struggle of the '6%' of the government's education budget:<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : The UCA was the initial center of the protests because they set out to create an atmosphere of anxiety on April 17th.<br />
 <br />
Dick Emanuelsson : A day before the protests?<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : Exactly. They themselves created chaos on the night of April 17 when they deliberatly misinformed the general public, alleging the police had killed a student at the UCA. There was never a student killed at the UCA. From there all the chaos began. Groups took to the streets to protest and then say that the government was killing them. But that was all led by people like Ricardo Baltodano, Dean Oscar Castillo, Felix Maradiaga, Monica Baltodano and the others. Also by the Rector of the UCA. That's when the students got involved, there was no important issue they were protesting."<br />
 <br />
<strong>A class at the Jesuit UCA costs US$90!</strong><br />
 <br />
The coup plotters acted with great professionalism, manipulating "the first death" from the UCA, as Morales says. The truth is that the first three dead were not opponents, but a supermarket worker, a young man from the Juventud Sandinista and a policeman.<br />
 <br />
<strong>The Sandinista government introduced the "6%".  </strong></p>

<p>It is difficult to understand why a university so luxurious for the children of wealthy people will benefit from the state subsidy. During the three Liberal party governments (1990-2006) the student struggle, backed by the FSLN, was very hard. It was when the Sandinistas won that Daniel Ortega's government introduced the "6%" to all of the universities for the first time.<br />
 <br />
The tariffs to be able to study in the university of the Jesuits, say the priests of the poor. But studying at the UCA is for the children of parents from the upper-middle class and above.<br />
<br />
<strong>How is it possible that the state subsidizes a private for-profit university?</strong><br />
 <br />
LeonelMorales : "The President has supported all the citizens, all the Nicaraguan people. He has taken care of his people and he has tken care of students. The UCA is a purely private university. Because it is a university it receives 6%, but they charge per class,  a single class in the UCA costs US$90!"<br />
 <br />
Dick Emanuelsson : A single semester class?</p>

<p>Leonel Morales : "US$90. US$90 for a single class in the UCA. In the UPOLI, the UPOLI is private but with a public service. In UPOLI the monthly fee is US$45. That monthly fee includes all six classes per semester. In other words, US$45 dollars is paid monthly, but the students take their six classes as usual without additional payment. Nothing like the UCA, where each class cost US$90. They take six classes each semester and have to pay US$90 a month!<br />
 <br />
Dick Emanuelsson : US$540 has to be paid by the students at the UCA for four months!<br />
 <br />
 Lenoel Morales : It's unreal.<br />
 <br />
Dick Emanuelsson :  It mus be equal to something like three minimum wages.<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : Exactly. However, Comandante Ortega has looked at this and he has encourage all the universities to make sure that ordianry students can get their first degree. He has guaranteed the education budget so the National Council of Universities (CNU) can distribute it to each university and for the Rectors to use. The UCA enjoys those benefits but in the UCA there is no effective student leadership, there is no leadership or structure to see if the fundingfor students are well-controlled and well-managed. In the UCA there is no such thing. At the UCA you can't say 'Out with th epresident!'. Here in the UPOLI, students are helped here. We run all kinds of social and economic programs. Here we give scholarship programs to the students. But that's not a reality at the UCA, honestly.<br />
 <br />
Dick Emanuelsson: Because the Congress of the National Union of Nicaraguan Students (UNEN) said a few months ago that the 6% would then be cut to the UCA. They reduced the 6% by 25 per cent as I understand it, from what the UCA received in their 2017 budget.<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : Exactly. Some people went out to protest, like the UCA students. They said the government was taking 6% away from them. It's not as simple as that. The 6% was cut because no one has control over student resources. Because the 6% is for the UCA students. But the UCA management just present a single program and that program supposedly subsumes the resources intended for the students. But that's not true. The request from UNEN, the National Union of Nicaraguan Students, was only for  a reduction [to the UCA], nothing more...<br />
 <br />
Because in reality those who go to the UCA to study are people, students, children of businessmen, children of citizens who are economically well off, who have businesses. They are the children of the well-to-do.<br />
 <br />
But that doesn't mean theycan't help other people too. Because there are people at the UCA, let's talk about 100 percent, maybe 5% are students who really need it. It's not like other universities, like UNAN or UNI whose students don't have the economic resources, they don't have the economic resources to be paying 45, 80 or 90 dollars per month for a single class.</p>

<p>Dick Emanuelsson :  Are you going to join your classes again?<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : The semester started in November last year and I couldn't attend class because I was still recovering. Now I'm going to work more with the President because he's the only person who really cares about the needs of the Nicaraguan people. Leonel Morales will be around for a while.<br />
 <br />
Dick Emanuelsson : Your attackers, have they captured them, have they sentenced them? Do we know who they are?<br />
 <br />
Leonel Morales : The police know who they are, because they were 30 people who arrived armed. The police know who they are, they all fled. They are already in Costa Rica, others in Panama. I think they've captured two people, that's all. But the others fled...  I can tell you that the police will do justice so that what they did to me doesn't happen to someone else. Because that was something completely inhuman and God forgive them.<br />
 <br />
<strong>NOTE : The fees to study at the UCA</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>On its fees, the UCA website informs what students pay in the different careers. It ranges between US$80-110 per subject/class per term and they have to take 4-5 classes.</li>
	<li>The average semester is US$320-550. Annually it is between US$640-1100.</li>
	<li>The US$1100 of the total cost of the quarter is equivalent to seven (7) minimum wages for public workers, municipality, government (US$157), while workers in the sectors of electricity and water; Commerce, Restaurants and Hotels; Transportation, Storage and Communications, who earn US$230 monthly have to work 4.8 months to be able to study but without eating or have other expenses.</li>
	<li>The UCA is not a university of the poor. Source : <a href="https://www.uca.edu.ni/images/pregrado/pdf/visor/web/Oferta-Academica-UCA-Grado-2019.pdf">https://www.uca.edu.ni/images/pregrado/pdf/visor/web/Oferta-Academica-U…</a></li>
