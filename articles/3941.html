<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We wanted to talk with Dr. Carlos Arguello this morning, about this 40th Anniversary that takes on a singular importance, as Dr. Carlos Arguello already said yesterday, due to the fact that Nicaragua is also at the International Court of Justice indicting Germany for genocide, for accompanying Israel in the genocide against the Palestinian people. We'll talk to him in a few moments.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I'll start with William who is here with us. William, we are talking about 40 years of that Historic Lawsuit, I was looking at the allegations in many of accusations made against the United States on April 9th 1984. The Court admitted the case, although the United States did its usual tricks to avoid and evade responsibility but in the end had to face the culmination with the Court’s Sentence. What do you think after 40 years of this historic action? What thoughts can you offer after 40 years, Brother. You who lived through that event, you were young and we were in the middle of a Revolution. Two things, I would argue, Nicaragua defending its Sovereignty, Nicaragua defending its Right to Self-determination and Nicaragua, the Sandinista Popular Revolution, going to the International Court of Justice, as we have continued to do. Welcome William.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Journalist William Grigsby</b></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Thank you very much for the invitation, greetings to all our compañeras and compañeros. I think it is important to remember the context in which it happened, both nationally and internationally. We filed this lawsuit in 1984, and we have already had about a year and a half of war, even more of covert actions, not so open but terrorist, blowing up bridges, mining ports, murdering people.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That is, there was a context in which Nicaragua’s Youth launched themselves to defend the Homeland, remember that at that time it was voluntary and the young people of the Sandinista Youth and in general, from the urban neighborhoods, from the rural communities, launched themselves to defend the Nation, going to the mountains.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Let's remember another part of the context, the Argentine, Honduran, Brazilian, Salvadoran and gringo military advisers, forming the “Contra” in the south of Honduras. Let us also remember that in that year of '84, a little earlier, another force of the “Contra” was formed in the south of Nicaragua, with the idea of suffocating us.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's the context, but also the US Congress was openly discussing how many millions they were giving to kill Nicaraguans. In this context, Nicaragua makes the decision that is a historic decision. Just filing a lawsuit implied enormous courage on the part of Nicaragua, of the Nicaraguan people, which matched the courage of the People and the country’s Youth, defending the Nation on the battlefield.<br />

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Doctor, what reflections can you make after 40 years of the filing of that Lawsuit? A small country like Nicaragua, I said it at the beginning, against a giant like the United States; an aggressor, an imperialist giant, with an interventionist policy, which had already invaded us a thousand times, not a thousand times, I'm exaggerating, a lot of times, and well, it was causing damage to us, killing, murdering openly.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">What reflection can you make after 40 years of this historic Lawsuit before the International Court of Justice in The Hague? I was telling Chele Grigsby that we could highlight two things: One, the fact that Nicaragua is always defending its Sovereignty, the Right to Self-determination, and also going to the International Courts of Justice to settle these issues. And the United States going crazy, as always, you mentioned it yesterday, so as not to assume responsibilities.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Welcome, Doctor, we would like a reflection after 40 years.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Thank you very much, Alberto, for having invited me to remind us of this very important moment. As William Grigsby was saying a moment ago, actually the context in which this situation took place is the most important thing.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That is, the idea of going to court was already in hand; probably, we had been turning that possibility over for more than a year. A series of things happened in 1983, I think it was in September, October, the US invasion of the Island of Grenada, which was a first taste, let's say, of threats to us, the whole war was already coming against us. The attack came to Corinto and they mercilessly set fire to the gasoline tanks and all the fuel tanks that were there, endangering the 20,000 inhabitants at that time, without any mercy.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">All these things were happening when the decision was made that the time had come to go to court. William pointed out this, this context, because many times, throughout all these years people ask: Whose idea was it? As if the simple idea had been, let's say, the success of this matter. This is a matter that has been studied and consulted.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">It was consulted, everywhere in the world it was consulted before doing so, this aggression against Nicaragua was coming to a crescendo and, obviously, as a lawyer, among the options we had was this appeal to the Court, but the important point was, that there were political minds behind this, that they were analyzing and that they made the decision to proceed.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And it was carried out at exactly the moment when it was most important internationally and where this issue had the most impact. Because, one thing that we cannot forget is that, among the most important cases and many say that it is perhaps the most important that has been deliberated on by the Court, this case has been ours.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">This is a case that all international law students have been studying for almost 40 years; that is, it is one of the most famous cases, certainly, indisputably, and it is due to what was happening in Nicaragua, the moment and the way in which it chose to act, and all the actions that were taken.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I think that what needs to be remembered, and frankly yesterday when we were initiating the case of these appeals against Germany for its support and complicity with Israel in the destruction of the Palestinian People, I was precisely remembering and I mentioned in Court, the fact that we had 40 years of having initiated this case against the United States and 40 years later we were still in the struggle, and that the stone we had cast 40 years ago we were still throwing now in favor of the Palestinian People, of our Palestinian Brothers and Sisters.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That is to say, it is a case that has had a huge echo throughout the history of these 40 years, and like all of us who participated in this, it gives me great pride, great satisfaction every time I remember, to have had this privilege that the Revolution gave me, to have participated in this issue so important for all of us, and for humanity.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And I say humanity, because precisely this was not an isolated issue for Nicaragua, it is an issue that we continue to repeat and use, right now, in favor of our Palestinian Brothers and Sisters; but it is a resource that Nicaragua opened and that is there to serve Humanity.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
So it was a task and that is why it seems to me that it is very important that we do not forget about it, especially the young people who are listening or who may be listening to this, so they realize what it is about, that it was not a simple matter that was taken to a court or that a letter was sent and that something happened. It was an event that was well studied, which took a long time to prepare, and that it was a heroic deed within the area, obviously of law that we are discussing, within the many heroic deeds happening at that time in Nicaragua, and which continue to happen, to one extent or another, in our day too.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But anyway, again thank you very much Alberto, thank you all very much, and I am attentive to hearing your comments here, and if I can perhaps serve as to amplify something, or remember, or use my memory to recall some event, with pleasure I am here ready to participate.</p>

Doctor, I remember that a couple of days before, or the day before Nicaragua filed the lawsuit, the United States decided to withdraw, that is, to ignore the jurisdiction of the Court, when it had already recognized it since 1946, if I remember correctly. And I think Nicaragua was planning to file the lawsuit on the 11th and not on the 9th. Can you remember the details of what happened then?</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Yes. What a great memory, you have! Indeed, it was one of the things or matters of interest that the gringos with their espionage system were well aware of, knowing exactly in detail everything we were doing. Imagine, we are talking about 40 years ago, so now with the espionage systems they have it must be worse. If ten years ago, talking about Germany now, ten or twelve years ago they were eavesdropping the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, listening to her phone, the gringos listening to the phone of the Chancellor, their German ally.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But anyway, what I recall is very true. I remember that it was on a Friday that the United States presented at the United Nations the Note from the United States Secretary of State, in which they said that they were going to suspend knowledge and acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Court for a period of 5 years in everything related to Central America.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I remember we were notified, that this Note was submitted on Friday afternoon, and it was already night time on Friday in Holland when they notify us and, indeed, we were going to file the matter on Wednesday the 11th, but as that notice had arrived that they had sent that Note we decided to go immediately, and on Monday we immediately asked for the Court appointment and went to file the Lawsuit.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Of course. According to what we were able to gather, it was the notorious George Shultz, and it was on April 6, 1984, when he said verbatim: “The aforementioned declaration should not be applied to disputes with any Central American State or that originate or are related to events unfolding in Central America; these disputes will be settled (as you are explaining) in the way that the Parties to the disputes in question agree.”</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The moment in which this Demand was initiated, we are talking about 40 years ago, 1984, a historical moment for humanity and especially in Latin America, in which the United States, as you said, had recently just carried out the invasion of the island of Grenada.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The United States was used to doing whatever it wanted practically, and they arrogated to themselves that right. 40 years later, Doctor, how much has this changed, and especially the legal implication that this Demand by Nicaragua has meant over time?</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Among the things that have changed and that we have seen the change, not for the better, it is simply a change, if before the ways of attacking us had been through the creation of the Contras and the armed attacks on Nicaragua, and that was the basis of the trial. What we experienced in Nicaragua in 2018, sponsored by the United States, was another type of use of the system of destroying a government or attempting the destruction of a government in a more subtle and more indirect way.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Unfortunately, seen from this point of view, the United States learned the lesson of trying to do things in a different way, which is what they tried to do with us.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">What they were doing in 1984 was what they had always been doing in all our countries. How many times have the Marines invaded Nicaragua? That is to say, in Nicaragua we have a history of invasions, and in all of Our America, especially in Our Caribbean-America, well, how many invasions by the United States had there not been…</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That, let's say, was the last provocation they had on the island of Grenada, which was a use of force, first, to compensate for a disaster that had happened to them precisely in the Middle East, that some bombs had exploded and killed I think they were 200 or 300 American Marines who were stationed in Lebanon.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">After that disaster that killed a lot, then after 2 months President Reagan decided to invade Grenada, as if he was invading the Soviet Union, at that time; the great invasion to a small island with a population of less than 100,000 inhabitants at that time; of which they even made a movie as if it had been a great historical episode.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But it also served, at that time, as a threat to Nicaragua, because obviously in the midst of all the attacks that were directed at Nicaragua, then it was a matter of wiping the record of what had happened to them there and serving as a threat against us.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So for us, to resort to the Court was to try to put a stop to this policy of aggression, open and brazen of the United States, as if it could be invading our Countries as if they were, in fact, part of the backyard of their house.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
And I think what was shown in the Court was, first of all, that we demanded respect, not only for the way we were defending ourselves in Nicaragua with all the boys sacrificing their lives and all the misfortunes we suffered, but also with the full force of the law.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I think that this lesson, as I say, is so great that it is still leading the way and right now, today, 40 years later, this case that we are seeing, that of Nicaragua against Germany, is for me frankly a continuation of all the legal action that Nicaragua has had in defense of the Right of Peoples to Non-Intervention.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">What is being done particularly through the People President media outlets, is to put in context such a memorable, historical date, (...) that marks the introduction of that Lawsuit against the United States at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, one fully supported given the aggression in that context against our Country, as already clearly expressed by Dr. Carlos Argüello, whose work we must recognize on behalf of our Country in that immense arena of International Justice and International Law.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But, naturally, I want to ask Dr. Argüello, what Nicaragua was able to achieve from the position it reached at the International Court of Justice, 40 years later, after that important Ruling in our favor, what did it mean for other Peoples, because that initiative, that accusation, at that time, for many Countries, for a great many who were watching us (...), many considered this to be a mere adventure, something impossible, but in the end, it was achieved.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Today, after that step taken by Nicaragua, other peoples who have been attacked have an opening, the only one, to appeal and accuse, although in terms of jurisdiction the United States says that The Hague has no jurisdiction.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I really believe that we achieved that and the step we took 40 years ago is a step that has opened the door, has opened the eyes of all the Countries of the world, that there are other resources too, that the Law is one of the main defenses that weak Countries have. Because in the past, the United States boasted as if they had a monopoly on virtue, that they were a Country with the entire Judicial System, with everything the most perfect; and that, in fact, was a bluff; that is, they accepted the Law as long as it suited its interests.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The United States and maybe I deviate a little from the topic, but at that point speaking out loud and forgive me because we old people have our memory sometimes that interferes with what we are talking about; but on that issue of disrespect for the Law, I would like to make a comment.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
In 1979, 80, I was in charge, it was not publicly (...) but it was part of my responsibility, to try to put into practice an extradition treaty that we had with the United States that had been signed in 1907. Then, I remember that we went to the United States, the State Department told us: This whole matter can be processed here, and once it is ready, that you present all the evidence to us, then the process takes place.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So that's how we proceeded, we spent a year presenting all the evidence; when we had everything ready, then we said: Well, we're going to proceed to ask for their extradition. We asked for the extradition and, of course, from there the game started.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Obviously, the Extradition Treaty was null and void. The Treaty that existed, had been in existence for 70 years, the United States simply did not comply with it. So the Law for the United States has been non-existent. They boast that it is a country that respects the law, and that is not true. We've seen it.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That is, when we went to Court and went to Court in this case, the United States stopped going to Court, and told the Court to go to hell, even though there was an International Agreement that obliged them to go to Court; that is, they disrespected the Court. In other words, the United States has never respected the Law when they are not interested in it.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Moreover, perhaps deviating even more, going simply to the region we are talking about, we could remember this, that an Agreement with Iran had been signed 6 years ago, 7 years ago, an Agreement with Iran that was signed by European Countries and the United States. When Trump came up he said: This is not worth anything! and he simply unilaterally ignored what they had signed. This is a small detour, but my point is that the United States has never respected the law.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Then, by taking them to the International Court, we highlighted the importance for small countries like Nicaragua, and for the whole world, of making use of the law. And also to put in evidence, that the United States was false in claiming that it respected the Law, that it was not reasons of justification of Law that drove its policy, but strictly its economic and monopolistic interests. That's what we proved and that has been in evidence all this time.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I would like to return to the topic of International Law because, in reality, a small Country like Nicaragua, like us, having the courage and bravery to take the United States to the Highest Court of Justice of the United Nations for a war of aggression, because the United States created the Contras to attack Nicaragua and caused us so much harm, so many deaths, also violating International law, and the Court determined that Sovereignty should be respected and also Non Intervention in the internal affairs of Countries, that is a huge precedent that remained for history. I would like your comments.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Thank you very much. Starting with the issue of Sanctions, which is precisely one of the things in this issue of Palestine and in this Lawsuit against Germany; that is, one of the things that drive us and me personally, is that these Countries like Germany, which dare to go around putting sanctions on everyone, from the moral high ground, like the United States, “defending the law,” and we are going to sanction so-and-so, or we are going to sanction another; but now they are seeing that the destruction and killing and massacre of the entire Palestinian People, they continue to support Israel. Where are the sanctions?</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">As I mentioned yesterday, as regards the United Nations Refugee Organization, the UNRWA as they call it, Israel in January said that 6 or 12 of the officials employed by that Organization were involved in the events of October 7th that started the attack against some Israelis, which caused or gave an excuse to start this.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, immediately Germany ordered cancellation of the aid to Palestine given by this Organization, which is a United Nations Organization, because Israel said that 6 or 12 officials, out of the 12,000 or 15,000 who work, were involved. Without proof, to this day they have not proven anything, but they went and canceled it immediately.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's why I told them yesterday, with the words of Israel alone, they canceled it, but with everything that all of humanity is saying, from the Secretary General of the United Nations, and the Red Cross, everyone, everything that is happening in Palestine, what Israel is doing, the genocide that they are committing, and they continue to help him. They don't pay attention to that.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Where is the moral authority? Where is the respect for the law, of what they are doing with these Sanctions? How was that Refugee Organization sanctioned? By simply suspending aid to this United Nations Refugee Agency. So these sanctions are simply political decisions that use to try and dress up as Law.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Now, what they did to us in 2018 is obviously ironic. I was reading media from that time, in which there are interviews with some of these people who were involved, and they were talking to them and they say: Well, yes, until 2018 everything was fine; if it hadn't been for what they did and then things got bad.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That brings to mind, I remember, an interview which Don Enrique Bolaños, the former President, had given, I don't have the date very precisely, when he had been invited by a group of the most important businessmen of Central America, and had met with them. Later Don Enrique gave some statements, that he had really disliked the meeting because at that meeting all the businessmen were praising the way President Ortega was handling things in Nicaragua.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And precisely that management that was being carried out is what had been irritating the United States, which since then, long before anything happened in 2018, they were already trying to impose sanctions on us. Because it was not even in the time of Trump, but already in Obama’s time when, Congress had already approved Sanctions against Nicaragua, when nothing had happened, until that moment, of the later events that they themselves sponsored.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, simply none of those were moral or legal reasons to impose sanctions, they were simply political decisions, based on their interests: We are going to sanction this Country because it is not with us, period, or because we are don’t like this government. But there is nothing of law or morality behind any of this. All that is a falsehood.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The thing is that as regards the Court's judgments, the only power able to impose them by force, has to be through the United Nations Security Council. When the sentence came, we even appealed to the Security Council, and what happened? The United States applied its veto, which is one of the ironic things about the International Legal System as it stands, that the Country sanctioned opted for its Right to a veto to avoid that sanction being imposed on it.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The situation is that the Court ordered that the United States has to indemnify Nicaragua, and that compensation remains in force, it is a historical obligation that exists on the part of the United States and it is a historical Right which Nicaragua has not renounced.</p>

I would like to ask you about some aspects having to do with what was done at that time, because it was a titanic work and it was established, according to historical documents, for March 29, 1988, that Nicaragua would present the damages for which the United States had to respond.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">There is another amount of millions for the loss of production, for damages caused by direct attacks by the United States including mines of ports, for Defense and Security expenses, for damages derived from the trade embargo, for damages caused to the development potential, for damages caused to social development, for reparation for the attacks against sovereignty, for reparation for moral damages.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Yes, indeed, Alberto. That was another job within the legal framework, within the work, and if you want of administration, to prepare that Report, to quantify the damages caused to Nicaragua. There was a team there that worked, involved a number of Nicaraguan institutions, as I am not a specialist in that field, that was mainly coordinated by Dr. Paul Oquist who was a brilliant man; he was in charge of preparing everything, collecting all those elements that finally added up in that way...</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Naturally, with the team of lawyers, we were all reviewing and seeing all the documents, but obviously in order to do all the assessments of the damages caused, specialists were needed in those matters, and everything was calculated in the best possible way and was presented.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The issue of whether it was US$12,000 million or US$17,000 million, also depends on the timing, because obviously in terms of money, a debt of one million dollars 100 years ago is not the same as a debt of one million dollars today; obviously the monetary value changes.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In addition, this was not a total evaluation, this is simply what had been done up to that moment; the war ended, we were making a calculation in memory, I do not remember until what date it had been done (...) later the amount would have been above the then $17,000 million. Obviously now the equivalent would be a much larger amount.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Just to comment Doctor, remembering what happened, I would say that there are at least five political victories that the People of Nicaragua obtained, let's remember that it is the People of Nicaragua, it is not the supreme figure of the State, it is the Nicaraguan people who were with their blood defending the Nation, and a group of jurists headed by Doctor Argüello, accompanied that sacrifice and presented this Demand. But I would say, first, the very fact of filing the Lawsuit is a Victory; secondly, the fact that the United States did not recognize the jurisdiction of the Court, and the scandal that meant because it was a global scandal, I remember that, is another Victory. I mean, they said, that by doing so they were going to avoid this problem and it was exactly the other way around.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Thirdly, I remember that just as the Precautionary Measures are being requested right now on the case of Germany, Nicaragua requested the Precautionary Measures and it was unanimous that they were granted to Nicaragua, another great victory that was to suspend aid to the counterrevolution at that time. The fourth is when the judgment itself, on June 27, 1986, and well, then the compensation, the amount of compensation that was already in 1988. In other words, Nicaragua won a victory on all sides. And I loved that quote from Doctor Arguello, what an astute thing to say! It is the same stone of Andres that achieved this Victory in The Hague; it is a beautiful phrase. And also it seems to me, it synthesizes what happened there.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">It is interesting to remember that point of the mining, because that showed the absolute disrespect of the United States for the norms that even all its allies accepted. That is to say, this mining of the ports scandalized all its European allies, the entire Right Wing of the world, because it is one of the basic prohibitions.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Because when you are going to lay mines, the first thing you have to do is warn that you have laid the mines and warn everyone first; it is one of the obligations of the Laws of War, which is to warn immediately. The United States laid mines, without warning, several ships were destroyed and that was the last straw, that's where it comes in too, the way things have been changing in the way the United States handles things. At that time politically they believed they had the right to do anything and they could hardly care less what the world said.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Among the things that must be remembered here, is that the proof of all these events was not a matter that we had to look for hidden under the table. President Reagan of the United States with regard to the mines, said: But what are they complaining about if they are just very small mines that we laid; we presented all that in Court.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So what proof were we going to need that the US had laid mines, if the President of the United States was admitting it? And as William recalled, at the beginning, how shamelessly they discussed this issue in Congress.</p>

But it is one thing to desist from the action, that is, to stop the lawsuit, and it is another thing to desist from the Right that one has to claim it.

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The reality is, we weren't really creating new law, we were just executing existing law. And the simple truth is that with the rules of law that exist, if only they were truly applied and applied to everyone, we could live together in this world; that's the problem.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The problem is that these rules only apply to the weak and when you want to apply to the strong, then they try to suspend them. Let me give an example, there is an International Criminal Court that was created approximately 25 years ago, fortunately Nicaragua is not part of that Court, but also let's note that the United States is not a party, China is not a party, Russia is not a party, India is not a party, obviously there are a lot of countries that are not a party. But what's the matter? That in that Court they prosecute and have been dedicated to prosecuting the first three quarters of that History Africans; that is, there has been no European, no American there.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Five years ago ago someone tried to say something about the United States there, at that time there was Mr. Bolton this person of nefarious memory, Bolton, who was the one who organized things against us in 2018. Bolton was there and then was sent to tell the Criminal Court in The Hague, that if they touched a US American they were going to send the US Army against them all.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, what I'm going to do and give that example, is that in that International Criminal Court you can't touch the United States there, but you can touch all the Africans you like and all those who are part of it, who make a living out of their prosecutions; they live by applying the law to the vulnerable, but when anyone seeks to apply the law to powerful countries, then they do not.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's why what I'm saying is that in reality, and it was one of the things that really was an achievement, you might say an enormous one, that precisely a small country like Nicaragua put the United States in the dock of the accused. That was the great achievement, and if we could always do it that way, then obviously the Law would progress, then we would begin to be all more or less the same; but as long as the Law is only applied against us, and in favor of the powerful, then something is wrong there.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I think that young people have to learn in the same way that all of us have learned; that is to say, there are milestones in the history of a Country and in the personal history of all of us that serve to educate us, and possibly what Nicaragua did against the United States, is one of them, precisely because it serves to educate youth, so that they also realize that it is not some story currently invented by politicians what had happened in Nicaragua and what was happening, but that it is a reality, that the US was taken to an impartial Court (...) and it ruled in favor of Nicaragua.</p>

Perhaps you could refer a little to those historical moments, the conversations you had with them, the role they played. Go ahead, Doctor.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Yes, Alberto, at first maybe I hinted a little bit at that topic, because I say sometimes it seems that the Lawyer in Court who is the protagonist; the same way that in a hospital at a certain moment the Doctor who is there, or an engineer who participated in making a road.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But the important and vital thing in this, is not that a Lawyer has said to a leader, look, there are these mechanisms that can be done, those are the things that you can do. Well, in the same way, I suppose there are the engineers who will say, this can be done, that can be done.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The talent of the leader, the talent of Father d’Escoto, of Comandante Ortega was precisely to see the importance of this, and I say this not because we can say now that it was obvious; no, it is that it was not obvious, that's why I remembered on other occasions that there were many at that time who advised against going to court.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I even noted the Soviet Union at that time, the people of the Soviet Union did not advise us to go, that is, nothing less and nothing more than that, they did not advise not because they were in favor of the United States at all, but because they could not see how this Demand could prosper, because if it did not prosper, then then it would be worse for Nicaragua. So where was the success of this? In fact it was the way the case was prepared and handled.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Speaking of Father d’Escoto, the Chancellor, a brilliant man, the Father d’Escoto touched all the possible contacts there were, because they were there around the world, he went to consult friends at the United Nations, he went to Africa talking to people, consulting with all the lawyers, with all the people, to see about making this decision. It wasn't as straightforward as saying look, what about the idea of filing this lawsuit, anyone can say that.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The thing turns on the preparation and taking the decision, so that's where the leader's mind comes in, yes indeed this seems to me, this hospital yes we are going to do it here, or that hospital we are going to do it there, this we are going to do it here, not because the leader is a Doctor, or an Engineer in this, but the virtue of the leader is to know where the proper path in each field may be.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Because a Head of State is not an expert in all the world’s different fields, far from it; he is not supposed to be an expert in Public International Law or that he has to be a Doctor, or an Engineer and so on, but what he does have to have is a talent for making decisions and seeing where the best path may lie.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's why what I've always point out, because usually it looks like a team of lawyers are the ones who did everything; but it's not like that. Because that path was opened and they told us and set us along it, here you go now, and that path has already been prepared for us, and it was an intelligent and brilliant decision with a great deal of preparatory work that had been done to get there.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That is why it is very important to remember this, because it is much more than a team of Lawyers and that if there had not been that brilliant team... It's not that I'm minimizing the work that the Nicaraguan team did, or trying to offer false humility, obviously we were a very competent team, but also the United States had a very competent team; and when we were with Colombia, Colombia also had a very competent team.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, the decisions are not just to say: Ah, it's that my team was the best, or something. No, we're not necessarily talking about this team being better, it's that the decision gets made about that moment, and the path that is going to be followed.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">This was very important for me, and those two at that time, Father d’Escoto and Comandante Ortega were vital, because not all Sandinismo at that time agreed that this should be done. This was done because Comandante Ortega and Father d’Escoto were in agreement, they were determined that this was the right thing to do.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's why whenever I talk about this I recognize this crucial merit, because it is not an obvious merit, because for them nothing was sure about going before the Court; but the beginning of all this is due to them and to their decision and their vision in this matter. So that's really important.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">It was actually a great moment if you will, we were waiting for it, already obviously we knew or could have sensed that the sentence was going to be favorable, based on the case that the United States itself had said, it was not going to continue.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Because it must be remembered that when we asked for the Provisional Measures, the United States participated; then the United States said: The Court has no jurisdiction. And the United States participated and I mean that it participated with a huge team of lawyers, who even said that it was David against Goliath fighting, because it was the little team of Nicaragua against the dozens of gringos on the other side.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Over that, the United States fought to the death, and when the Court decided that it did have jurisdiction, the United States said: So much for that! I'm not going along with this! Because I already knew that once the Court accepted that it had jurisdiction, it was impossible for the Court to rule against Nicaragua. And how was it going to rule against, going back to what we had mentioned, if everything was proven and said in public, from the President admitting to the laying of mines? What is it that the court was going to have to spend time trying to decide? In other words, all of these were obvious violations of international law.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So in a sense, we saw it was almost impossible for the Court to come with a Ruling that was not favorable to Nicaragua. Obviously we didn't have details of how the whole thing was going to be, but we were had some idea... When Father d’Escoto arrived in The Hague there was also a team in Washington to cover the news, another team in Managua, so we were all there waiting. It was a great moment, obviously, one of those moments that one has once in a lifetime, maybe, having lived one.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Doctor, Nicaragua is currently handling or going through a new trial at the International Court of Justice; you already mentioned that it the joy of knowing that Nicaragua won against the United States. Do you have the same expectations with this new case, now against Germany, where it is demanded that the genocide against the Palestinian People be stopped?</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Well, we have the same expectations, but I have to warn that we are opening a new field, because Israel's action is obvious, and International Law says that when genocide is being committed or violations of the Law of War and International Humanitarian Law, all countries have an obligation to prevent that from happening.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, for example, what Germany is alleging is obviously not new because it is not part of the situation, it says: This case is based on the fact that Israel is committing a crime and not Germany; one must first prove that Israel is committing a crime before going against Germany. And I mention it even though the topic is very specific, I'm trying to generalize it.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The important thing about this issue that we are exploring right now is, because it is a universal obligation that we are invoking; that is, it is an obligation of all countries, the obligation to prevent genocide, not to allow genocide to occur; not only to punish it, but to prevent it, and to uphold the Law. So we are talking about obligations that not only concern Germany, they are universal obligations of all countries in the world; that is why it is a case that transcends by far Nicaragua's lawsuit against Germany.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">This is an issue that concerns all countries which, knowing that barbarities are being done on one side, continue to participate, and not by means of the Sanctions that I talked about earlier with Alberto, Sanctions put in place for political reasons; but, the obligation they have to act when something is actually happening, like what is happening in Palestine, and they do not do so.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So what we are invoking here is an obligation of all the Countries of the world. We are invoking it against Germany in particular, because Germany is the second Country that sells the most armaments to Israel and trades with Israel. Against the United States we cannot act because it does not accept jurisdiction, but Germany does.<br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So it is against Germany, but as I say, if this action proceeds against Germany, it means and the Court will have to say so, that this kind of obligation is applicable to everyone, because if the obligation only applied once genocide was already proven, then where is the obligation to prevent it? That is to say, if the obligation to avoid genocide and ensuring that the norms of International Humanitarian Law are complied with only come into play once genocide has already been proven and a Country has been destroyed; then where are those obligations to try to protect and prevent?</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So that is what we are exposing, in that aspect, it is a novel case. It is not to say: You have already judged this before and this leads here and so this is the consequence. We consider that it is a very important issue of International Law that we are invoking, and if this succeeds it will also be a milestone in the history of International Law, because an International Order will effectively be imposed as an obligation on all the countries of the World.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And here we are seeing it play out live, because it is very easy to say that less severe obligations are being fulfilled in some way, but here we are seeing a very serious matter where what is happening is self-evident, and that many powerful countries act if it they are not concerned. So, that's what's at stake here.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And also, with that background that we have, remembering, for example, just now that I was talking about the Terrorism Manual, Alberto, one of the points in the case with the United States was, to what extent did the Court have to decide, whether the United States was responsible for the violations of Humanitarian Law that the “Contra” was committing? Because the United States was not committing them directly, but it was the “Contra”.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So the United States was saying, No, this is not us committing them. But what the Court said is: Yes, however the United States had the obligation to avoid it as much as possible, and instead of avoiding it, what it did was issue that Manual, for example; so instead of preventing violations of humanitarian law, what it was doing was encouraging them.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, even that thread of connection exists between this case of ours and the current one, and it was one of the things that I didn't touch on in depth, but I mentioned it when I mentioned Nicaragua’s case: That Nicaragua was also asking the United States to stop providing weapons and give all the support to the “Contra”; here we are asking Germany to stop helping Israel in the genocide and the violations that it is committing.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So there is a thread that unites the cases, and as I say, if this is achieved, as we have all the optimism that it will be achieved, it will also impose new rules and issues that will be of the utmost importance, that Countries like the United States do not comply or act as if they are not involved, but once the Court says this, this will be an issue that will have to permeate throughout Society, in all Societies.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Right now there is almost a universal revulsion to everything that is happening in Palestine; so, if the rules of International law begin to be applied, the people of the world will understand what the norms are and will realize who is applying them and who is not; therefore, they will be able to better judge the importance of their Countries and their Governments respecting those Laws.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So we have that optimism, our Presidency Comandante Ortega, Compañera Rosario, have been pressing me on this issue; they are very attentive to everything that is happening. We are all concerned in a very heartfelt way, that is, very attached to the cause of our Palestinian Brothers.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I would like to ask Dr. Carlos Argüello, the fact that in this context we commemorate and remember, 40 years ago precisely this Initiative of presenting the accusation. But observing how International Law continues to be violated, how we have extraterritorial violations by states, recently what happened in Ecuador; we are sadly seeing what is happening in Gaza, with the position of the Zionist Government of Israel; and how we are seeing how that war is being mounted against Russia using Ukraine as a NATO penetration camp; and we are seeing many more things that put in reference a common factor, and that is that the United States is the one behind all these situations that are so deplorable for humanity.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In that sense, Dr. Carlos Argüello, before a ruling on which the United States argues that the Hague has no jurisdiction, those talents, those thoughts of the Judges at the International Court of Justice, what do they note, what do they say outside the action of their usual procedures to settle disputes, between one State and another State, given that common factor. Is the United States the country most accused in the International Court of Justice?</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Well, actually, here, and I have said it many times, the importance of this Appeal to the Court, or one of the very important points it has, is the education of Peoples. In the United States itself, where I have been able to read in the newspapers and given the limits controlling information that exists in the United States, the control of the mainstream media, but even there one can clearly see that even within the United States there is a very strong current, which is stunned and terrified with what it is seeing happening in Palestine. And that it has some force, because US morality and US law depend on the results of public polls.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So President Biden, so far as his morality permits, is now discovering that the Palestinians are suffering a little, but of course, he keeps giving Israel weapons, but publicly they make some admission, because the polls make them. But there also comes a time when the polls become irresistible, because piublic opinion is what ultimately chooses the heads of State.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, a case like the one we are taking right now, is a case that also serves you to give context to this public opinion, and that no matter how much they don't want it in the normal, traditional US media, such as the main newspapers, the news programs and the main television channels of the United States, there are now a great many information mechanisms that cannot be completely controlled, despite the fact that the United States obviously, and you know better than I do, how they seek to control even Tik Tok and all those issues that they don't want to be interfered with in any way. But now it is very difficult to control all the information media.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, a Court Ruling and what is happening in the Court serves to educate and give impetus to people and give context to what they are demanding, and to the demands they make internally in their own Countries, which is also a great force.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That is why, returning to what I was saying, and to which I have referred for many years and I have repeated it on some occasions in Nicaragua when I have been interviewed, because it is a truth and that is how I have seen it for 40 years, it is something I read from a French jurist: What do you do when a Power does not comply? What path is left for a country?</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In this case, as I say, not even the UN Security Council anymore, because nor can we appeal to the Security Council, so what path does a country have left? The mobilization of Shame! The mobilization of Shame! To go to court and have a Court Sentence that is not followed, is a disgrace that no government can avoid. And if there is an internal movement inside the United States, even if the mainstream media don't give it publicity, or officially, those things do come to light, and that's very important.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, obviously it is not a nuclear bomb that one is handling, but even so it is a very important information bomb, it is an education bomb and, in that sense, we are motivating, mobilizing and moving the World. What we can try and contribute is this modest contribution, and that is part of our contribution.</p>

Any of the compañeros want to ask something?… Well, I think we just have to thank each of the participants, but mainly Dr. Carlos Argüello. Doctor Argüello, it has been a pleasure to talk with you, we thank you very much for having the opportunity to have you here this morning. Congratulations to all of us on this 40th anniversary.
