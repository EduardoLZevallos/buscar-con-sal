in the midday edition of Multinoticias on Canal 4</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>October 21<sup>st</sup> 2024</strong></em></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><em><strong><img alt="" height="250" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario125.jpg.html" width="400" /></strong></em></p>

<p>Today, October 21st with our hearts full of Respect, Thanks and Recognition, we remember two dear Friends and Brothers, two Compañeros, Comrades, two Leaders, two Brave Combatants who in their Thoughts and Actions already inhabited that Better World which we well know should be Fraternal, in Solidarity, Just and Complementary... A Better World, a World of Dignity, A World of Sovereignty, the World we all want and urgently need and towards which we work.</p>

<p>With a mixture of admiration and wonder, a mixture typical of the Human Spirit, one not invented in the machines of what they call Artificial Intelligence, which may well have very good uses, but cannot replace the Human Spirit. And when we say mixture, we do so because all perspectives are there inside the Human Soul, so we talk of admiration and we talk of wonder.</p>

<p>The Human Spirit rises up, it is Knowledge, it is Consciousness and it is Experience, and its sums are very often painful, but above all hopeful. Experience, Knowledge, Awareness, Unity of Struggles and Purposes, of Efforts to defeat injustice, and relentlessly persecute Hatred and Evil so as to make a way towards Better Horizons of Brother and Sisterly Coexistence and the ability to share and to live; to share and coexist, going through life together.</p>

<p>Those Special, Extraordinary Human Beings that we remember today, springing from the raised Consciousness of the world's Peoples, are, Maurice Rupert Bishop from that Caribbean full of Character and Dignity, in Revolutionary Grenada and from the New Jewel, which was the name of his Movement for Sovereignty, Dignity, Brother and Sisterhood, and above all Justice and Freedom. The justice and freedom we deserve. Freedom from all forms of discrimination, oppression, domination and subjugation.</p>

<p>There, with Bishop, with that New Jewel, in that Revolutionary Grenada, with all his Comrades, they sang loudly, and talked about the New World, they sang: Always Forward, Backwards Never!</p>

<p>Eternal glory to Maurice Rupert Bishop, who died in a way, which is why we say, that mixture of astonishment, of pain, that mixture of putting one's feet on the ground, sensing one's feet, sinking into the earth, knowing that unfortunately everything is possible, just as what was thought impossible in Grenada was made possible by those who unfortunately make deals with the devil.</p>

<p>The New Jewel, A Vibrant, Ever-under-construction Story of those Free Women and Men, of Serious Powerful Souls, who between Paths, at Crossroads, through Hard Times and Better Times, are still committed to fulfilling our Destiny as proud, enlightened, inspiring Human Beings capable of Always Going Further On. Always Forward, Backwards Never!</p>

<p>Honor and Glory to Beloved Compañero Maurice Bishop, to all his Comrades, who were massacred, painfully, sullied and killed by the vileness of those who made, as we have said, and go on making deals with the devil.</p>

<p>We remember them in admiration and deep affection for all their Compañeros and Compañeras, to those who there, facing the firing squad, gave their Lives crying out for the Better World that we are determined to build and inhabit.</p>

<p>And too Compañeras and Compañeros, we also remember the Brother of immense Friendship and Solidarity with Nicaragua, Compañero and Brother Muammar Gaddhafi, who from the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was able to see in Nicaragua a Brave and Triumphant Revolution, a People who assumed, and continue to assume our place in history, fighting with the most Exalted Dignity and Courage, against the Empires of the Earth.</p>

<p>Our People, Nicaraguans by the Grace of God, fighting with our bare Hands, our Clean Hands, our Brave Hands, our Hands Dignified with the Stone of Andrés, with the indomitable Guerrillas of our Immortal General Augusto Sandino, with the Heroic and Victorious Continuation of the Guerrillas of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, with the Front, with Daniel, with all the Heroic Soldiers of our Patriotic Nation, Warriors of Love, of Light, of Life, of the Hope that we have, because we have overcome and we deserve that Place of Honor which we indeed have secured, as we said, in the History of the Bravery of the Peoples.</p>

<p>What would Brother Gaddhafi; say today faced with this brutal, barbaric, savage World, with the worst we may well say, of the World that the Imperialists of the Earth deploy...! What would he say today in the face of so much crime, in the face of the genocides that we see every day, and whose broadcast dissemination we know responds to the reasoning of the colonialist, neocolonialist and imperialist oppressors of the Earth... We know that they aim to get us accustomed to blood and pain so as to generate indifference, another inconceivable, and absolutely condemnable assault on the Sensitive Soul of the Human Community that Soul which we know is one of inspired Solidarity!</p>

<p>What would Compañero Muammar Gaddhafi, our Brother, say in the face of the reality that he well knew in advance and about which he warned, of challenge and change for the enslaved, the looted, the oppressed, those millions of Human Beings who knew how to resist, who know how to resist, those millions of Human Beings killed by Empires.</p>

<p>But there are always millions of others, there are always millions who occupy the place of Dignity, who, as we are well aware, knew how to resist the perverse policies of extermination in Their Africa, where the Struggles Continue and the Victories will undoubtedly Continue because they are True. As Samora Machel used to say, also a President... Exterminated...? No! No, the Struggle was not exterminated, it was not extinguished, but, rather, martyred by the Imperialists of the Earth. The Struggles go on, and the Victories are Certain! The struggles continue, Brothers and Sisters...!</p>

<p>What would Gaddhafi say, faced with the crimes against humanity committed against the Arab Peoples today, every day; those crimes they want us to observe in order to make us indifferent, but the more we see them the more outraged we are! Crimes against Heroic Palestine, against Lebanon, against Syria, and against so many Countries, Peoples and Cultures threatened with destruction, suffering and annihilation, by Imperialism, the Imperialists of the Earth and World Zionism!</p>

<p>What would Compañero Gaddhafi, Colonel Gaddafi, say, gazing into this savage, brutal world, more and more decomposed, more and more bloody, more and more unjust, more and more outraged also, by aggressions of all kinds, as well as the Usual ones committed against our Peoples everywhere. Because we are one Family, one Land, one Future, as we said a few days ago at a Global Summit.</p>

<p>How would our Brother be praising our Peoples, when we resist, because we resist, when we fight, because we fight, and because we do not let ourselves give in, we do not cower, we are not afraid, we are of the same Race of Heroic and Extraordinary Beings, determined to permanently denounce those criminal models of dispossession, demanding the liberation of our Sacred Communities and Territories, which are ours, and where we live standing tall, never on our knees.</p>

<p>From the Heart and with a Burning Heart we pay tribute to the People of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, to its Leader, Beloved Compañero Muammar Gaddafi, a Brother always close to the Nicaraguan people. I remember, this is a parenthesis, I remember when an influenza occurred that was going to become a Global Epidemic, how he called us and how he was anxious about sending medicines to address that crisis in our Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Compañero and Brother of our Blessed and Forever Free Nation, Muammar Gaddhafi, Hero and Martyr, together with his children, his family, his Combatants; Faithful Friend of this Glorious, Victorious, Sovereign, Dignified, Sandinista Patriotic Nation of Ours, by the Grace of God, there he gazes at us from the Infinite Eternal Space where Souls vibrate and continue to be Flames and Sacrosanct Fires illuminating the Roads, the Routes of True Truths, and of imperative Justice.</p>

<p>These routes by which we are repairing wrongdoing and damage, denouncing and demanding reparation for so much incommensurable plunder and death, massacres, brutal indescribable crimes against humanity, imposed in Our America, all those so-called conquests, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, our world, not theirs, the world that was not conquered, this Brave world which does not belong to them, which they occupy only in the name of the Infernos representing the colonialists and imperialists of the Earth who continue to cover us in blood.</p>

<p>Brother, Compañero and Comrade Maurice Bishop<br />
Brother and Compañero Muammar Gaddhafi</p>

<p>You live on, your Peoples live on,<br />
Our Struggles Go On, struggles which continue because We continue...</p>

<p>Always Further On !<br />
The Victories are ours,<br />
The Dignity of the Peoples !<br />
We are a Family, One Family, One Future.</p>

<p>Going Further On Always...! We will never lose our memory. Never lose our story. We know that every path brings challenges, difficulties, crossroads, but we come and we go, Going Onward, Always Further On, in unchanged Love, in true Hope, which no one can snatch away from us.</p>

<p>Warm embraces compañeras and compañeros from our Comandante Daniel and from every one of us here was we are, with the strength and health God gives us, to continue creating, from one battle to another, the future we deserve, free from Poverty. Warm embraces.</p>
