<p>A very good afternoon, Compañera. Good afternoon, Beloved Families of our Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Today, Wednesday, November 6th, we have several topics that are of priority for us. First of all, to say, to affirm that, as always, our Hearts and Prayers are with the People of our Sister Cuba, the Cuban Families who confront both the criminality of the Yankee Blockade, and, with the same strength of resistance of that Great People, the new phenomenon of what is called Climate Change, which is nothing but the expression, the manifestation of the predatory injustice that the colonialists, neocolonialists and imperialists have bequeathed to the World that they did not completely destroy, but which is now suffering the consequences of all that destruction, depredation and looting, and which now is fighting, because we are all fighting, against precisely those aggressive and interventionist policies that generated all this and which now threaten us, generating so much pain and suffering in the world.</p>

<p>We have now seen in recent weeks very many aggressive manifestations of what is called “the Weather”. But it is not just the weather. It is the destroyed Earth, it is our Mother Earth that we have stripped of its natural protective elements; plundered with that eagerness to take everything in exchange for nothing, and we end up with the consequences. That is what brings about these phenomena.</p>

<p>We are sure that from this latest event Cuba will come through, Great and Victorious as it really is, strengthened, because they have a wonderful effective system of Care and Protection in the face of such Emergencies, where there is coordination, there is organization along with effective and permanent follow-up, in the face of these misfortunes with which that other World also plagues us.</p>

<p>Then too, in the small hours, we learned the results of the elections that took place yesterday in the United States and we have sent our Dignified and Warm Greetings to the People of that Country, to the United States People, whom we know for their demonstrated solidarity with the Just and Courageous Struggles of the Peoples of the World, and with their own Struggles.</p>

<p>Today we are also moved by the transition to another Plane of Life of an extraordinary Woman, Communicator, Compañera, Militant and Combatant of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, who gave herself via her Life and Work, with Loyalty, Firmness and absolute Coherence, to the Sandinista Cause, to the Cause of the Liberation of our People, in the Honorable and Glorious Guerrilla and Warrior Ranks of the FSLN and the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>We knew and admired, respected and imitated Mayra as a Woman, as a Militant, as a Revolutionary... She has been a sublime inspiration, Consistent to the End, she breathed and perspired in Love for her People... A permanent symbol of the Courage of us Women, who, thanks to Sisters like her, today in our Nicaragua ensure Gender Equality in all Areas of our Power, our People's Power, our Direct, Sandinista, Revolutionary and Evolutionary Democracy.</p>

<p><br />
We loved her, and we love her, Mayra. To Vilma, her sister, Claudia, Arlen, her daughters, her grandchildren, her entire Family of Strong Sandinistas, we extend our Solidarity and Combative Embrace, in these hours that mark her Transition to Another Eternal Plane of Life.</p>

<p>Our Comandante Daniel, recognizing that tireless Revolutionary and Militant Work of Mayra, recognizing all her Merits as a Communicator and Militant of Sandinismo, Always Further On, will be delivering the Order of Cultural Independence Rubén Darío to his Family, and this will be given among the multiple Funeral Honors... which are not Funeral Honors, rather they are Honors to her Life, Recognitions to her Life, which she, because the Spirit lives on and transcends, will be receiving together with her Loved Ones, with the Growing Love and from the Growing Love of our People, in particular from us Nicaraguan Women.</p>

<p>Always Further On, Beloved Mayra...! In all the Combats and in all the Victories, in every Circumstance and in the face of all the Difficulties and Challenges, here you are fighting, here you will be fighting, illuminating and building the Future.</p>

<p>Warm embraces to the whole Family, to the girls, to the granddaughters, all the grandchildren, and to Vilma all our Love. All of us are and will continue to be members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front.</p>

<p>Fellow journalist Tirsa Sáenz also sent me here, a characterization of all Mayra's Revolutionary Merits: A Leader, working with Fellow Leaders since the 1970s, and in the Ministry of the Interior, in State Security; also Responsible for Information and Analysis there, working as a Communicator; Founder of the Magazine Visión Sandinista, which she edited until her last breath.</p>

<p>On August 12, '97, Mayra formally presented the proposal to create Visión Sandinista to our Comandante Daniel, our Comandante approved it and told her that she would have his firm support, which has been maintained during these two and a half decades of existence.</p>

<p>The first edition of the Magazine appeared three months after Mayra's proposal to Comandante Daniel.<br />
Her Family will be accompanying the Honors we award to Mayra and her Militant, Consequential Life, from 4 pm in Sierras de Paz. And tomorrow in the Sacred Ground of Sierras de Paz she will receive a Christian Burial.</p>

<p>We are Christians, we are Christians and as Christians we believe in Brother and Sisterhood, in True Love, and we defend Peace.</p>

<p>Onward, Mayra...! You are building the future!</p>
