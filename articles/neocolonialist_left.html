toni solo, March 24th 2009</span><br><br>Feinting Left on certain themes and issues while in
practice siding with the Right has long been a tactic of progressive
or liberal people in the intellectual managerial classes that
dominate information and debate. While the Internet may have expanded
the membership of those classes of people, it has done little to
change their patterns of behaviour. Recently, Nicaragua has provided
a clear example of the kinds of contradictions that can develop when
influential people find their status and prestige put to the question
by outsiders.<br><br>To put the matter in some perspective in global
terms, it has always been reasonable to talk about an aristocracy of
labour in the rich countries, able to enjoy a higher standard of
living as a result of their countries' imperialist power and reach.
Occasional bouts of working-class solidarity with oppressed peoples
seldom disturbed the fundamental forced accommodation of labour in
Western Bloc countries &#8211; those of North America and Europe and
their Pacific allies - to the brutal and criminally inefficient
global  capitalist status quo.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Obvious examples of that abound in the
history of decolonization in the 20th Century which threw up contradictions within the
imperialist countries' progressive sectors &#8211; for example, the
French Communist Party voting &#8220;special powers&#8221; in 1956 for the
colonial authorities in Algeria or the pre-war Popular Front
government in France banning &#8220;L'Étoile Nord-Africaine&#8221;. In
contemporary terms, it is certainly possible now to argue that Latin
America's growing liberation from imperialist domination is
generating contradictions within the Western Bloc intellectual
managerial elites. People disagree widely about supporting the FARC
in Colombia, for example, or in their approval of Brazil's President
da Silva. Nicaragua is an especially interesting case in this
regard.<br><br>The current mainstream corporate media consensus about
Nicaragua is that the FSLN government is an oppressive authoritarian
project dedicated to the aggrandizement of a corrupt clique lead by
Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo. That version of reality
is touted relentlessly by the right-wing Nicaraguan political
opposition, despite the embarrassingly inconvenient fact that this
opposition enjoys both a majority in the National Assembly and also
overwhelming control of the country's main news media. It is a
version promoted equally relentlessly by the governments of the
United States, Canada and their European allies.<br><br>One
might
have thought Western Bloc countries' progressive intellectual
managerial classes would be wary of stringing along with that
right-wing consensus. In fact, to the contrary, various influential
progressive figures have intervened to strengthen and promote it.
Their motives seem to be ones of personal friendship with former
revolutionaries, now social democrat members of the Nicaraguan
opposition, whom they came to know during Nicaragua's first
revolutionary government of the 1980s. Those personal loyalties seem to
have merged imperceptibly over the years with&nbsp;class loyalties.<br><br>The most recent issue
in Nicaragua revealing the contradictions within those progressive
intellectual managerial classes has been the claim that the recent
municipal elections in Nicaragua involved massive fraud in favour of
the FSLN government. The broader claim, whose logic the allegations
of fraud follow, is that the FSLN government is not a progressive
government and has betrayed people in Nicaragua by failing to deliver
major social and economic improvements. From that false premise the
FSLN's pseudo-progressive critics seem to deduce that there must have
been fraud in the municipal elections because the FSLN could not have
mobilised such wide popular support if they are failing to deliver social
and economic improvement. <br><br>This last argument is tacit and
implicit, rather
than explicit, in other arguments advanced by critics of the FSLN, and is completely
contradicted by the facts. For specifics one can refer to a <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/burbach02272009.html">recent
article by Roger Burbach</a> and a <a href="anti-burbach.html">point-by-point rebuttal</a> of his article
from us in Tortilla con Sal. Burbach's article is only the latest in
a series of interventions by people friendly with former
revolutionary leaders like Dora Maria Tellez, Henry Ruiz or
Luis Carrion. Through 2008 leading intellectuals, José Saramago,
Noam Chomsky, Ignacio Ramonet and many others &#8211; who know very
little in practice about the reality of daily life in Nicaragua &#8211;
have intervened to comment critically on the policies of Nicaragua's FSLN
government. <br><br>Late in December 2008, a group of Nicaraguan and
internationalist writers and editors coordinated a <a href="letter.html">manifesto</a> that
demonstrated extremely wide international support for the FSLN
government. The impressive and broad support for that manifesto
contradicts the kind of false anti-FSLN propaganda promoted by
individuals like Roger Burbach and numerous others. So very clearly
something unusual is happening with regard to how political and
economic developments in Nicaragua are reported by supposedly
progressive media outlets and&nbsp;international progressive opinion in general. <br><br>If one asks a question like, &#8220;What
do individuals like  Roger Burbach or Noam Chomsky, Eduardo Galeano, Ariel Dorfman and Ignacio Ramonet know about routine
daily life in Nicaragua for the impoverished majority?&#8221; - the
answer, clearly, is very little. Or if one asks, &#8220;which is likely to
be more important to eminent individuals like these &#8211; the
well-being of distant, impoverished people in Nicaragua or their own
prestige and influence in the support networks of which they are a
part?&#8221; The answer, equally clearly, is the latter.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">One
sees this in the support given to privileged members of Nicaragua's
oligarchy like Carlos Fernando Chamorro. Chamorro's false reporting and
completely self-serving account of &nbsp;politics in Nicaragua is
promoted &nbsp;by leading writers on both the Right and Left internationally. The version
of victims of the Chamorro family media dictatorship - like one of Nicaragua's leading investigative reporters <a href="eloisa_ibarra.html">Eloisa Ibarra</a>
- gets erased. The same distorted version of events in Nicaragua,
long&nbsp;retailed by mainstream corporate media like the New York
Times, El Pais, or the Guardian, now appears too in leading
progressive web sites like Counterpunch or ZNet. Much of the coverage
is based on a bogus argument from authority - if leading progressive
intellectuals think that is the truth about Nicaragua then it must be
so. Fact-based contrary accounts are now effectively censored.</p><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Within
Nicaragua, it is impossible to take seriously interventions by
internationally renowned intellectuals in favour of a Nicaraguan
political opposition which is almost
completely aligned with the great powers of North America and Europe.
Outside Nicaragua, these progressive critics of the FSLN government
base their criticisms on the version of events in Nicaragua they get
from oligarchy propagandists like Carlos Fernando Chamorro and from
former revolutionaries like Dora Maria Tellez, Hugo Torres and
Victor Hugo Tinoco, for example. Within Nicaragua the political party
those people lead &#8211; the Sandinista Renewal Movement - has never won
more than 7% of the vote. Unless they overtly support the Nicaraguan
right-wing, progressive foreign critics of the FSLN in practice work
to represent the views of a privileged elite rejected by most
ordinary people in Nicaragua.<br><br>So when an article like Roger
Burbach's gets published in Counterpunch or Carlos Fernando Chamorro
gets a prominent praise-piece in the New York Times, those
outlets are publishing
information that is at best extremely misleading and at worst
deliberately false. The same is true when Le Monde Diplomatique
publishes articles by disingenuous pseudo-progressive Nicaraguan
politicans like Monica Baltodano, who persistently misrepresents
Nicaragua's FSLN government's record, for example, on the economy. A
contrary view is no longer represented &#8211; false information about
Nicaragua favouring the right-wing opposition therefore now goes
unchallenged in the progressive media that publish it.<br><br>So
the
issue is not just one of the facts about what is happening in
Nicaragua but a wider one relating to the integrity of the
intellectual managerial class that dominates Western Bloc left-wing
information networks. If they are dead wrong about Nicaragua, there
is less reason to trust what they publish about current affairs in
other countries. Likewise, one is entitled to question their
integrity if the information they spread, in this case about
Nicaragua, is based on the personal friendships of influential
individuals in the Western Bloc progressive intellectual managerial
network with people now aligned, for all practical purposes, with
the imperialist powers. (These and other issues also&nbsp;recur in
arguments about the reliability of information resources like
Wikipedia. The Eloisa Ibarra case demonstrates the utter futility of
relying on newspaper accounts as sources of reporting on Nicaragua.)<br><br>Obviously, a tiny fraction of one
percent of people in Central America read, for example, Counterpunch
or Le Monde Diplomatique or Z Communications. There is a deep sense
in which, for the global majority, what the Western Bloc progressive
intellectual managerial classes produce is totally irrelevant. But on
another level, these classes enjoy the inheritance of neocolonial
privilege. They tend to dominate and manipulate the creation of a publicly
falsifiable record of accurate and reliable information that people
internationally can use for reference. On that level, the issue of
facilitating free debate from knowledgeable and authoritative sources
is far from trivial.<br><br>At Tortilla con Sal, our experience has
been demoralising and disappointing in that regard. In fact, one can reasonably argue that debate on Nicaragua &#8211;
and perhaps on other issues as well, since one cannot really know -
is being stifled because influential people in the Western Bloc
intellectual managerial class resist being shown up as ignorant and
baselessly prejudiced. One has to ask what difference there is
between this kind of behaviour and the kinds of socio-economic
behaviour in the media&nbsp;analysed in books like Chomsky and Herman's
&#8220;Manufacturing consent&#8221;.<br><br>While
repressive, manipulative behaviour by people
ostensibly avowing radical or progressive views may perhaps be
disappointing, it is hardly surprising. Managers always behave like
that. The more serious matter is that this corrupt intellectual and
moral behaviour amounts in practice to neocolonialist collaboration
with governments like that of the United States and the countries of
the European Union. When the Western Bloc intellectual managerial
classes facilitate false attacks on the FSLN government in Nicaragua
they are helping the right-wing Nicaraguan opposition - and that
opposition's
masters in the powerful imperialist governments of the United States
and Europe - destroy the first chance people in Nicaragua have had for
nearly thirty years of
major, sustained improvements in their lives</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
