development: economic, political and social contexts in
Nicaragua today. <br>
      <br>
      <small>Interview with Marcia Saavedra</small><br>
      </big>By Karla Jacobs<br>
April 26th 2010<br>
      </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><br>
Marcia Saavedra is a Nicaraguan activist with many years experience
within the women's movement. For eight years she worked with <a href="http://www.comminit.com/es/node/39375/37">Ixchen</a>, one of the
most important organizations in terms of the defence and protection of
women's rights in Nicaragua. She has also worked with other
organizations including the <a href="http://www.reddemujerescontralaviolencia.org.ni/">Women's
Network Against Violence</a> and the Popol Nah Foundation as well
as coordinating a number of studies into areas like sexual abuse and
female economic integration.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In this interview Marcia talks about</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">
achievements and set backs of the </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"></span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Nicaraguan </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">women's
movement</span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"> </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">over the last few
years and explains why she feels a bit disillusioned with the direction
the movement has taken recently. She also analyses the different
effects - negative and positive - the two development models
(capitalist and socialist) currently fighting for predominance in
Nicaragua provoke in terms of the position of women within the country.

      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Karla Jacobs: Tell me about the
development of the defence and protection of women's rights during the
last few years in Nicaragua?</span><br>
      <br>
Marcia Saavedra: The last few years have been very important for
[Nicaraguan women] in terms of the amount that has been achieved
through the signing of different conventions and agreements. The
different governments have signed and ratified many conventions that
favour women's human rights.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
There has been important development in this sense. We cannot deny it.
But this progress has been made above all within a legal sphere. So now
we have a legal basis. But the difficult part is turning that legal
basis into concrete progress on the ground. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We have a complete legal
framework that favours women's rights</span><br>
      <br>
Today we can say that
in Nicaragua we have a full conceptual framework, a legal framework
that protects and defends women's rights. <br>
      <br>
Over the last few years, though, there have been certain set backs to
the achievements of the women's movement - and
when I talk about the women's movement I am talking about a movement
that includes the Feminist Movement, the Autonomous Movement and all
the women involved in different activities in their communities. <br>
      <br>
The women's movement knows that this sort of legal protection of our
rights exist, but we
are also aware that it is necessary for the government to carry out
actions [to effectively put this legislation into practise] and to
bring the plans on which they based their signing of the international
conventions up to date.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Above all, it is essential that there is less manipulation of women's
rights as a result of adverse political situations relating to
different political parties or election processes. That is where we
feel, or should I say, personally I feel, that women's rights are
manipulated.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
A clear example of this sort of manipulation was the overturning of the
Penal Code article that permitted therapeutic abortion. Everyone knows
how polemical that issue has become. And that is one of the set backs
we have suffered in terms of women's rights.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: You talk about laws,
legislation and conventions - and of course all that is very relevant,
because without the legal framework you mentioned there wouldn't be
anything to work from. But it seems to me that one must also focus on
the day to day reality of Nicaraguan women. In general terms, how do
you
view the process of female empowerment in Nicaragua over the last few
years - if indeed you consider that such a process exists - ?&nbsp; </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Women's day to day life doesn't
reflect the protection and defence required by the laws that favour our
rights<br>
      </span><br>
MS: ... Yes I do think things have progressed, but there are certain
things that limit that progress, like the economic situation. Often, as
women, we acknowledge that we have the right to live without violence,
but, if we aren't able to defend ourselves financially in our everyday
lives, then old cultural patterns prevail over the legal base [that
establishes our rights]. <br>
      <br>
So even if women acknowledge they have the right to live without
violence and the right to report violence they are subjected to, a
lot of the time their day to day reality obliges them to keep quiet,
not to claim their rights. <br>
      <br>
This happens largely because of the lack of support from the State for
women in
vulnerable situations - because the legislation is all
there, but it is administered by the patriarchy. ...<br>
      <br>
The women's movement has facilitated a certain amount of progress
[in terms of female empowerment], something which has been achieved
above all&nbsp; with support from civil society organizations and,
during the
last few years, with significant support, I would say, from the
government. Personally I acknowledge the support the government is
offering to women with the Zero Usury program. <br>
      <br>
I do think, however, that there is a lack of critical consciousness in
this sort of empowerment [model]. As women we should be asking
ourselves "what are our basic needs?" We should be saying, "on its own,
the provision of a loan through Zero Usury isn't enough to resolve the
different problems we experience." An integral solution has to
take into account other aspects of our everyday lives.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sometimes when a women is
financially independent she is at greater risk of domestic violence at
home </span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: But, it seems to me that
the situation becomes even more
complicated, because, what you say is true - if a woman has no
financial power, she is unlikely to conquer other forms of power within
the home.&nbsp; </span><br>
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">But this logic is contradicted
by another reality. Because in Nicaragua women have come to make up a
significant percentage of the national work force. Compared to ten or
fifteen years ago a lot more women work outside the home today. But
there are sociologists and other experts who say that, sometimes when
women work they become even more vulnerable at home. These experts have
found that, as a result
of women's new financial power, their partners become more violent.
&nbsp; </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">This is linked to the fact
that, while the number of female workers has increased, the numbers of
male workers has decreased. The unemployment crisis affects men more
than women. And unemployment often provokes men to be more
violent.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
MS: You are right. From my experience working with women in the barrios
I know that there are more opportunities for women than for men in
terms of access to micro credit or work in the Free Trade Zones. <br>
      <br>
Money is another form of power and when men feel they are losing the
power they have always had, the power that being the breadwinner gives
them, then they are likely to become even more violent. This is why
[domestic] violence is being carried out in the most brutal form -
atrocious sexual violence and feminicide. <br>
      <br>
It's ironic to see that often what happens with micro credit projects
benefiting women is that
the men are actually the ones who control how the money is spent and on
what.
This is a palpable trend in the barrios. <br>
      <br>
So it is not enough to have a legal base [guaranteeing women's rights]
and for women to have access to paid work and credit - these things
complement each other, but what is also necessary is transversal
education to allow society to develop critical consciousness [regarding
these issues].&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The new approach to gender
equality in the national curriculum<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: What, then, do you
think of the recent changes to the national curriculum? I am not
familiar with the new curriculum but I know that there have been
significant changes that involve the inclusion of transversal themes
like gender equality. &nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span> <br style="font-style: italic;">
MS:<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>I am familiar with the
new curriculum because I have children studying both in primary and
secondary school. Also, I recently took part in a scientific forum
about formal and informal education during which [the new curriculum]
was discussed. <br>
      <br>
And yes, gender equality is included as a transversal theme within the
curriculum. The intention is valid and I hope that [this emphasis on
gender equality] goes on to become a State policy within the Education
Ministry so that it covers all the different materials and texts used
within the education system.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
At the same time, though, there is a tendency within schools
for teachers to talk about the different male and female roles - "what
does your mum do? what does your dad do?" I have seen those questions
used in homework. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So, this revolution within the Education Ministry has to be complete,
it has to be integral. Most of the teachers were educated within the
logic of the former
ideology, the former culture. So they have to unlearn that and be
educated in the new approach, the new curriculum, the new culture the
Education Ministry is trying to implement.&nbsp; </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: The sort of transformation
process we are talking about is something that takes years. I am from a
country where, about 100 years ago, there was a feminist revolution
which triumphed. Women took to the streets to demand the right to vote
and as well as other
political and civic rights. And some were killed because of their
struggle. But they achieved their objective, they triumphed. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">And, in a way, I have always
felt like Nicaragua hasn't experienced this sort of cultural
transformation process.
This has a lot to do with imperialist intervention in Nicaragua which,
apart from the oppression of struggles for popular liberation which
themselves bring significant benefits for women, certain Western
feminist ideas
have been imposed on countries like Nicaragua where they are out of
context and often provoke division or setbacks. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">I don't know if a movement for
the true empowerment of women has yet been born in Nicaragua. I don't
know if it will emerge at some point in the future. I am interested to
hear if you believe a true
social and cultural transformation favouring the position of women
within Nicaraguan society is possible and how it should be encouraged.
&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
MS: Of course change takes places as part of a process. All
transformation processes take time. However, I don't think it is
correct to say that we have not started yet, that [this process] hasn't
yet been born. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Women have played key roles in
Nicaragua's recent history <br>
      </span><br>
I accept that female participation in certain contexts of Nicaragua's
recent past has been contextual, but it has also been
significant. As part of those contexts and without the principal
objective of being protagonists or of demanding respect for their
rights, women have demonstrated they are [every bit as capable as men].
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      <br>
In the 1970s [during the popular insurrection] women were in charge of
many things - women were also used, in that sense, during those years
of conflict, but it was clear to all that women were a necessary [part
of that struggle]. Women played a very important role in the 80s
[during
the revolution and Contra war] as well. But it was not until the 90s
that we achieved some form of public acknowledgement [of women] which
is when women's rights organizations begin to emerge. <br>
      <br>
I feel like we have emerged in Nicaragua. Because unlike many countries
in Latin America we have experienced a true revolution during which
society was forced to allow women to take on equal importance as men in
many different ways. ...<br>
      <br>
So yes, I think we have made a certain amount of progress. But I do
feel disillusioned about the fact that a lot of the time NGOs and
women's organizations get caught up in party political issues and
forget about the day to day reality of most Nicaraguan women. Often
[organizations] forget about the real needs that exist. It is as a
result of its involvement in political contradictions, in political
banter, that the Nicaraguan women's movement has lost its way a
bit. <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Certain leaders' political
protagonism has weakened the Nicaraguan women's movement</span><br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>I can't say we haven't
started at all. We have, but sometimes it's a bit like one step
forward and two steps back. And right now I think we have taken several
steps back. [This has happened] mainly
as a result of the political alliance the Autonomous Women's Movement
signed with the MRS party. <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Because the ones that
signed the alliance were almost all leaders of the Women's Network
Against Violence. And effectively, they signed the alliance in name of
all the women who belong to that network. After the alliance was signed
the Network changed, it practically became </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">a space to discuss MRS' political
campaign. In doing this they carried out an abuse [of power] in my
opinion. <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
And I believe that this has come to weaken the movement. The
movement lost credibility at a grass roots level because many women,
myself included, have very strong political views. And freedom of
thought, freedom to believe in who we want to believe in, is all part
of our empowerment. But a situation where a group of women who believe
themselves to be better educated and more intellectual is trying to
tell us who we
should vote for - that goes against a process of empowerment.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
I think that the women's movement has lost momentum as a result of
this sort of action. And so now, the [transformation process] will take
longer. <br>
      <br>
Additionally I think [the signing of this alliance] has created a
situation in which the government views the demands of the movement as
political provocations. Because now if the movement
demands something specific that the government doesn't want to give,
then the government justifies itself saying [the demand] is not based
on a grass roots reality but is part of the political opposition's
attempts to undermine the government.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The capitalist development model
      </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: I would like to talk a bit about the
different development models that exist here in Nicaragua. Up until
2007 the model that existed was the capitalist development model
promoted by the financially rich nations. Now, since the FSLN took
power in 2007 there are two models fighting to dominate the country's
development, because now we also have the socialist development model
promoted by ALBA.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Talking about the first model, the capitalist model, to what extent do
you think that this model negatively or positively affects the position
of women in a country like Nicaragua?<br>
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      </span> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>MS: It is
totally clear that this model negatively affects us. We know well
that capitalism is based on a logic which consistently benefits the
most powerful. So, of course, within the capitalist system, women are
the vulnerable ones, the ones with less opportunities. <br>
      <br>
The capitalist system doesn't benefit women at all. And the more
extreme version - the neo liberal system in which all the basic
services are privatized - is much worse. Because who is the one
ultimately
responsible for ensuring her family benefits from basic services? The
woman. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Free Trade Agreements
form an important part of the</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
neoliberal capitalist model. And who are the ones in powerful positions
within companies, within everything to do with industry and production?
Men. <br>
      <br>
So yes, this model affects the majority of women terribly. Of course a
small number of women will always succeed within a capitalist context.
But we are well aware that the capitalist development model puts women
at a disadvantage.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: And culturally, in what way
do you think that this model negatively or positively affects women?</span><br>
      <br>
MS: I think this model is double edged in terms of its cultural impact.
In certain ways it
has favoured women because media, internet and other new technologies
form an important part of consumer culture within a globalized context.
[Access to those technologies] favours women because we are able to
keep
ourselves informed, we are able to learn about other parts of the world
where different development experiences have taken place and where
there are
different attitudes and approaches to women's rights.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
But to what extent does this represent a real benefit? In Nicaragua the
technological revolution has only just begun. Saying that though, here
you often
find that in very poor homes, the house might be falling down, but,
thanks to consumerism, there is the brand new TV. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So yes it benefits us in certain ways, but at the same time there are a
lot of negative effects. Because a lot of the time we end up getting
addicted to forms of media that stigmatize women, that make us believe
women should be a certain way. Because even in developed countries like
yours women are made to feel they should conform to a certain prototype
in order to be acceptable to the patriarchy, to fulfil male
ideals. This is why I talk about the capitalist model being double
edged. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The ALBA development model</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Now let's talk about the
other development model, the ALBA model. To what extent do you think
this model negatively or positively affects the position of women here?
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
MS: Personally, I want to acknowledge this government['s efforts in
this sense]. In the last study I carried out, details emerged about the
benefits felt by women as a result of government programs like Zero
Usury and others. <br>
      <br>
Like I said earlier, however, more work needs to be done in terms of
broadening the educative scope of these programs. For example with the
Zero Usury program - and I know this because my mother was benefited by
Zero Usury - they give you the money but they don't teach you how to
make good use of it. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This program could represent an opportunity to discuss what gender
equality is about, to talk about why the program exclusively benefits
women. Because gender equality isn't just about being able to say "we
gave 50 loans to men and 50 loans to women."<br>
      <br>
So I do think the educational side of this model is lacking, and
education represents the most important part of the beginning of any
transformation process. <br>
      <br>
Yes, this new model is benefiting a lot of women but I think it is
necessary that the government also invests in training programs, gender
awareness programs, programs that follow up and measure the extent to
which these government programs effectively facilitate progress in
terms of gender equality.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The position of women in
Nicaragua since the FSLN came to power </span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Looking beyond the specific
programs that you mention, which of course are very important, and
which the government talks about a lot. Taking into account social,
cultural and economic realities, have you observed a significant change
in the position of women within Nicaragua during the last three years
since the alternative ALBA development model began being implemented
here?&nbsp; <br>
      </span><br>
MS: There are more opportunities for women now. Now one sees more women
setting up small businesses. One sees more women involved in social
programs. In the health system there are more benefits for women. Now,
within the health system, women are not seen only as a mother-child
binomy like before. Now women have greater access to sexual and
reproductive health care. <br>
      <br>
It is premature, though, to evaluate whether or not there has been a
significant change. I acknowledge the government's intention [to bring
about that sort of change]. I like the discourse used by Rosario
Murillo [first lady and the government's main spokesperson] concerning
gender issues. It is very specific.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>I
just hope the positive policies, the legislation offering equal
opportunities, the&nbsp; Institute for Women effectively reach the
grass roots, that they ready the places where the penalization [of
therapeutic abortion] has seriously affected trust [in the
government].&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This polemic [about therapeutic abortion] has created a sort of
ongoing&nbsp; public showdown [between the government and] certain
feminist leaders. And as a result, the government's collaboration [with
the defence of women's rights] is not something that is particularly
easy to find information about. <br>
      <br>
In order to do that you have to work at a truly grass roots level in
order to listen directly to the female voices that say "I'm not
Sandinista but I like what the government is doing for my neighbour,"
or "I like what the government is doing for me." <br>
      <br>
In my opinion, analysis of perception via grass roots transversal education within these government programs are vital.&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
I know the government has good intentions. For example the Health
Ministry has just begun to implement a training program for all its
staff which aims to increase the quality and humanity with which
patients are treated. <br>
      <br>
I really believe in educational processes. I have worked for many years
in educational processes and in fact I, myself, am proof that
educational processes make you change for the better. [They provoke]
positive changes involving your personal development, your family and
your community. ...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feminicide in Nicaragua - can an
increase in this sort of murder be prevented?</span><br>
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: A final question, Marcia,
and it's about a very specific issue - feminicide. Feminicide has
become pretty much an every day occurrence in other Central American
countries like Guatemala and El Salvador, which of course represents a
tragedy for women and for society as a whole in those countries. I
think Nicaragua has the lowest feminicide rate in the region but there
are several social, cultural and other factors that make it possible,
if not probable, that the number of this sort of murders will increase
in the future.&nbsp; </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Do you think it will be
possible to prevent feminicide becoming an everyday occurrence here in
Nicaragua? And what should a strategy to prevent such an outcome
involve? </span><br>
      <br>
MS: Of course I think that we can do something against this phenomenon
in Nicaragua. Proof of that is the fact that on many occasions [the
women's movement] has been able to mobilize large numbers of people
against cases of such extreme violence - [feminicide represents] the
maximum expression of violence against women.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
I think that the strategy is to continue [doing what we have been
doing]. I say continue because many organizations are already doing
relevant work. I myself coordinated a project to increase awareness
among media workers about how to cover this sort of news story, about
how not to sensationalize this sort of story, about how to present the
story in such a way that viewers are encouraged to reflect on and
reject such atrocious violence against women, and to learn a new
attitude [towards violence]. I think it is necessary to continue
working with the media in this sense.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
I think it is important for institutions to coordinate between and
among themselves to continue this process. Often the law obliges
government institutions to create inter-institutional commissions and
carry out actions on issues like gender violence, but a lot of the time
institutions don't actually do it. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Another important aspect of the strategy would be to work directly with
key players like judges, prosecuting lawyers, the police, judicial
aids, the women's commissariat - the individuals responsible for
carrying forward criminal prosecutions relating to this sort of murder.
      <br>
      <br>
And when I talk about working with them, the first thing to do is to
approach them on a personal level and ensure, or work towards ensuring,
that these individuals actually acknowledge that feminicide is a
reality. Let's not get complacent about this - I don't know if you
remember last year when the Head of the Women's Commissariat in Diriomo
was murdered by the partner.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So this is why I insist on transversal education, education inherent to
all processes. Only with education will we be able to overcome this
sort of situation.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
I am not against male officials being placed in key positions, but the
government or the entities responsible for electing family judges and
juries should elect people who have a very high level of awareness
about the issues involved, people who have been trained in these
issues. This is especially important in remote places like Nueva Guinea
and Río Blanco where [feminicide] is becoming more common and
where access to justice is a lot more difficult especially for the most
vulnerable - the women.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So I think that with a strategy, with a plan, it is possible to prevent
an increase of feminicide. But this type of plan will require financial
resources in order to be carried out. It is necessary, therefore, for
the government to invest in this sort of strategy.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A weak women's movement has
meant less support for the real problems faced by Nicaraguan women</span><br>
      <br>
And that is where I think [the women's movement] has made mistakes, too
much time and effort has been spent contradicting what the government
says. This is why I feel a bit disillusioned with the women's movement
in Nicaragua. I feel the movement has become too involved in opposing
the government. They don't prioritize real problems enough.&nbsp;
&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Nowadays the movement's leaders don't talk about feminicide. They don't
talk about sexual abuse. I don't hear them talk about these things any
more. I feel that they are too involved in making political opposition
to the government. I hope they forgive me for saying it, but this is
the impression I get. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
There is no real inventory of what the women's movement thinks should
be forced onto the political agenda these days. The movement should be
willing to sign specific conventions with whichever government is in
power without becoming involved in party politics so that these
conventions become institutionalized and can benefit all Nicaraguan
women. <br>
      <br>
I think that the women's movement and the Women's Network Against
Violence should put their loyalty to a specific party behind them and
work towards greater political awareness of the day to day reality of
ordinary Nicaraguan women. <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
We should get out onto the streets more, we should start to talk about
the real problems faced by women again, like we used to do. It was in
this way that we achieved so much in the past.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The fact that the women's movement has stopped regular accompaniment of
victims is unjustifiable. Did you hear about the case of a women
murdered by her husband in San Francisco Libre? He was a butcher. He
was called Chacal.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The murder took place about four years ago. He dismembered her, he
carved her up. And it was a struggle to get the justice system to
categorize the crime as a brutal murder as opposed to ordinary
homicide. <br>
      <br>
He was given 25 years. Then, last year his sentenced was reduced to 20
years. And very recently his defence lawyer appealed to the National
Assembly for his client to be pardoned and the sentence to be reduced
to six years.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
But the victim's family found out he was on the list of convicts
requesting sentence reduction. They protested and achieved sufficient
pressure to prevent the Assembly voting in favour of the criminal.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But I remember seeing the family all alone in their protests - the
women's movement wasn't there with them, the Women's Network Against
Violence wasn't there. <br>
      <br>
So I think we need to return to the point when the movement showed
greater solidarity in order to pressurize more on day to day issues, so
that we are taken into account, so that we can say that what we are
fighting for is real.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Thank you, Marcia. Is there
anything else you would like to add?</span><br>
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">The women's movement needs a change of
leadership </span><br>
      <br>
MS: I'd like to thank you for taking my comments into account. Like I
said I have been talking from my personal point of view, I have
presented by own opinions. <br>
      <br>
For many years I have worked with organizations like Ixchen and the
Women's Network Against Violence, and I still coordinate with them for
certain things - if they call me for example, or if the women I work
with in the barrios need help to arrange something. <br>
      <br>
And I should say that I felt optimistic that [the women's movement]
will be united again. And that doesn't mean that [the movement] should
become loyal to a certain party, to the FSLN - each individual is free
to think as she wishes. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
But I am in favour of a change of leadership within the movement so
that it can be more inclusive, so that more women involved in the
struggle can get involved in the movement, so that problems like
feminicide, domestic abuse and sexual abuse are forced onto the
national agenda, so that not only therapeutic abortion is mentioned as
something necessary, something relevant to the current context. Because
that has begun to feel like a manipulation of our rights. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Not including other issues
feels like a manipulation?</span><br>
      <br>
MS: The fact that others issue aren't included and that those issues
aren't seen as relevant [feels like a manipulation] - if the National
Assembly talks about something then the women's movement talks about
it, but the movement doesn't discuss it at a grass roots level, the
leaders of the Women's Network Against Violence gets involved in
political banter with different politicians. <br>
      <br>
This is why I think we have lost a lot of momentum, we have lost a lot
of time, the movement has stopped fighting for other sorts of
vindications, for other struggles that it should be supporting. We
would have made progress of many issues if it wasn't for this
situation. <br>
      <br>
I think that the movement should make a truce, sit down and talk with
the government, we should make plans in relation to the real problems
faced by Nicaraguan women. <br>
      <br>
According to an investigation I did [into sexual abuse in Nicaragua]
during the time we have been sitting here talking, ten girls or
teenagers might have been sexually abused in this country. So I think
it is of utmost priority that we insist, on a daily basis, that these
sorts of problems are acknowledged, that [people recognize] them as
real.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Civil society and the State need to sit down together and talk [about
these problems] because they are problems that involve society as a
whole. This is not just a women's problem, nor is it just the
government's problem, nor it is the women's movement's problem. This is
a problem of society as a whole. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
