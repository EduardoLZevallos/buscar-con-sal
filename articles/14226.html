<p><strong>REMARKS OF PRESENTATION OF LETTERS OF CREDENTIAL TO THE PERMANENT COUNCIL OF THE OAS</strong><br />
<br />
Friday 8th april, 2022.</p>

<p>Ambassadors and Representatives of the Governments of Our America, that make up this Organization.</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary General of the OAS.</p>

<p>Dear Citizens who join us in this Event.</p>

<p>This day, Friday, 8th April, our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, on behalf of the People of Nicaragua, attends in compliance with its manifest responsibility, as a State and Government that complies with the obligations derived from its signed commitments, to present the letter of credentials of the new Permanent Representative to the OAS, which are typical of these acts, before the plenary session of this organization, and having already delivered them to the Secretary General of this OAS, we thus comply with the provisions of the OAS Charter, especially regarding the procedures for these cases.</p>

<p>From Our Nicaragua, Blessed and Always Free, on behalf of Our Heroes and Martyrs, of the citizens whom with national pride raise their Flags, their dreams and their hopes, of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, and of our Revolutionary Government, we appear here today, with clarity before you, to affirm that we support with national vigor the defense of our Model of Life and the inalienable right to live our national sovereignty, in accordance with the criteria of the Motherland that our heroes have built for and from our identity. Each of these Parameters today, are even constitutional standards of compliance for all.<br />
However, although the right of each People to live in freedom, to be treated as equals within the framework of the regional norms that gave life to this organization, has been reiterated many times, the express Prohibition of not attacking sovereignties and the respect for the freedom of self-determination of peoples; that practice unfortunately has been exactly contrary to what is written.</p>

<p>In the face of devious and perverse media management, which due to its size, viciousness, financing, coverage and even justification; our voice has always been raised with dignity, decorum and civic consciousness; the Nicaraguan People are the perfect judge of the acts of Nicaraguans, and with that certainty, anyone can understand why Nicaragua is a Joyful, Productive, Builder, Doctor and Nurse, Educator, Respectful of the Rights of the Female Gender, courageous, and above all, a People committed with Peace, which is one of the most appreciated assets of our citizens.</p>

<p>We have found, in the daily lives of our citizens, that it is not the repeated lie, like the one we sometimes hear in these halls, it is not the lying platform of terrorist campaigns, like those shown to date by the supporting actors, conveniently financed by governments and destabilizing groups, it is not the multiple disqualifications that we suffer on a daily basis that makes us understand that the real reason for our unity as a people certainly is the realities that we have lived, observed and constructed among all the patriots of our country, which sustain our Truth. To be Sincere, is to be Powerful, Darío promulgated.</p>

<p>We have said, from the truth of proven history, that the OAS lent and mortgaged its nature as an Organ of American Integrationist Expression, to become a complacent instrument that justified,</p>

<p>promoted, and even carried out infamous acts against various peoples of our Continent; thus distancing itself of its main task of being an Organization that enforces and respects the Principles of International Law, mainly of Sovereign Equality, Independence, and Freedom of Self-determination.</p>

<p>This Organization has diligently been disapplying its own founding rule, becoming a sad instrument of aggression of the United States Government that has converted it into what would be known as the US Ministry of Colonies. Gone, to its own shame, is its First Article, which expressly highlights that the Organization of American States has no powers other than those expressly conferred by this Charter, with none of its provisions authorizing it to intervene in matters of the internal jurisdiction of the Member states.<br />
Nicaragua has always stated that it does not recognize itself as a colony of any foreign Power. It has manifested in many historical moments its inalienable conscience as a free and sovereign people, and has acted in accordance with that principle of life. This legitimate manifestation of dignity has cost us the suffering of military interventions, covert, semi-covert and openly directed armed aggression by the Yankee Empire or its European minions.</p>

<p>Our History is marked by struggle, and we have faced it from a conviction of justice and therefore, we have ALWAYS triumphed; because Truth and Reason Accompanied Sandino, and his Little Crazy Army, Carlos Fonseca and his monumental Work: The FSLN, facing Somoza's praetorian army, and Winning together with the People, that 19th of July, 1979. From The Heroic Defense of the Sandinista Popular Revolution of the 1980´s, against the US mercenary army, and recently from 2018 to our days, defeating its new army of Media, networks, Traffickers, violent assassins and groups embedded within US Government agencies, relying on the complicity of Puppet Governments in Europe and Latin America, unilaterally imposing Sanctions, Blockades and multiple measures of extortion.</p>

<p>Today we are here to reiterate, that we uphold our independence and Jurisdictional Sovereignty, to which we are entitled, we enforce and apply our Legislative sovereignty with our constitutional bodies, We elect and promote our Egalitarian democracy with full Gender equity, and high levels of citizen participation; Our Government exercises its actions, based on the commitments contracted with the people, through the instruments of consultation and direct participation of the communities. We affirm that the Liberty of our people is not transferable, that we are not a people or a star of any flag; our Blue and White unites and consolidates us, and our Sun, which illuminates us and never declines, observes us in Life and shines upon us in Struggle.</p>

<p>We thank those who share with us the respect for the rules of coexistence; we celebrate together the respect for each People, and we deplore those rulers, who from fear, cowardice, petty interest and even cynicism, mortgage their own sovereignty to attack other Peoples.</p>

<p>Nicaragua of Sandino, Darío, Andrés and Zeledón, together with thousands of immortal Heroes who offered their lives for Nicaragua, who today uphold the dignity of life for all, call upon us to encourage efforts for Peace, Unity and Integration and to reject war, death and perverse lies.</p>

<p>Peace, Unity and Sovereignty.</p>
