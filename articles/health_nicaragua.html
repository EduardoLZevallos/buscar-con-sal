On January 9th 2009 Health Minister Guillermo González presented the
final version of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.minsa.gob.ni/planificacion/varios/Politica%20Nacional%20de%20Salud%20MINSA%2011enero09.pdf">FSLN government's national health policy</a>. The
document contains an extensive analysis of the state of the nation's
health and of the severe problems facing the national health system as well
as an outline of the Sandinista government's priorities and aims as
part of what Minister González described as the proposed
"transformation" of the health care system in Nicaragua.<br>
<br>
A study carried out during 2007 and 2008 by MINSA with support from the
Pan American Health Organization (and cited as part of the presentation
of the National Health Policy) gives an idea of the extent to which the
health of the Nicaraguan population suffered as a result of the
effective privatization of the public health system and the other
failed social and economic policies implemented during previous neo
liberal governments. <br>
<br>
Persistent inherited structural deficiencies<br>
<br>
The study found that 58% of Nicaraguans are unable to access adequate
healthcare and treatment due to poverty and social exclusion from
health services. The Caribbean Coast regions (RAAN and RAAS), Jinotega,
Matagalpa and Río San Juan were identified as the areas where the
population has least access to medical attention. In general the
sectors of society least likely to get adequate treatment when ill are
those living in poverty, rural inhabitants, women and young people.<br>
<br>
The study also found that 20% of children under five years old suffer
from chronic malnutrition and 6.3% from severe chronic malnutrition.
The areas where the child population is most affected are the RAAN,
RAAS, Jinotega and Madriz. In general the peoples of the Caribbean
Coast regions were identified as the sector of Nicaraguan society with
the worst quality of life.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
A factor that&nbsp;aggravates the public health system's inability
to respond to the population's healthcare needs is the fact that 80% of
the working population have no health insurance and 90% of the elderly
population have no social security benefits.<br>
<br>
As part of the study a survey was carried out to determine the
frequency with which Nicaraguans tend to fall ill with common ailments
(mainly respiratory and gastric complaints). 38.2% of those surveyed
said they had been ill within the last 30 days.<br>
<br>
The kinds of diseases the population are likely to suffer depend to a
large extent on the area of the country they live in. For example, in
Managua 9% of the population has diabetes and 25% have high blood
pressure while the proportion of the population to suffer from these
two complaints is significantly lower in&nbsp;rural areas.<br>
<br>
A report by the former MINSA authorities in 2006 (and cited as part of
the National Health Policy) confirmed that the Aleman and Bolaños
administrations' health policy had indeed actively reduced access to
basic healthcare services. It was demonstrated as part of the report
that the number of family planning consultations, antenatal checkups
and checkups for children under five years old had gradually fallen
between 2000 and 2005. The number of vaccinations provided as part of
the public health system also decreased during the same period.<br>
<br>
The infrastructure and equipment inherited by the FSLN government as
part of the public health system is described in the Health Policy
document as "obsolete." As a result of the lack of&nbsp;capacity
and resources in local health centers,&nbsp;emergency rooms and
out-patient services in regional hospitals tend to be overwhelmed with
patients who should be receiving treatment&nbsp;locally.<br>
<br>
Finally, a nationwide analysis of medicine and medical services sales
shows that 61% of all spending on healthcare in Nicaragua in 2004 was
paid by the private sector (individuals, companies and NGOs), 28% by
the government and 11% as part of international aid programs.<br>
<br>
Transformation against the odds<br>
<br>
Faced with such adverse circumstances - a population afflicted with
abundant and complex health problems, a healthcare system near collapse
and limited financial resources - it is hard to imagine even the most
committed and capable team of experts transforming the healthcare
system in the short term. Nevertheless, that is what the MINSA
authorities say they are trying to do.<br>
<br>
As part of MINSA's mission to "provide medical attention to Nicaraguans
according to their needs, guaranteeing free and universal access to
healthcare services and promoting healthy practises and lifestyles that
contribute to improving the quality of life," the specific objectives
are:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">* to guarantee free
and universal access to integral healthcare services<br>
* to develop a national culture of preventing risks and protecting
health<br>
* to permanently improve the quality of health services in line with
the needs and expectation of the Nicaraguan population<br>
* to strengthen the model of citizen participation in activities that
contribute to the wellbeing of the population <br>
</div>
<br>
Among the specific aims outlined in the National Health Policy are:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">* to significantly
reduce surgery and external consultation waiting lists. <br>
*&nbsp;to create access to healthcare services for the most
vulnerable sectors of society <br>
* to implement the regionalization of the health system in the RAAN and
RAAS by empowering the health authorities in those regions<br>
</div>
<br>
The most obvious and crude way in which to begin to improve the public
health system is by increasing the health budget over and above any
overall increase in the general national budget. And the FSLN
government has implemented significant nominal increases since coming
to power in 2007 (see table below). Considered within the context of
the spiralling inflation registered over the last few years as a result
of the extremely volatile international economy situation, however, it
becomes clear that the real value of those nominal increases is
significantly reduced. <br><br>

<br>
Like in so many other areas of government institutional work, though,
the positive changes achieved by this government in the national health
system are the product not of a major increase of resources but of
better use of the resources available.<br>
<br>Progress through 2007 and 2008<br><br>
Details that suggest the government succeeded in significantly
increasing access to the public health system in 2007 and 2008 were
provided by President Daniel Ortega in his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.conamornicaragua.org.ni/DOCUMENTOS%202009/ENERO/INFORME%20DE%20PERSPECTIVAS%20SOCIALES%20TODO.pdf">2008 end of year report</a>
presented to the National Assembly on January 10th 2009.<br>
<br>
According to the President's report 49% more medical consultations took
place within the public health system in 2008 compared to 2006.
Simultaneously the amount of prescription medicines provided by public
hospitals and health centers free of charge increased by 87.3%, the
number of surgeries carried out increased by 46.5% and the number of
specialized medical tests increased by 52%.<br>
<br>During the same period, as part of the ALBA-funded Misión Milagro programme three specialized ophthamological hospitals were
built in (one in Managua, one in the RAAN and another in the RAAS).
Also during 2007 and 2008 fourteen health centers that had been
destroyed by Hurricane Felix in September 2007 were completely rebuilt
and equipped in the RAAN. Major infrastructure work and repairs were
carried out on 24 hospitals and health centers across the country and a
brand new regional hospital was built and equipped in Boaco.<br>
<br>
Partially completed construction work with completion dates for 2009
and 2010 include the construction of four new regional hospitals,
fourteen new health centers, two new "casas maternas" (refuge centers
for women from remote areas in the last stages of pregnancy) and major
infrastructural improvements in 16 hospitals and health centers.<br>
<br>
Much of the major construction work within the public health system has
been possible thanks to resources made available as a result of the
FSLN government's insistence on its sovereign right to control the
designation of foreign government aid. <br>
<br>
It is interesting to note that of the 82 construction and
infrastructural improvement projects listed above 35 are taking place
in towns and villages on the Caribbean Coast, in other words 43% of
major projects. This demonstrates the government's commitment to it's
aims of increasing access to healthcare for the populations of areas
where least access previously existed and of empowering the Caribbean
regional health authorities as part of an effort to regionalize
healthcare and contribute to the process of autonomy on the Caribbean
Coast. <br>
<br>
An example of how MINSA is literally taking medical attention to the
most vulnerable and excluded sectors of society in Managua is the
project Barrio Limpio, Barrio Saludable ("A Clean Neighbourhood is a
Healthy Neighbourhood") which is being carried out in collaboration
with the local authorities.<br>
<br>
This project consists of a mobile clinic and information center which
travels from marginalized barrio to marginalized barrio providing
healthcare services (consultations for children, adults and the
elderly, medicines, basic tests, medical and lifestyle information and
advice and even haircuts) free of charge. Simultaneous to the visit
from the mobile home the local CPC is encouraged to carry out
activities that contribute to better health in the neighbourhood like
collecting rubbish, cleaning the streets and drains and planting trees.<br>
<br>
Another example of how MINSA's new approach is taking health services
to the community and involving ordinary citizens are the wider, more participative yearly
vaccination campaigns introduced in 2007. During the last week of April
2009 over 12,000 vaccination points in barrios and rural communities
(normally casa comunales, school buildings or community member's homes)
functioned as vaccination and prevention centers where children,
pregnant women and elderly people recieved vaccinations, vitamin
tablets, parasite medicine and medical advice as appropriate.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
An example of how the community health brigades organized by MINSA are
contributing to the health of their local communities is the response
to the outbreak of dengue during the 2008 rainy season. Health workers,
teachers and community health brigades were able to visit 40% of
Nicaraguan homes, disinfecting water containers (in order to avoid the
reproduction of mosquitos) and giving basic advice about how to avoid
dengue infection. As a result of the massive nationwide campaign the
number of cases of dengue registered in 2008 was 30% lower than the
previous year.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Of course, while the government is serious about transforming the
health
system and dramatically improving the population's quality of life,
they have a lot of ground to make up. The extreme budget limitations,
produced by the
combination of a small and weak economy and the current international
economic situation, mean the government cannot advance its
transformation process nearly as fast as the precarious health of the
population requires. One is at once struck by the amount achieved so
far and frustrated that such hard times should accompany this change
that has been so long coming.</td>
