<p class="text-align-right"><strong><i>In memory of the teacher and humanist, Aldo Díaz Lacayo</i></strong></p>

<h3><i><b>The Most High prevents the Children of the Lowest from putting their curse on Nicaragua</b></i></h3>

<p><br />
In 2000, Nicaragua had reached the summit "democracy".<br />
<br />
There were no economic sanctions from the United States and the European Union.<br />
<br />
The country was not prey to the howls of rabid slander or distortions foaming out of from the baying pack of corporate media lies.<br />
<br />
Thinking of trade blockades was a sign of madness.<br />
<br />
It never occurred to the Sandinista Front to stage a coup d'état.<br />
<br />
The governments were never the victims of covert operations.<br />
<br />
Not a single barricade was set up for exterminating passers by.<br />
<br />
It was a society without no carnivorous "lambs".<br />
<br />
There were no grudges.<br />
<br />
Of course, whatever was everyone's business: the Western powers <b>gave Nicaragua full support for its time honored monotony of underdevelopment</b>.<br />
<br />
That stupendous "democracy" was summed up in a Nicaraguan life expectancy of 72 years.<br />
<br />
Today, at the "bottom of the abyss due to lack of democracy", as the hyper-right wing alleges, the citizen's lifespan is approaching 80 years of age, as confirmed by the World Bank in 2021.<br />
<br />
The average lifespan has not decreased, it has not stagnated. Nicaraguans get to see more calendars, and that would be more so if Nicaragua did not suffer foreign aggression.<br />
<br />
The panorama of "democracy" delivered to the Sandinista Front in 2007 exceeded the gloomy verdict: "<i>Nicaragua's economic situation is one of the worst in the Central American region"</i>. Back then a "<i>weak institutionality</i>" prevailed, and the exodus of Nicaraguans was of biblical proportions.<br />
<br />
No. This is not a declaration of the Sao Paulo Forum. This is what is stated in the document <i>"Health reform in Nicaragua", (CEPAL/ GTZ 2005)</i>. In addition, there was "<i>a weak tradition of transaction between the different groups that make up society</i>". As if that were not enough, "<i>the country's productive capacity is affected by a massive migration depriving it of its best human resources</i>".<br />
<br />
So for the chorus of crocodile mourners to come up with the pathetic story that the Sandinista Government has "<i>weakened institutionality</i>" and that its policies "<i>began</i>" the migratory flow, in fact abuses even the customary rotten codes of humbug.<br />
<br />
In that "<i>democracy</i>", "<i>About 90 percent of medical services went to less than 10 percent of the population: the ruling elite and an affluent middle class. Millions of people had no access to medical care.</i>"<br />
<br />
A the start of  2007, 48 percent of the country's population lived below the poverty line.<br />
<br />
Now "<i>without democracy</i>" poverty is 18 percent.<br />
<br />
Education, including even medical school is free and  academic merit has replaced the perverse personal networking of people.<br />
<br />
This was what US citizen Sara Flounders discovered, when she visited the country from October 3-10, 2021, as part of a delegation organized by the Alliance for Global Justice / Nica Network.<br />
<br />
Under pre-2007  "<i>democracy</i>", "<i>The poor report that the main reasons for not using social services are cost and distance</i>".<br />
<br />
This statement is not one by the Sandinista Front. It is the confession of a previous "<i>democratic</i>" government to a joint investigation by the World Bank and the MECOVI-Nicaragua program.<br />
<br />
In that splendid "<i>democracy</i>", "<i>Private social service costs have increased faster for the extreme poor, so although they have improved their access to such services, they face costs that can be prohibitive</i>".<br />
<br />
Private costs? What's all this about "<i>improving</i>" "prohibitive access"? Just official mumbo jumbo. This is how "<i>democracy</i>" measures "<i>the great social benefits</i>" charged to the people.<br />
<br />
Now "<i>without democracy</i>", quality health care is delivered practically into people's homes.<br />
<br />
The citizens of places once excluded from the social map, such as the department of Río San Juan, but very much included as an area neglected by those in power, now receive care in primary hospitals or health centers without paying a cent.<br />
<br />
The real Nicaragua offers examples like the one Prensa Latina reported on March 26, 2021: the primary hospital in the town of Los Chiles, "<i>The twentieth built by the administration of the Sandinista Front, will offer specialties including internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, anesthesiology, radiology, gynecology, nutrition, physiotherapy and care in natural medicine and complementary therapies.<br />
<br />
"It will also have equipment equipped with high technology such as a biosafety cabin, a digitalized X-ray system, a plasma defroster and an ultrasound electro-stimulator.</i>"<br />
<br />
Without the oligarchy's hired help of the oligarchy running the management, for the first time in 2007 the country's political-administrative division started turning into something more than merely a map and began to look like a real country : setting free from under-development the nation's 153 municipalities and its two Caribbean Autonomous Regions of the Caribbean. Nicaragua was no longer just Managua with everything else overgrown scrub. <span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> </span></p>

<p><b>II</b></p>

<p><br />
Under "<i>democracy</i>" the West is familiar with the word "<i>deplorable</i>". If anyone falls in then even hope enters its death throes.<br />
<br />
Now "<i>without democracy"</i>, Chinandega has a new luxury hospital, so much so that one of the patients under care there, Liliam Medrano from El Realejo, exclaimed to the Bank for Economic Integration, CABEI: "<i>It fills me with emotion knowing we don't have just a hospital, we have a hotel</i>".<br />
<br />
The organization that financed the US$51.87 million mega project, notes:<br />
<br />
"<i>More than 500,000 Nicaraguans in the western part of the country will be able to receive quality medical care in better conditions with the opening of the 'Dr. Mauricio Abdalah Hospital' in Chinandega. Due to its geographical position, it will cover the thirteen municipalities of Chinandega, including the most distant ones such as Cinco Pinos, San Pedro and San Francisco</i>".<br />
<br />
The bank's executive president, Dr. Dante Mossi, reported: "<i>We are pleased to see the realization of a first-world, inclusive and quality health facility, with an infrastructure of 35,000 square meters of construction and capacity to house 300 beds, 142 rooms, 8 operating rooms, 31 outpatient clinics, 16 day care units and 18 dialysis services, among others</i>".<br />
<br />
As if that were not enough, the recently opened national reference hospital consists of seven buildings housing all the services and support areas: outpatient services, day hospital, hemodialysis, pharmacy, medical-surgical, pediatric and gynecological-obstetrics hospitalization, emergencies, diagnostics, intensive care, neonatology, and an equipment and sterilization center.<br />
<br />
Under "<i>democracy</i>" in  2006, 34 machines were available providing hemodialysis to just 96 patients with chronic kidney disease. Everyone else needing the treatment, a huge number by the way, sought "<i>democratically</i>" how to survive.<br />
<br />
Now, "<i>without democracy</i>" or "<i>respect for human rights</i>", there are 332 hemodialysis machines serving 2,270 patients.<br />
<br />
In "<i>democracy</i>", 2006, an irrevocable death sentence hung over women, thanks to the "<i>champion defenders</i>" of "<i>human rights</i>", "<i>democratic values</i>" and other such labyrinthine cynical nonsense dripping from the rapacious maw of the Chamorro-Somocista vampires.<br />
<br />
And this is not some "<i>leftist diatribe</i>", but hard data portraying from head to toe the mediocrity of those who held power from 1990 to 2006: to diagnose deadly breast cancer there was only one mamograph in the whole country to treat 2 million 793 thousand 837 women!<br />
<br />
For God's sake, who in their right mind dares to call these regimes of death "<i>democracies</i>"?<br />
<br />
"<i>Without democracy</i>" in 2020 there are now 28 mamographs, apart from the 128 cryotherapy equipment (treatment that prevents cancer of the reproductive organs) and 97 colposcopes (to accurately see the cervix and discover changes in the cells that can also turn cancerous)<br />
<br />
With this equipment, women in 80 percent of the country's municipalities will be able to receive treatment free of charge, as President Daniel Ortega has explained.<br />
<br />
Under "<i>democracy</i>", Enrique Bolaños pocketed, along with his salary as Head of State, his pension as a former vice-president and too his allowances from the "transparency and anti-corruption commission", amounting to 19,310 dollars a month. That is, what a teacher earns in 25 years of hard work. This was reported in Ecuador's "El Universo" news outlet on June 9, 2003.<br />
<br />
And also, in the happy days of "<i>democracy</i>" - which some people lacking any love for their nation praise so much -, "<i>Nicaraguans suffer a critical economic situation, with 54% unemployment and underemployment and 70% of the population living in poverty, aggravated by the bad administration of previous governments</i>". The indictment was not signed by the Kremlin but printed by the same Guayaquil newspaper.<br />
<br />
Under "<i>democracy</i>", apart from the onerous fees charged to children to be able to attend primary and secondary schools, "<i>Malnutrition remains high, is geographically concentrated and appears to have changed little over the last decade, despite substantial spending on nutrition programs during the 1990s.<br />
<br />
"Nicaragua's social protection strategy needs to be further developed. With respect to existing programs, there does not appear to have been significant progress with the Government's commitment to the social policy matrix presented to the 1998 Consultative Group for Nicaragua in Geneva to rationalize the existing social assistance portfolio.</i>"<br />
<br />
This diagnosis that is not one from specialists of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, ALBA, but in fact corresponds to the file <i>"Nicaragua Poverty Report"</i> <i>(Latin American and Caribbean Sectoral Office for Poverty Reduction and Economic Management, 2001.)</i><br />
<br />
Now "<i>without democracy</i>", primary school children, with no exceptions, receive free school meals.<br />
<br />
Under "<i>democracy</i>", only 53% of the national territory had electricity so as to enjoy suffering constant power cuts. The environment was excessively polluted with practically exclusively fossil fuel based electricity generation. The now very concerned "<i>environmental champions</i>", all the while they held power, disdained investing even one cent in clean energy.<br />
<br />
"<i>Without democracy</i>", the electricity grid now is truly national, bringing light to 99% of Nicaraguan homes in Nicaragua's 130,000 plus square kilometers. Where there's no grid, solar panels are installed. Dependence on oil is reduced. Renewable energies from geothermal to wind energy are being developed.<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.64cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">And if the supremacists didn't bully the nation....<br />
<br />
If they didn't strangle their economy with sanctions....<br />
<br />
If they did not finance hatred...<br />
<br />
If they didn't endorse egomaniac traitors....<br />
<br />
If they dropped systematic character assassination....<br />
<br />
If the corporate false witness industry would stop censoring the truth and quit slandering the nation so as to scare away investors and tourists....<br />
<br />
If the wolves disguised as lambs (a trite but commonplace truth) stopped spreading poison...<br />
<br />
If the racist Donald Trump in 2019 had not declared Nicaragua an "unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. National Security and foreign policy"<br />
<br />
If he had not sponsored the failed criminal coup attempt of April-July 2018....<br />
<br />
If only all Hell were not let loose against Nicaragua for the "<i>crime</i>" of exercising its sovereignty....<br />
<br />
If only they would leave the country alone once and for all....<br />
<br />
Lord Yahweh: where would Nicaragua be today?<br />
<br />
Because it is not the Most High who has sought to overthrow Nicaragua, since if that were the case, not even 10 rods of road would have been opened, and in fact in Nicaragua there are more roads, the best roads in Central America and ranked the fifth best of all the road networks in Latin America; instead of sad streets without even a gutter, we have the most formidable bridges and overpasses we've ever seen, and far beyond the neoliberal fantasies of any aspiring MBA, feasibility studies for the country's South Caribbean<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> deep water port have been prepared by the Dutch firm Arcadis.<br />
<br />
If God wanted to tear down this Republic, not a single empty health post would have been built, but here more than a few health centers we have monumental hospital complexes with state-of-the-art technology, with others under construction.<br />
<br />
His Word is true: <i>"If he knocks a thing down, there is no rebuilding; if he imprisons, there is no release. He holds back the waters and there is drought; he sends them forth and they overwhelm the land."</i> Job, 12:14-15.<br />
<br />
And here it is, and the hour is now, when more has been built, more has been constructed, more has been assured for the future, and not one development plan has dried up but instead have rejuvenated, because thanks to the rivers of living water of the Mighty One of Israel, more has been done in these few years than what has been done since April 30, 1838, when Nicaragua symbolically became a Republic.<br />
<br />
God, in the name of Jesus, does not consecrate symbols, idols, forms, shadows, echoes, reflections or appearances. God glorifies truths, realities and the content of Peace.<br />
<br />
God blesses the great event of finally moving the National History: to be the State of Nicaragua, Free, Independent, Sovereign. And it is not some Sandinista "<i>affair</i>": rather it is a National Demand.<br />
<br />
The curses that the Children of the Lowest have uttered against Nicaragua, will fall only on their own heads...<br />
<br />
And the mitred priests of Balaam know this very well.<br />
<br />
For they also, like that false prophet, loved the wages of wickedness more than the rewards of Truth.</span></p>
