<h3><em><strong>Remarks during a debate on Nicaragua held by the Rochester Committee on Latin America</strong></em></h3>

<p>Tonight the debate is about the recent violence in Nicaragua.  I’ll make this point at the beginning:  What happened in Nicaragua was a coup attempt.  The coup attempt was carefully planned by the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy and the Nicaraguan right wing.  Their goal was to overthrow the legal government of Nicaragua, and they failed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the coup leaders were able to set the agenda for news about the conflict.  They were very good at it.  “Evil government forces repressing unarmed students.”  This basic narrative got picked up by the right-wing media and then became the mainstream media story of the events in Nicaragua.  However, the problem is that it wasn’t true!</p>

<p>In fact, the narrative actually started out with a lie.  We were told that an innocent, peaceful student protester was killed on April 18th in Managua.  In reality, no protester was killed on April 18th.  It was a complete fabrication.</p>

<p>To step back, I want to describe some of the social and economic progress that Nicaragua had made since President Ortega’s took office in 2007.  </p>

<p>Nicaragua had the second highest economic growth rates and the most stable economy in Central America.  </p>

<p>Nicaragua is the Latin American country with the greatest reduction of extreme poverty.  </p>

<p>Nicaragua did not contribute to the migrant exodus to the US, unlike the desperate people of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  Why not?  Because Nicaraguans didn’t have to flee from either gang violence, government repression, or from hunger!</p>

<p>OK—so what were the so-called peaceful protesters protesting?  The stated reason for the protests was a change in the Social Security law.  Do you really believe that students would stage major protests about changes in the Social Security law?  What students do you know who could care that much about what the social security law will be in 2058?</p>

<p>The protests were called for and directed by COSEP, which in English is the Superior Council for Private Enterprise.  In other words, the Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce, only worse.  COSEP is aligned with the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy.  The overarching goal of the National Endowment for Democracy is to “provide a coordinated strategy and media voice for opposition groups in Nicaragua.”  That’s exactly what they did.</p>

<p>Since 2014, the NED has given $4.4 million dollars to groups in Nicaragua.  The people trained by NED were able to shape and control public opinion on Facebook in the five days from April 18th to April 22nd.  Their messages, full of lies, triggered violent protests across the country.</p>

<p>The violence in Nicaragua was terrible.  For three months armed right-wing gangs roamed the streets.  (Most of the students left the protests when they understood that they were being manipulated by the right wing.  When they saw the people protesting next to them, the realized that they were thugs and hooligans.)  These armed thugs put up the barricades—called tranques in Spanish—which prevented people from traveling from city to city, and even from traveling from their homes to their work.  </p>

<p>These roadblocks were centers of terror.  If you were a coup supporter, you were OK.  If you weren’t a coup supporter, you were often shaken down for money, robbed, beaten, and even killed.</p>

<p>Why didn’t the police protect the people?  Because the police were ordered to stay in their barracks.  Why were the police ordered to stay in their barracks?  Because every time the police showed up to do their job the video recording began, and the same narrative was presented: armed police and paramilitaries are slaughtering innocent, unarmed student protesters.</p>

<p>At least 200 people died because of the coup attempt.  The leaders of the coup claimed that all of them were killed by the government.  Does that make any sense?  As it turned out, almost exactly half of the people were killed by protesters and the other half were killed by people loyal to the government.  If there hadn’t been a coup attempt, all those people would be alive today.</p>

<p>The coup forces caused enormous damage: They burned down 60 government buildings.  They attacked schools, hospitals, and health centers.  They ruined 55 ambulances.  Destruction was everywhere.  Do you really believe that so much destruction could be caused by peaceful, unarmed protesters?</p>

<p>At this point, I want you to think about what I’ve said so far.  Then think about Guatemala in 1954, think about the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba in 1961, think about the invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965, think about the coup in Chile in 1973, think about the Contra war in Nicaragua in the 1980’s, think of the coup in Honduras in 2009.  What do all these events have in common?  They have in common the bloody hands of the U.S. government overthrowing progressive Latin-American governments.  Then ask yourself, “Why should the coup attempt in Nicaragua be any different?”  It’s the same game plan, just managed in a slightly different fashion which was made possible by advances in technology.</p>

<p>I’ll remind you that the coup leaders didn’t call for any social or economic reforms, which at least would have made sense.  They either called for President Ortega’s resignation or they called for early elections in 2019 instead of 2021.  </p>

<p>Why should President Ortega resign?  He received 72 percent of the vote in 2016.</p>

<p>In regard to early elections, I looked at the constitution of Nicaragua, and here’s what it says:</p>

<p>Article 148 • Term length of Head of State The President and the Vice President shall exercise their functions for a period of five years counting from their assuming office on the tenth of January of the year following their election.  </p>

<p>President Ortega was inaugurated on January 10, 2017.  The next president of Nicaragua will be inaugurated on January 10, 2022.  It would be unconstitutional for President Ortega to declare an early election.  The President of Nicaragua serves for five years, not three.</p>

<p>Now you have to decide which narrative to believe.  Did the respected Nicaraguan police turn into the vicious Honduran police on April 18th?  Were the armed thugs at the tranques truly peaceful protesters?  Is the U.S. government innocent, or was the U.S. government again guilty of attempting to overthrow a progressive government in Latin America?</p>
