<p align="center" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><em><strong><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The CIA, NSA, FBI and DOD are your “friends” on Facebook</font></span></strong></em></h3>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Social media and Google serve three strategic purposes for the United States government. First, they allow Washington to conduct espionage; second, they facilitate the spread of disinformation campaigns, and third, they serve as conduits for the transmission of social contagions. In deploying thought control against the users of social media and Google, the US government regulates civil unrest both domestic and abroad. As such, social media and Google can best be understood as unconventional weapons (UW). In this capacity, they can be used in proxy wars against the governments of non-compliant Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) nations to accomplish regime change.</font></span><br />
 </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Through geopolitical manipulations that eliminate opposition, the United States government can actualize the ruling elites’ vision of a corporate controlled global economy without the deployment of troops. This model of “non-violence” or “soft-coup” as a method of unconventional warfare can be traced to Gene Sharp and the Albert Einstein Institution. It is organized through the efforts of the NGOs it oversees such as Freedom House and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). And, it can be observed in the various Color Revolutions that occurred in Eastern European countries, the Middle East and now Latin America.</font></span><br />
 </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:1.27cm; margin-bottom:0cm"><em><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The NED is the coordinating Washington <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.globalresearch.ca/egypt-s-revolution-creative-destruction-for-a-greater-middle-east/23131/amp">agency for regime destabilization</a> and change. It is active from Tibet to Ukraine, from Venezuela to Tunisia, from Kuwait to Morocco in reshaping the world after the collapse of the Soviet Union into what George H.W. Bush in a 1991 speech to Congress proclaimed triumphantly as the dawn of a New World Order.”</font><sup> </sup></span></em></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><br />
<span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Within this context, activists and the NAM must consider Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google hostile territory that is ultimately controlled by the United States Intelligence Community (IC) and the Department of Defense (DoD). Despite user-friendly packaging and attractive advertisements, social media and Google remain militarized programs. As such, activists and NAM users must enter with caution, prepared to do battle to win at PSYOPS in cyber warfare.</font></span><br />
 </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Using the US DoD model, cyber warfare can be upgraded to a department on par with the NAM armed forces. In this regard, Polytechnic universities are strategic and can be controlled by NAM governments and their operatives, as they are in the US by the IC and DoD</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">. NAM military institutions <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a12814064/spy-school-daniel-golden-fbi-cia-recruit-at-american-colleges/">can recruit cyber warfare teachers/activists</a>, develop educational curriculum, set career paths and train cyber soldiers to counter US engagements. Useful information can be taken directly from any of the US military’s cyberspace recruitment sites, which promise to develop capabilities to defend national security as well as to <a href="https://fas.org/irp/doddir/usaf/cyberwarops.pdf">create effects in cyberspace</a> to achieve national objectives.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The first step for the NAM is to create public awareness of the threat that social media possesses to protect users and the NAM governments against its influence. In doing so, a cadre of civilian cyber PSYOP content monitors can be created. Additionally, software is now commercially available that can search, monitor, analyze and manage social media content. Presently, large corporations as well at the IC and DoD are using this social media software - since it is useful in business marketing strategies. NAM governments can deploy this software in their communication offices. Through vigilance, PSYOP efforts against NAM governments by social media and Google can be thwarted.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Concurrently, it is critical to guard against cyber invasion through the passing of cyber laws with strong penalties, as done by Germany with its groundbreaking Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG). Also, it is key to ensure through news media communications that workers in the IT industry understand the ramifications of the work in which they engage as well the nefarious intent of their respective employers. The “Never Again Pledge” taken by US tech workers in 2017 is promising.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Germany’s Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG)</b></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Germany has blazed a trail for the NAM against PSYOPS in social media with its Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15852048/germany-hate-speech-facebook-twitter-fine-censorship">setting of fines</a> of up to $50 million euros.</font><sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><a class="sdendnoteanc" href="3828.html#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc" id="sdendnote2anc"><sup>ii</sup></a></font></sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> The NAM must immediately follow suit with the <a href="https://m.facebook.com/help/1807845469513149?helpref=hc_fnav">setting of robust laws </a>and fines against: the dissemination of propaganda; the encouragement of violent offences endangering the state; treasonous forgery; public incitement to crime; breaching of the public peace by threatening to commit offences; the forming of criminal or terrorist organizations.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Never Again Pledge</b></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">As reported by the New Yorker in its March 14, 2017 article titled: Why Protesters Gathered Outside Peter Thiel’s Mansion This Weekend, a group of about fifty tech workers, attorneys and anti-surveillance activists stood outside the home of Peter Thiel. Thiel is co-founded of Palantir Technologies, a Trump advisor, and was Facebook’s first investor. He remains a board member of Facebook as well as a member of the <a href="http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/steering-committee.html">Bilderberg Steering Committee</a>. The protest was organized to bring attention to software developed by Plantir called Investigative Case Management that is used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for mass deportation. Amongst other data sources to identify and track a given target, it uses social media content.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Since the presidential election, nearly three thousand tech workers signed the Never Again Pledge, promising to not work on databases that the Trump Administration might use to target vulnerable groups. The name is a nod to I.B.M.’s alleged role, during the Second World War, in systematizing Nazi genocide by providing punch-card technology.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">To understand the US governments offensive against unfavorable NAM regimes, it is important to understand two things: first, the origin of Facebook and Google; and second, the influence they collectively wield over human motivation through coercion and the spread of social contagions through distorted reality. Within this context, it is of primary concern that activists become adept at the stealth guerilla tactic of hit-and-run, as flexibility and anonymity become key to survival. With the stakes of financial ruin, imprisonment and death so high under the USA Patriot Act, no dissident remains safe.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>USA Patriot Act</b></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">As dissent and protest both international and domestic becomes increasingly illegal in the United States, and the governmental powers to investigate “terrorism” expand and morph under the USA Patriot Act, activists and the NAM must develop and foster skill sets that protect sympathetic Internet hosts, contributors and content against attack wherever they reside. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/surveillance-under-usapatriot-act">the Patriot Act</a> increases the government’s surveillance powers in four areas:</font></span><br />
 </p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Records searches. It expands the government's ability to look at records on an individual's activity being held by a third party. (Section 215) </font></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:1.27cm; margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<ol start="2">
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Secret searches. It expands the government's ability to search private property without notice to the owner. (Section 213) </font></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:1.27cm; margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Intelligence searches. It expands a narrow exception to the Fourth Amendment that had been created for the collection of foreign intelligence information (Section 218). </font></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:1.27cm; margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<ol start="4">
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">"Trap and trace" searches. It expands another Fourth Amendment exception for spying that collects "addressing" information about the origin and destination of communications, as opposed to the content (Section 214).</font></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Accordingly, as described by the ACLU:</font></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The government no longer has to show evidence that the subjects of search orders are an "agent of a foreign power," a requirement that previously protected Americans against abuse of this authority. </font></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:1.27cm; margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The FBI does not even have to show a reasonable suspicion that the records are related to criminal activity, much less the requirement for "probable cause" that is listed in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. All the government needs to do is make the broad assertion that the request is related to an ongoing terrorism or foreign intelligence investigation. </font></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:1.27cm; margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Judicial oversight of these new powers is essentially non-existent. The government must only certify to a judge - with no need for evidence or proof - that such a search meets the statute's broad criteria, and the judge does not even have the authority to reject the application.</font></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Surveillance orders can be based in part on a person's First Amendment activities, such as the books they read, the Web sites they visit, or a letter to the editor they have written. </font></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left:1.27cm; margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">A person or organization forced to turn over records is prohibited from disclosing the search to anyone. As a result of this gag order, the subjects of surveillance never even find out that their personal records have been examined by the government. That undercuts an important check and balance on this power: the ability of individuals to challenge illegitimate searches.</font></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The ACLU also describes non-surveillance provisions in the Act, which remain the most serious as they enable the indefinite detention of non-citizens without trial. The provisions:</font></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Give the Director of Central Intelligence the power to identify domestic intelligence requirements. As the director is appointed by the president, this extraordinary unchecked executive power opens the door to the same abuses that took place in the 1970s and before, when the CIA engaged in widespread spying on protest groups and other Americans. </font></span><br />
	 </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Create a new crime of "domestic terrorism." The Patriot Act transforms protesters into terrorists if they engage in conduct that "involves acts dangerous to human life" to "influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion." The words “influence” and “coercion” have a wide range of meanings and allow for unbridled discretion. Furthermore, the law gives the attorney general and the secretary of state the power to detain or deport any non-citizen who belongs to or donates money to a broadly defined "domestic terrorist" group. </font></span><br />
	 </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Allow for the indefinite detention of non-citizens. The attorney general can order detention based on a certification that he or she has "reasonable grounds to believe" a non-citizen endangers national security. Tangible proof is not a requirement, only a “reasonable belief”. Worse yet, if the foreigner does not have a country that will accept them, they can be detained indefinitely without trial.</font></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>US News Media: Counterpunch, Alice Donovan &amp; the FBI </b></font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">On December 25, 2017, a troubling article appeared in Counterpunch, a US media news outlet, regarding the writing of an <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/07/27/alice-donovan-russiagate-and-the-rabbit-hole-of-sanctimony/">alleged journalist/Russian troll</a>, Alice Donovan. </font><font face="Times New&#10;        Roman, serif"> Links to an additional article appeared on Counterpunch’s Facebook page on July 27, 2018.</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> Overall, the articles allege Donavan is either an unimaginative writer that committed plagiarism as a sport, or that she is a Russian troll. However, <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/12/25/go-ask-alice-the-curious-case-of-alice-donovan-2/">Donavan’s transgressions</a> and intent are irreve</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">la</font><font face="Times New&#10;        Roman, serif">nt, what the story revealed in all its gory horror is how the US government concocts justifications to learn the identity and location of a given dissident, and how easily it scared an independent and alternative US news media outlet into become its slobbering accomplice.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In this case, the FBI alleged Donovan was a Russian agent that spread disinformation in the Clinton/Trump presidential campaign with the intent of effecting the national election, despite the fact that she did not submit articles specifically on Clinton or Trump. What the US government’s fishing expedition also revealed is that all US news media can’t be trusted, even ones with cute sounding reactionary names, such as Counterpunch. As Counterpunch not only admitted to bending over backwards to cooperate with the FBI, it also proudly declared its decision to up-the-ante and conduct its own investigation and exposé. Counterpunch analyzed the transmission times and IP address of Donovan’s submission emails; it included photos of the alleged Alice Donovan from other media sources in its articles about her; it interviewed other news media that hosted Donovan’s articles, and most outrageously actually asked Donovan to call them by phone and send a photo of her utility bill disclosing her physical location. Without surprise, Donovan declined both requests stating: “security reasons.” If there was ever a reason to give up US hosted media, write under a nom de plume, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), and accept payment only in crypto currency, this is it!</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">As anyone honestly committed to telling the truth will explain, it’s not about the messenger; it’s about the message. Under the Patriot Act, writers are safer in anonymity. But as anyone committed to telling the truth will also explain, when you eliminate one activist, ten are energized to take their respective place. Contrary to what PSYOPS wants the 99 percent to believe, there is strength in numbers. While imperialist greed through big payoffs may make for fast friendships, the shared love of truth and justice is priceless. It engenders a loyalty so strong it overcomes setbacks and hardship. </font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Having just returned from Nicaragua two weeks earlier, after spending two peaceful months in San Juan Del Sur, I was shocked at the sudden and widespread vitriol controlling my newsfeed. First, I read how the government was corrupt in making changes to their social security system, and then I read how the government was murdering protestors. I knew from my understanding of Nicaragua’s history; President Ortega’s longstanding commitment to the country; its highly successful model of community policing; and the international context Nicaragua is forced to operate in due to repressive IMF loans and trade agreements, that there was more to this story.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Yet, there was no analysis anywhere to be found, only baseless accusations from predominantly white men and an occasional white woman living in Miami, Texas and Costa Rica. A number of Latinos from various locations in the United States later joined in the chatter claiming they were born in Nicaragua and thus justified in posting hostilities, when engaged in debate.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Property owners I personally knew also spoke against the government and joined in with inflammatory remarks. It is important to understand that President Ortega and the FSLN did not conduct purging campaigns to remove its bitter rightwing enemies/Somozistas. Under President Ortega’s compassionate and practical leadership, Nicaragua even forgave the Contras that its FSLN fought against once they agreed to lay down their arms.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Everywhere I looked <a href="https://grayzoneproject.com/2018/06/19/ned-nicaragua-protests-us-government/">the message of hate was the same</a>, be it Facebook, Twitter or mainstream news media from the mouths of rightwing senators Marco Rubio and Ileana Ross-Lehtinen who staged meetings with protestors</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> as well as alternative media such as Democracy Now and the Guardian. The understated president, Daniel Ortega, went from being an astute and beloved aged revolutionary hero to a merciless dictator in social media and the press within a few hours. The news feed was so similar, overwhelming, relentless and well packaged, that it seemed immediately like an expertly orchestrated massive disinformation campaign set by the imperial United States to remove President Ortega and the FSLN from office yet again.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Anytime I questioned the prevailing narrative on the Facebook expatriate groups, 10 to 15 users, with questionable profiles, ganged up on me. I was personally insulted, told to remove my posts, and threatened. They feared my comments. Additionally, my Facebook friends were contacted and insulted and told to “make me remove my posts”. I received phone calls on Facebook Messenger despite the fact that my friend’s list is hidden.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The questionable profiles that contacted me often listed present employment with an obscure non governmental organization (NGO), and/or prior employment with the US State Department, US military, or in one case a user listed his job as a “private investigator” that just returned from “doing security in Venezuela.”</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><br />
<span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Yet, what was most troubling to me was that people I knew from San Juan Del Sur were brainwashed by the massive and unrelenting wave of disinformation. PSYOPS temporarily worked. They began repeating hostile catch phrases against the government as if it was Holy Scripture. They would not read or watch anything in favor of the government, despite my best efforts through verbal and written communication. They made up their minds, based on social media and Google’s distorted reality, that revolution was what the majority of people in Nicaragua wanted. This distortion couldn’t be farther from the truth, as President Daniel Ortega was elected with over 70 percent of the vote. However, the barrage of repeating fake propaganda videos resulted in social contagion frenzy, similar to that experienced by the Arab students in Egypt. </font></span></p>

Fortunately, distorted reality can only last a short time. </font></span></p>

So, I found a close-up photo online that corresponded with the fake name I used to open my Facebook account, and uploaded it hoping for the best. It worked. I had access to my profile by the next morning. However, I continue to wonder if Facebook was fooled or if I am merely being given more opportunity to violate the Patriot Act in thought and word? Are my CIA, NSA, FBI and DoD “friends” continuing their surveillance of my personal communications on Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp applications just more closely? Under the Patriot Act, Facebook is mostly prohibited from disclosing law enforcement surveillance.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><br />
<span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In early 1999, with funding directed by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), input from Silicon Valley consultants and Norman Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed-Martin, In-Q-It, a non-profit corporation was formed. Its core mission to improve the data collection and analysis capabilities of the CIA through access and control over emerging Information Technology (IT) remains intact to date. By March of 1999, the corporation received its first contract. In 2000, its name was changed to In-Q-Tel (IQT).</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">IQT invests in areas where there is both a CIA need and private sector interest. Examples of commercial applications that also support intelligence functions are: data warehousing and mining, knowledge management, profiling search agents, geographic information systems, imagery analysis and pattern recognition, statistical data analysis tools, language translation, targeted information systems, mobile computing, and secure computing.</font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"> </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Though IQT, the CIA has the option of purchasing products directly from the vendor or launching Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) projects. While IQT’s present budget remains secret, its first year budget was $28 million. According to a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/in-q-tel-a-glimpse-inside-the-cias-venture-capital-arm">2013 Fox Business News report, IQT claims</a> that for every dollar it invests in a company, the venture community invests over $9.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">R&amp;D remains the core of its activities. Sometimes IQT assembles teams of companies to create the solution it seeks; other times it is a co-investor in a fledgling company with additional business partners. IQT also uses request for proposal. Essentially, IQT is empowered to use whatever model meets its objective. </font></span></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom:0cm"><span style="line-height:120%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In the area of R&amp;D, the CIA’s agreement with IQT allows it and/or its partners to retain title to the innovations created, and to freely negotiate the allocation of Intellectual Property (IP) derived revenues. The only major stipulation is that the CIA retain traditional "government purpose rights" to the innovations. This agreement has allowed IQT to amass considerable financial resources secretly over the last nineteen years since its inception. Also, this agreement has permitted collaborating and beholden individuals to become extremely wealthy and powerful.</font></span></p>

If he didn’t exist, he would need to be invented by Facebook’s marketing department. Primarily, the legend and image of a fresh faced Zuckerberg provides a palatable context that entices young people to voluntarily part with their constitutional right to privacy for social acceptance.

Bannon is widely considered a racist, anti-Semite and white nationalist. The supper PAC also donated funds to rightwing Senator Ted Cruz.

They were both on the payroll of the National Science Foundation (NSF) while working on its Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP).

The MDDS program sought to identify the digital fingerprints of users inside the World Wide Web so information requests could be tracked, sorted and aggregated to reveal individual proclivities and that of like-minded others with the intention of assembling target groups for easy surveillance so as to predict and counter their plans. The MDDS project was named Birds of a Feather with the thinking that like-minded individuals will engage in coordinated action together, just as birds fly in predictable V-formations. Predictability is key to the CIA in its efforts to weaponize social unrest. MDDS is considered to have helped create the design breakthrough that <a href="https://qz.com/1145669/googles-true-origin-partly-lies-in-cia-and-nsa-research-grants-for-mass-surveillance/">Google was built upon</a></font></span></p>

According to the authors, </font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">search and autocomplete algorithms prioritize sites with rightwing bias, and far-right groups trick it to boost propaganda and misinformation in search rankings.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> As described below, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/16/google-autocomplete-rightwing-bias-algorithm-political-propaganda">the authors uncovered this bias</a> in environmental as well as social and political examples: </font></font></span></span></span></p>

Google’s search algorithm and its autocomplete function prioritize websites that, for example, declare that climate change is a hoax, being gay is a sin, and the Sandy Hook mass shooting never happened.”</font></font></span></span></span></p>

On the t-shirt is a drawing of Che Guevara, a limp wrist, and text. Upon review, I found that an extreme rightwing group is marketing this t-shirt. The word “figs” in the text is written with a missing “I” that is replaced with the drawing of a fig hanging from a tree branch. Because of drawing of a limp wrist, this text can be interpreted by the reader to mean that socialism is for “fags.” In the US, the word “fag” is a derogatory name for homosexuals, and a limp wrist is a derogatory symbol. This supports the Guardian’s observation of Google’s bias against homosexuals as well its bias against socialists. Additionally, the fig fruit represents the name of the village in Bolivia where Che Guevara was captured and murdered. Thus, the fig represents a death threat against socialists. Hopefully, a socialist cyber activist can remove this blight against a beloved revolutionary hero.</font></font></span></span></span></p>
