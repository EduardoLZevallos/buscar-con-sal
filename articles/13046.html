<h3><strong><em><span style="font-size:medium">“That’s unbelievable,” my father-in-law wrote me from Ireland after watching me give a statistic-heavy <a href="https://youtu.be/FD_GnB3AAxU" target="_blank">webinar</a> on the advances for the poor in Nicaragua since 2007.</span> <span style="font-size:medium">“I know, right?” I replied.</span></em></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><em><span style="font-size:medium">“No, I mean it’s actually unbelievable,” he wrote back. “For cynical and tired privileged people like ourselves, our faith in humanity has been undermined and we’ve lost all hope of goodness. The story of a government really looking after ordinary people is too good to be true.”</span></em></strong></h3>

<h3><em>I understand what he means. If I hadn’t been living in Nicaragua for the last 20 years and hadn’t seen with my own eyes the changes since the Sandinista government came back in to power with a pro poor strategy 14 years ago, I know that I, too, would dismiss the statistics as nothing but propaganda. But I have seen these changes, so how can I reach those who are too cynical to believe in a government working for the good of its people?</em> <em>My father-in-law has been to our home in a rural village just outside Managua many times over the past 20 years, but it’s been awhile since he visited. His favorite pastime in Nicaragua has been sitting on our porch, chatting with our neighbors and taking part in village life. Perhaps if he understood how the statistics translate into real changes for these villagers he cares for, then he might allow himself to believe that it’s not just propaganda. So here is a letter to him:</em></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:medium"><b><i><u>Potable Water:</u></i></b> <b><i>Today, access to potable water in Nicaragua has risen from 65% of urban homes in 2007 to 92%. Access to water in rural areas has risen from 28% to 55% and 3,127 community water committees have been established.</i></b></span></p>

<p>Do you remember the afternoon you spent walking down to the village well with our neighbor Oscar, waiting in line with all the village boys to fill three barrels of water for our household, then riding on the ox cart back up the hill? It was a unique thrill for you, but it was an ordinary afternoon for Oscar. At that time, our whole village rationed water for washing, bathing and drinking. Our neighbors only had chickens and a few cows because they had to carry all the water for livestock. No one had much of a garden, it was too expensive – we and our neighbors often paid $55 per month for water and hauling it from the well.</p>

<p>Now, a new well provides water for two villages – 575 households – and we have clean drinking water coming out of the tap in our homes. The water project is administered by a community water and sanitation committee which has installed meters and collects monthly charges – usually less than $10. Our neighbors have more cows, pigs, and most grow seasonal kitchen gardens – getting starts and seeds for free from a government program – in addition to their fields of beans, corn and rice. The boys of the village – the ones who used to spend all afternoon down at the well – can now do their homework instead…much to their chagrin!</p>

<p><span style="font-size:medium"><b><i><u>Electrical Coverage: </u></i></b><b><i>Electrical coverage has gone from 54% to 99%. In 2007, Nicaragua’s electricity was sourced at only 26% renewable. Today with huge investment in wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, and hydroelectric, more than 80% of Nicaragua’s electricity is produced using renewable resources. Since 2007, 38 million barrels of oil have been saved, thanks to this switch.</i></b></span></p>

<p>Do you remember when you first came to visit us and you tried to show us a video, but every time the refrigerator motor kicked in, the computer turned off? Like all our neighbors, we were bringing our electricity from the well, and even though we had purchased proper wire, at a distance of 900 meters, the electricity wasn’t stable. You probably remember visiting Mario’s house, which was barely lit by one bulb at night by electricity conducted through pieced-together barbed wire.</p>

<p>Well, now every house in the village is connected to the grid. Each family pays their monthly electric bill, although those with low consumption – 80% of the population – receive a subsidy to cover 45% of their bill. Now Mario doesn’t just have one light bulb, he and his wife Sara have one of the largest shops in the village, with two refrigerators for selling perishable food and drink.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="tab-stops:.25in 1.5in"><span style="font-size:medium"><b><i><u>Education</u></i></b><b><i>: In 2003, the average Nicaraguan had 3½ years of schooling and o</i></b><b><i>nly 30% of those starting 1st grade were expected to finish 6th grade. </i></b><b><i>Today, youth with no schooling at all has dropped from 24% to 4%. Rates for passing primary and secondary grades have increased from 79% to 91% and remarkably, the percentage of the population with a university degree has risen from 9% to 19%.</i></b></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="tab-stops:.25in 1.5in">Do you remember when our daughters started preschool at the village primary school when they were two and three? Remember how their teacher earned less than $20 per month? Remember how they started the food program, and all the children would line up with their bowls and spoons to be served beans and rice at recess? Remember when our younger daughter started first grade and you were so shocked to see a 13 year old in her class who had never learned to read and write?</span></span></p>

<p>Do you remember Armando and Junior who used to come up and juggle on our porch? When their older cousins finished sixth grade, there wasn’t a secondary school in the village so students had to travel out to the highway. It wasn’t far, but families couldn’t afford the transport costs, and so many kids never even made it to 7<sup>th</sup> grade. Well, by the time Armando and Junior finished sixth grade, the government had started a program using rural primary schools for secondary classes on Saturdays. Kids from surrounding villages now come to our school here for secondary classes every Saturday. Armando was able to help his grandpa with their cattle during the week, and Junior got a job in Managua, and on Saturdays they attended school. Both Armando and Junior graduated last year. They didn’t go on to university, but they are both now studying at a technical school – culinary arts and hotel management. Their classmates are in auto mechanics courses, veterinary school and studying at the university, all for free. Our village now has agronomists, doctors, nurses, accountants, pharmacists, and engineers.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0in"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="tab-stops:.25in 1.5in"><span style="font-size:medium"><b><i><u>Health Care</u></i></b><b><i>: Since 2007 there are 212% more maternal wait homes and 88% fewer home births, maternal mortality rates lowered by 70% and infant mortality rates lowered by 61%. </i></b><b><i>T<span style="background:white"><span style="color:black"><span style="letter-spacing:0.1pt">here has been a 46% reduction chronic malnutrition children under 5 and a 66% reduction chronic malnutrition in children 6 to 12 years old.</span></span></span></i></b></span><b><i> </i></b></span></span></p>

<p>Remember when our girls were born at home? We were lucky enough to pay a doctor to be there with us. Many of our neighbors had given birth at home too – with no doctor. I remember talking with a co-worker who told me how she birthed all but one of her thirteen kids at home by herself! When I was pregnant with Orla, our neighbor Nelson stopped me on my way to work and asked, “Are you in a hurry?” It turned out his wife was in labor and needed a ride to the hospital, I was worried because she was silent during the 30 minute trip – she gave birth just 10 minutes after I dropped them off! Now, our pregnant neighbors don’t have to worry about traveling in labor, they can go in to the maternal wait home for the last two weeks of their pregnancies where they are monitored by doctors. Their moms or sisters can be with them during labor, and they give can give birth closer to home.  </p>

<p>Do you remember on your first trip to Nicaragua 20 years ago when we drove into the barrio of Nueva Vida and you remarked at how cute the blond kids were with their fat bellies and I had to tell you that straw-like hair and potbellies are symptoms of severe malnutrition? You were heartbroken. Thanks to increased medical care – more medical professionals, hospitals, health centers, mobile clinics – and the school lunch program, it’s rare to see kids with visible malnutrition anymore.</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Infrastructure</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: Nicaragua now boasts the best roads in the region. Since 2007 the country has doubled the mileage of paved roads, paving new nearly 2,000 KM, repairing another 2,000 KM, building 120 km new bridges and drainage systems.</span></i></b></p>

<p>Do you remember when we first moved to the village and you would call us on your land line once a month and we always had a new story about getting stuck in the mud and pulling the truck out with three teams of oxen, or the road washing away and having to walk in and out, or the tires going flat constantly from debris carried into the road? How long has it been since we had a new story like that for you?</p>

<p>Even following two Category 4 hurricanes in two weeks last year, the roads were fixed in a matter of days. Now we have bridges over every arroyo between our house and town, many of the roads are paved, and the dirt roads are maintained regularly. Even when it’s raining hard, we can get to work and home again safely, our neighbors get their crops to town, and the buses and motorcycle taxis run their full routes year round.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:medium"><b><i><u>Agriculture:</u></i></b> </span><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">Since 2007, $548 million has been given in credits to small farmers, attending around 25,700 farmers per year. Since 2007, nearly 318,000 members have been inducted into 5,900 new cooperatives. Nicaragua now produces 90% of its own food.</span></i></b></p>

<p>Do you remember our neighbor Wilmer who used to wave to you as he’d drive his horse cart loaded with tree trunks? He was feeding his family then by chopping down trees and selling them for firewood. Well, I recently saw Wilmer at the mayor’s office. Like us, he was picking up a donation of hardwood seedlings from the Forestry Institute. He’s not only reforesting his own land, but he’s also learned aquaculture and has a fish tank for tilapia, and he takes a load of organic vegetables to market once a week. He and some other neighbors helped us to get black sesame seeds for a test plot. The farmer co-op we work with has 220 acres of organic sesame planted in the village this year, and now another 15 acres of black sesame. For the third year in a row, they’ll give seasonal work to 80 of our neighbors – mostly women – during the harvest.</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Creative Economy</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: Since 2007, 23,345 micro and small businesses have been formalized, meaning those workers are now in the social security system. 3.5 million women have taken free courses, internships, workshops, and seminars to strengthen work skills. The government has sponsored 32,552 fairs and built 144 municipal markets. 3.5 million women have taken free courses, internships, workshops, and seminars to strengthen work skills. 800,000 women have received loans at 5% annual interest; an average of $18 million dollars is loaned per year.</span></i></b></p>

<p>Do you remember Paula? When you last saw her she was a single mom working cleaning and cooking to support her son. Paula now works an office job and runs two small businesses on the side. Both businesses are legally registered, and her two employees are registered with social security, receiving benefits and paying toward their retirement pensions. Together with a dozen other women, Paula just finished a free two month-long course on design and product development and is exhibiting her products at fairs. Her employees attend regular free seminars on customer service, leadership, and hygiene.</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Gender Equality</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: Since 2006, overall gender equality Nicaragua has gone from 62 out of 153 countries to number five worldwide. Nicaragua is number one in the world for women’s health and survival, for women’s educational attainment and for women cabinet ministers. </span></i></b></p>

<p>One of the things that have always impressed you about Nicaragua is its people. In particular, Nicaraguan women come across even to foreigners like you as strong, independent, and uncompromising. After hearing the tales of our village, and knowing Nicaraguans as you do, it should not surprise you that Nicaragua is one of the most gender equal countries in the world, and that in the past 14 years, it has closed the gender gap by 80%. Nicaraguan women like the ones you know from our village finally have the legal framework and opportunities to guarantee them the equality they have always insisted on.</p>

<p>So, after this, are you still feeling cynical? I know it’s hard to believe that any country has so intentionally and diligently worked to improve the lot of ordinary people, but I want you to know that we are witnesses to the exception to the rule that is Nicaragua. </p>

 <b>Nicaragua es la Excepción: Carta a un Cínico</b>

<p> </p>

<p><i>[Ingles Arriba]</i><span style="font-size:medium"> "Eso es increíble," me escribió mi suegro desde Irlanda después de ver un seminario web donde yo di muchas estadísticas sobre los avances para los pobres en Nicaragua desde 2007.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:medium">“¿Verdad que sí?” Respondí.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:medium">“No, quiero decir que es realmente increíble,” respondió. “Para los privilegiados cínicos y cansados ​​como nosotros, nuestra fe en la humanidad se ha visto socavada y hemos perdido toda esperanza de bondad. Un cuento de un gobierno que realmente se ocupa de la gente común es demasiado bueno para ser verdad. "</span></p>

<p>Entiendo lo que quiere decir. Si no hubiera estado viviendo en Nicaragua durante los últimos 20 años y no hubiera visto con mis propios ojos los cambios desde que el gobierno sandinista regresó al poder con una estrategia a favor de los pobres hace 14 años, sé que yo también, descartaría las estadísticas como nada más que propaganda.</p>

<p>Pero he visto estos cambios, entonces, ¿cómo puedo hacer entender a aquellos que son demasiado cínicos para creer en un gobierno que trabaja por el bien de su gente?</p>

<p>Mi suegro ha estado en nuestra casa en una comarca rural en las afueras de Managua muchas veces durante los últimos 20 años, pero no ha regresado desde hace varios años. Su pasatiempo favorito en Nicaragua ha sido sentarse en nuestro porche, platicar con nuestros vecinos y participar en la vida del pueblo. Quizás si entendiera cómo las estadísticas se traducen en cambios reales para esta gente que le importa, entonces podría permitirse creer que no se trata solo de propaganda. Así que a continuación le mando una carta a él:</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Agua potable</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: Hoy en día, el acceso al agua potable en Nicaragua ha aumentado del 65% de los hogares urbanos en 2007 al 92%. El acceso al agua en las zonas rurales ha aumentado del 28% al 55% y se han establecido 3.127 Comités de Agua Potable y Saneamiento (CAPS).</span></i></b></p>

<p>¿Recuerda la tarde que pasó caminando hasta el pozo del pueblo con nuestro vecino Oscar, esperando en la fila con todos los muchachos del pueblo para llenar tres barriles de agua para nuestra casa y luego montando en la carreta de bueyes de regreso? Fue una emoción única para ti, pero fue una tarde cualquiera para Oscar. En ese momento, toda nuestra comarca racionaba el agua para lavarse, bañarse y beber. Nuestros vecinos solo tenían gallinas y algunas vacas porque tenían que acarrear el agua para las bestias. Nadie tenía huerto, era demasiado caro; nosotros y nuestros vecinos solíamos pagar hasta $55 dólares al mes por el agua y el transporte del agua.</p>

<p>Ahora, un nuevo pozo proporciona agua a dos comarcas, 575 hogares, y tenemos agua potable que sale del grifo de nuestras casas. El proyecto de agua es administrado por un comité de agua potable y saneamiento de la comunidad, y el comité ha instalado medidores y cobra mensualmente para pagar los gastos de suministrar el agua, generalmente menos de $10. Nuestros vecinos pueden tener más vacas, cerdos y la mayoría cultivan huertos obteniendo semillas y plantas gratis de un programa del gobierno para complementar sus siembros de frijoles, maíz y arroz. Los chavalos del pueblo, los que solían pasar toda la tarde en el pozo acarreando agua para sus familias, ahora tienen tiempo para hacer su tarea... ¡aunque no estoy segura que les guste este cambio!</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Cobertura eléctrica</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: La cobertura eléctrica ha pasado del 54% al 99%. En 2007, la electricidad de Nicaragua se obtuvo con solo un 26% de energía renovable. Hoy, con una enorme inversión en energía eólica, biomasa, geotermia, solar e hidroeléctrica, más del 80% de la electricidad de Nicaragua se produce utilizando recursos renovables. Desde 2007 se han ahorrado 38 millones de barriles de petróleo gracias a este cambio.</span></i></b></p>

<p>¿Recuerdas la primera vez que viniste a visitarnos y intentaste mostrarnos un video, pero cada vez que se encendía el motor del refrigerador, la computadora se apagaba? Como todos nuestros vecinos, traíamos la electricidad del pozo y, aunque habíamos comprado el cable adecuado, a una distancia de 900 metros, la electricidad no era estable. Probablemente recuerde haber visitado la casa de Mario, que apenas estaba iluminada por una bombilla por la noche por la electricidad conducida a través de tucos de alambres de púas.</p>

<p>Bueno, ahora todas las casas del pueblo están conectadas a la red. Cada familia paga su factura de luz mensual, aunque las de bajo consumo, el 80% de la población, reciben un subsidio para cubrir el 45% de su factura. Ahora Mario no solo tiene una bombilla, él y su esposa Sara tienen una de las ventas más grandes del vecindario, con dos refrigeradores para vender alimentos y bebidas perecederos.</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Educación</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: En 2003, promedio, los nicaragüenses contaban con 3 ½ años de escolaridad y se esperaba que sólo el 30% de los que comenzaban el primer grado terminaran el sexto grado. Hoy en día, la juventud sin escolaridad ha bajado del 24% al 4%. Las tasas de aprobación de los grados de primaria y secundaria han aumentado del 79% al 91% y, más impresionante todavía, el porcentaje de la población con un título universitario ha aumentado del 9% al 19%.</span></i></b></p>

<p>¿Te acordás cuando nuestras hijas empezaron el preescolar en la escuela primaria del pueblo cuando tenían tres años? ¿Te acordás que la profesora ganaba menos de $20 al mes? ¿Te acordás cuando comenzaron el programa de alimentación y todos los niños hacían fila con sus platos y cucharas para que les sirvieran frijoles y arroz en el recreo? ¿Te acordás cuando la chiquita comenzó el primer grado y te sorprendiste tanto ver a un estudiante de 13 años en su clase que nunca había aprendido a leer y escribir?</p>

<p>¿Te acuerdas de Armando y Junior que llegaban a practicar malabares en nuestro porche? Cuando sus primos mayores terminaron sexto grado, no había una escuela secundaria en el pueblo, por lo que los estudiantes tuvieron que viajar hasta la carretera. No estaba lejos, pero las familias no podían pagar los costos de transporte y muchos niños ni siquiera llegaron a séptimo grado. Pero cuando Armando y Junior terminaron sexto grado, el gobierno había iniciado un programa que utilizaba escuelas primarias rurales para las clases secundarias los sábados. Los niños de las comarcas cercanas ahora vienen a nuestro colegio para clases de secundaria todos los sábados. Armando pudo ayudar a su abuelo con el ganado durante la semana, y Junior consiguió un trabajo en Managua y los sábados iban a la escuela. Tanto Armando como Junior se graduaron el año pasado. No fueron a la universidad, pero ahora ambos están estudiando en una escuela técnica: artes culinarias y administración hotelera. Sus compañeros están en cursos de mecánica automotriz, programas de veterinaria y estudian carreras en la universidad, todo gratis. Nuestro pueblo ahora tiene agrónomos, médicos, enfermeras, contadores, farmacéuticos e ingenieros.</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Infraestructura</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: Nicaragua ahora cuenta con las mejores carreteras de la región. Desde 2007 el país ha duplicado el kilometraje de carreteras pavimentadas, pavimentando casi 2.000 KM nuevos, reparando otros 2.000 KM, construyendo 120 km de nuevos puentes y sistemas de drenaje.</span></i></b></p>

<p>¿Te acordás cuando nos mudamos al pueblo por primera vez y nos llamabas desde tu línea fija una vez al mes y siempre te teníamos un nuevo cuento sobre quedarnos pegados en el lodo y tener que sacar el camión con tres yuntas de bueyes, o que los caminos se quedaban incomunicados y tuvimos que entrar y salir a pie, o de llantas ponchadas constantemente debido a la basura llevado al camino por los corrientes? ¿Cuánto tiempo ha pasado desde que te tenemos un nuevo cuento como esos?</p>

<p>Incluso después de dos huracanes de categoría 4 en dos semanas el año pasado, las carreteras se arreglaron en cuestión de días. Ahora tenemos puentes sobre cada arroyo entre nuestra casa y la ciudad, muchos de los caminos están pavimentados y los caminos de tierra se mantienen regularmente. Incluso cuando llueve mucho, podemos llegar al trabajo y volver a casa de manera segura, nuestros vecinos llevan sus cosechas a la ciudad y los autobuses y mototaxis recorren sus rutas completas durante todo el año.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:medium"><b><i><u>Agricultura</u></i></b><b><i>: Desde 2007, se han otorgado $ 548 millones en créditos a pequeños agricultores, atendiendo a unos 25.700 agricultores por año y 318.000 miembros se han incorporado a 5.900 nuevas cooperativas. Nicaragua ahora produce el 90% de la comida que consume</i></b></span><span style="font-size:medium">.</span></p>

<p>¿Te acordás de nuestro vecino Wilmer, que te saludaba mientras pasaba en un carretón de caballo cargado de troncos de árboles? Entonces ganaba la vida talando árboles y vendiéndolos para leña. Hace poco le miré a Wilmer en la Alcaldía. Igual que nosotros, estaba recogiendo una donación de árboles de madera preciosa de INAFOR. No solo está reforestando su finca, sino que también ha aprendido de acuicultura y tiene una pecera para tilapia, y cada semana lleva sus verduras orgánicas al mercado. Él y algunos otros vecinos nos ayudaron a conseguir semillas de ajonjolí negro para una parcela de prueba. La cooperativa de agricultores con la que trabajamos tiene 150 manzanas de ajonjolí orgánico sembradas en la co marca actualmente, y ahora otros 10 manzanas de ajonjolí negro. Por tercer año consecutivo, darán trabajo por temporada a 80 de nuestros vecinos, en su mayoría mujeres, durante la cosecha.</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Economía Creativa</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: Desde 2007, se han formalizado 23,345 micro y pequeñas empresas, lo que significa que esos trabajadores están ahora en el sistema de seguridad social. 3,5 millones de mujeres han realizado cursos, pasantías, talleres y seminarios gratuitos para fortalecer sus competencias laborales. El gobierno ha patrocinado 32,552 ferias y construido 144 mercados municipales. 800.000 mujeres han recibido préstamos al 5% de interés anual; se les presta un promedio de $ 18 millones de dólares por año.</span></i></b></p>

<p>¿Te acordás de Paula? La última vez que la viste era una madre soltera que trabajaba limpiando y cocinando para mantener a su hijo. Paula ahora trabaja en una oficina y además tiene dos pequeñas empresas propias. Ambas empresas están inscritas y sus dos empleados están inscritos en el INSS, reciben prestaciones sociales y están acumulando semanas para poder jubilarse con una pensión. Junta con otras mujeres, Paula acaba de terminar un curso gratuito sobre diseño y desarrollo de productos y exhibe sus productos en ferias. Sus empleados asisten regularmente a seminarios gratuitos sobre servicio al cliente, liderazgo e higiene.</p>

<p><b><i><u><span style="font-size:medium">Igualdad de género</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style="font-size:medium">: Desde 2006, la igualdad de género en Nicaragua ha pasado del 62 de 153 países al número cinco en todo el mundo. Nicaragua es el número uno en el mundo en salud y supervivencia de la mujer, en acceso y logros educativos de la mujer y en mujeres ministras.</span></i></b></p>

<p>Una de las cosas que siempre te ha impresionado de Nicaragua es su gente. En particular, se nota que las mujeres nicaragüenses son fuertes, independientes e intransigentes. Después de escuchar las historias de nuestro pueblo y conocer a los nicaragüenses, no debería sorprenderte saber que Nicaragua es uno de los países con mayor igualdad de género en el mundo, y que en los últimos 14 años se ha cerrado la brecha de género en el 80 %. Las mujeres nicaragüenses como las que conoces en nuestra comarca por fin tienen el marco legal y las oportunidades para garantizarles la igualdad por la cual siempre han luchado.</p>

<p>Entonces, después de esto, ¿todavía te sientes cínico? Sé que es difícil de creer que un país haya trabajado de manera tan intencionada y diligente para mejorar la situación de su gente, pero quiero que sepas que nosotros somos testigos la excepción que es Nicaragua.</p>
