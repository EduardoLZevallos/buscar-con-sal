Paradise Lost, Book One<br>
      <br>
Any Hollywood film director casting for Lucifer and his fallen host for
a film of Milton's "Paradise Lost" need look no further than the
generation of US diplomats contemporary with John Dmitri Negroponte.
Negroponte was the suave, cynical, death squad manager supreme of the
United States Foreign Service. He cut his teeth with Henry Kissinger
and George Herbert Bush in the era of the murderous Phoenix Program in
Vietnam and the bloody, treacherous coup against Salvador Allende in
Chile.<br>
      <br>
He later graduated to run Ronald Reagan and Jean
Kirkpatrick's dirty war in Honduras and, behind the backs of the US
people, their narcotics-linked terror war against Nicaragua throughout
the 1980s. From there he went on to supervise similar operations to
help complete the Bush Jr. regime's destruction of Iraq. It is
impossible to exaggerate the sadistic cruelty and sleek hypocrisy of
Negroponte and his colleagues. Among these, Robert J. Callahan might be
termed the long distance running delivery-boy of the Negroponte
generation. He worked with Negroponte in Honduras and in Iraq. Now he
is back in Central America rolling back democracy and prosperity for
the impoverished majority as hard as he can.<br>
      <br>
Ambassador
Callahan seldom allows his smug death's head smirk to slip. But he did
so recently in Managua, when challenged about US claims to moral
authority in the matter of democratic elections. A pro-Sandinista
reporter asked Callahan how he justified his constant disparaging
remarks about Nicaragua's electoral process in the light of the blatant
fraud perpetrated in Florida during the 2000 presidential elections in
the United States. Callahan replied by blurting out a series of
blunders, alleging that the Florida election only suffered "mechanical"
problems and that "it was the most observed election in history".<br>
      <br>
The literature documenting the electoral fraud in that Florida election
is so extensive that only someone of Callahan's obdurate prideful
deceit and steadfast hate of democracy could try and bluster it out of
existence. The Florida Republicans' manipulation of electoral
databases, the deliberate allocation of sub-standard voting machines to
areas likely to vote democrat, the relentless efforts to harrass voters
likely to vote democrat - all of that is incontrovertible. All those
entrenched anomalies were compounded by the blatant politicization of
key decisions in relation to electoral procedure right up to the US
Supreme Court judgment which split the Supreme Court justices straight
down party political lines.<br>
      <br>
Callahan's ridiculous comment that
the 2000 US presidential election in Florida was "the most observed
election in history" is especially gross given his insistence on the
issue of foreign electoral observers for Nicaragua's forthcoming
presidential elections in November 2011. No foreign electoral observers
monitored that Florida election. Neither the Organization of American
States, the United Nations nor the European Union sent observers to
watch the pathetic farce in Florida unfold. Rightly so, the United
States people reckon they are entitled to monitor their own elections
without foreign interference.<br>
      <br>
But US government diplomats like
Callahan apply a double standard by insisting on foreign election
observers for countries like Nicaragua. Anyone familiar with US history
is well aware that in the modern era electoral fraud has been a
controversial fact of life in US politics from Cook County in Illinois
to Jim Wells County in South Texas. That fact is perhaps best captured
in what may be an apocryphal story of how John F. Kennedy's father Joe
allegedly complained to his President son how expensive it had been to
buy him that presidential election of 1960. Ambassador Callahan's
absurd posturing in defence of the US electoral system's highly
questionable integrity confirms his dishonesty and contempt for the
facts.<br>
      <br>
Shortly after that revealing outburst to local
journalists in Managua the other day, Callahan gave a rambling,
confused speech to the local American Chamber of Commerce in Managua
attempting to whitewash the record of the US government in Nicaragua.
Among the usual balderdash about promoting democracy and prosperity,
Callahan alleged that the US government has invested US$2bn in
Nicaragua since 1990 and that he and his US government colleagues do
not intervene in Nicaragua's internal politics. These deceitful,
laughable claims are often repeated but fail to bear even the slightest
examination.<br>
      <br>
Anyone with experience of the way the aid and
development industry works knows that waste, greed and inefficiency
tend to operate at every level. Despite the best efforts of honest aid
workers and bureaucrats, development programmes delivered within the
context of corporate capitalist economic models do not generally
deliver efficient, appropriate, cost-effective, sustainable benefits
for the impoverished majority. Rather, bilking taxpayers in the donor
country concerned, such programmes reward the managers and officials
delivering them and consolidate local managerial classes in the image
of the rich-country aid and development managerial classes. A look at
what that means in practical terms may be helpful.<br>
      <br>
Take a
modest two year US$2m program to deliver technical services to small
farmers. That program will be contracted out by USAID to a large US
corporate contractor in the development business. In-country, the
office running that programme will have a senior manager, a couple of
junior managers, three or four accounts personnel. The salary and
benefits packages over two years for those 6 or 7 individuals will add
up to around US$500,000. Operating costs for that office&nbsp; plus the
purchase of two or three US-made SUVs, their fuel and maintenance, will
easily add up to another US$200,000 over two years.<br>
      <br>
So what's
left to farm out to local NGOs is about US$1.3m over two years. Say
that sum is spread out between 8 local organizations. Each one of those
organizations will have it's own managerial and office staff as well as
it's own transport and office costs that on average would most likely
chew up US$40,000 a year each, totalling around US$640,000 over the two
years. So then what's left of that US$2m that sounds so impressive to
spend "in the field" to benefit impoverished Nicaraguan farmers is
about US$660,000. That's around 30% of the original US$2m and pans out
at about US$330,000 per year<br>
      <br>
One can argue the details, but
the extrapolation is entirely reasonable. Of the US$2bn trumpeted by
shameless faker Robert J. Callahan only around 30% is likely to have
benefited ordinary people in Nicaragua. The great bulk of all that
bloated rhetorical US$2bn will disappear into the pockets and bank
accounts of US corporate and government managers, their local cronies
and proxies on inflated per diems like auditors and consultants of one
kind or another.<br>
      <br>
So what one is actually looking at in real
terms, on a charitable view, is about US$660m that may have&nbsp;
benefited
ordinary people in Nicaragua over 20 years, about US$33m a year. That
is the nitty gritty of US development aid to Nicaragua. It explains
why, despite the huge nominal sum of US aid, Nicaragua from 1990 to
2007 relentlessly failed to make progress in areas of fundamental
importance like education, agricultural production, health care, energy
supply or road communications.<br>
      <br>
Only since the Sandinista
government led by President Daniel Ortega took office in January 2007
has Nicaragua made real progress on basic problems in those areas. It
has done so dramatically, thanks to its membership of the ALBA
solidarity-based trade and development bloc led by Venezuela and Cuba.
Since 2007 ALBA has made available directly to local Nicaraguan
organizations well over US$400m a year. Nicaragua's electricity
generating capacity, road communications and port infrasructure,
literacy levels, access to health care have all dramatically improved
in just four years.<br>
      <br>
Robert J. Callahan witnesses that reality
with Miltonic affliction and dismay. Despite his false claim to the
contrary he and his US government colleagues do intervene relentlessly
in Nicaragua's internal politics. The days may be gone when his
predecessor Olivar Garza went out publicly on the campaign trail with
then presidential candidate Enrique Bola&ntilde;os. But Garza's
successors,
Barbara Moore and, later,&nbsp; Paul Trivelli, openly attacked the
leadership of Nicaragua's two biggest political parties, the FSLN led
by Daniel Ortega and the PLC led by Arnoldo Aleman. Ambassador Callahan
behaves in a way entirely consistent with his diplomatic forebears in
Nicaragua, brazenly declaring support for reactionary, sinister
anti-Sandinista political figures like Estel&iacute;'s bishop Abelardo
Matta.<br>
      <br>
US aid in Nicaragua has almost exclusively funded and promoted
organizations openly opposed to the FSLN coalition government under the
banner "democracy promotion". The US government has shaken down United
States taxpayers so as to fund numerous NGOs and anti-democratic
personalities falsely claiming to represent a majority in Nicaragua.
Many of these are supporters of the tiny Sandinista Renovation Movement
which regularly wins around 1% support in national opinion polls. The
US government pseudo-development payroll in Nicaragua supports
pro-abortion women's activists, blatantly sectarian anti-Sandinista
"election observers" and disingenuous sectarian journalists among a
host of others.<br>
      <br>
Ambassador Callahan is scheduled to leave
Nicaragua around June or July. All the signs are that he will miss
witnessing a decisive win for the FSLN led by Daniel Ortega in this
year's presidential elections. Recently, with much irony, President
Daniel Ortega publicly offered to help Robert Callahan get Nicaraguan
citizenship so as to run openly as an opposition candidate in future
Nicaraguan elections. Ortega's point seems to be twofold.<br>
      <br>
Firstly, he wants to highlight Ambassador Callahan's anomalous
activities as a diplomat promoting Nicaragua's opposition political
parties in this election year. Secondly, he seems to be pointing out to
the US government and its European allies that their blatant routine
intervention in Nicaragua's internal affairs will not prevent the
electoral outcome most Nicaraguans likely to vote seem clearly to want
at the moment. That outcome will probably be a decisive victory for the
FSLN both in the presidential election and in the legislative elections.<br>
      <br>
Such a result may well mean Sandinista control of Nicaragua's National
Assembly for the first time since 1989. Most likely, it is that
prospect that has caused Ambassador Callahan to lose his cool over the
last few days. The thought of lost happiness and lasting pain resulting
from a Sandinista win really does torment him. Kept on in Managua by
the Obama administration to arrange for a Sandinista electoral defeat,
it looks as though Ambassador Callahan's career will end in the "huge
affliction and dismay" facing Milton's Lucifer - the role model for
Callahan and Negroponte's generation of US diplomats.</td>
