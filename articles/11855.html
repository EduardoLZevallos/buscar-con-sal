<a href="https://www.revistadefrente.cl/no-es-persecucion-politica-es-defensa-de-la-soberania-patria-y-de-la-paz-margine-gutierrez/">https://www.revistadefrente.cl/no-es-persecucion-politica-es-defensa-de…</a></em></p>

<h3><img alt="" height="220" src="https://www.revistadefrente.cl/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AP_18182023085605-1-1877x852-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="420" /><em><strong>People are mistaken who think the legal action that the State is taking against well known imperialist agents in Nicaragua have to do with this year's elections, seeking to remove from the campaign candidates serving the interests of the United States. Even more  mistaken in the most categorical way are the people spreading the lie that Daniel Ortega fears them and for that reason wants them taken out of the campaign.</strong></em></h3>

<p>Daniel has no need to fear them as opponents in the dispute for power because, in the first place, they are not. None of them have been selected as candidates thus cannot even tell people for which party they might run. They have neither a political  party nor popular support. Meanwhile, Daniel begins his electoral campaign with solid core support of over 38%. No one else in Nicaragua can say the same.</p>

<p>Daniel Ortega is Nicaragua's most recognized politician, the only one who with popular roots because he has always identified with the needs and interests of the impoverished majority, abandoned by successive governments of the conservative oligarchy that sold off their nation. That is why more than 60% of the electorate favor him with their voting intentions.</p>

<p>Daniel Ortega's government has been able to combine public policies prioritizing the creation of opportunities and potential, especially economically, for the country's most vulnerable sectors and those public policies aim to lay the foundations for Nicaragua's sustainable development. The FSLN has a historic program guiding its actions that was worked out collectively in the hardest times of struggle. Nothing is improvised about the FSLN either as a party or in government.</p>

<p>The glass of milk, the school lunch, the home roofing projects, the handing over of thousands of free houses, the seeds and inputs for producers, the free medicines, all go hand in hand with the electrification of the whole country, to the very last corner; with the construction of new roads and bridges, the modernization of our country's ports, the construction of deep water ports; the inauguration of technological training centers; the promotion of projects and processes adding value to our raw materials and many other actions aimed at developing the country's productive forces and creating the material base from which to grow and definitively end poverty.</p>

<p>In Nicaragua now impoverished people no longer experience growing poverty despite broad economic growth inflicted via the speeches of government ministers obeying and implementing IMF prescriptions. Now people all know our country has the highest economic growth in Central America because they see it, feel it and it reaches into their homes.</p>

<p>Daniel Ortega has said clearly that defeating poverty is our greatest challenge and by defeating poverty we will be definitively defeating our people's historical enemies. It is not in the social media networks that Daniel Ortega has his greatest strength but in Nicaragua's people. No other government or political party has done so much for the people in such a short time.</p>

<p>Does the right wing believe, by some chance, that this has no consequences? Of course it does and it is called popular support. The general feeling in Nicaragua is that now there is a government that is concerned and takes effective care of Nicaragua's majority. That is why it is so common to hear that when someone receives a food package, a wheelchair or a decent house; when the medical brigades arrive to deliver care in their home; when they receive seeds and inputs for planting, when they see that they will finally have a health center or a hospital nearby; that their school is no longer falling down and that the new hydraulic concrete road lets them to reach wherever they want in just a few hours, people say "now we have someone concerned about us!..." This is heard every day because in today's Nicaragua all levels of government work for the people every day.</p>

<p>Thus, it is absurd to argue that the State's legal actions in defense of Nicaragua's national sovereignty and peace have their origin in Daniel's fear of the local agents of imperialism. They are not interested in democratizing Nicaragua via free and transparent elections. Their sights are set on destabilizing our country. They have no interest in being candidates, hence they have neither a party or a political project. Instead of promoting opposition unity they have dedicated themselves to impede it because their assigned role is to create the conditions for US intervention in Nicaragua. That is the danger they pose, that through their criminal actions, they may once again plunge Nicaragua into the violence they organized and carried out in 2018 maybe this time ending up in another civil war like the ones they have caused so often in the past.</p>

<p>Daniel Ortega is showing strength. A weak government, one fearful of losing elections, would not be applying the law against servants of a foreign power who have the unconditional support of the United States and the empire's mercenary media satellites. The best proof of this is that the United States has already come to their defense, because of course, they are its employees.</p>

<p>Daniel Ortega is demonstrating that Nicaragua comes first and the highest priority is the country's sovereignty and the peace its people need to make progress. Whereas General Sandino defended Nicaragua by force of arms, now we defend it with the Constitution and the laws, ensuring the rule of law prevails.</p>

<p>Those who are awaiting trial now have committed serious crimes. They are the tools the United States used to organize the violent, failed 2018 attempt at a coup d'état against Nicaragua's legitimately constituted government. They are part of the aggression planned by the United States and have been part of that plan since long before 2018. They are the agents of the United States covert action, receiving very substantial funds to set up front NGOs, buy journalists, create media outlets and support the necessary personnel required to carry out the conspiracy; developing projects to supposedly defend a freedom of expression tailored to their slander and falsehoods. Their role is to lie and confuse, falsifying reality so that the major international  media have the inputs they need to continue discrediting Nicaragua's government and thus justify foreign interference and intervention.</p>

<p>Working hand in hand with the United States, they were the intellectual authors of the catastrophe of 2018, whose dire consequences we are still paying for. They attacked our sustained economic growth. They sabotaged the increasing unity of all Nicaraguans, creating more division in our society. They financed the torture, murder and kidnapping of entire cities and towns and their people for more than three months. They guided the actions of the delinquents they hired to operate the roadblocks, to occupy the universities, to burn down Leon's historic CUUN and the municipal offices in Granada.</p>

<p>They are the intellectual authors of the death of Francisco Pineda who was burned alive. A couple of years ago the material authors who actually committed those crimes were tried. Now it is the turn of the intellectual authors who did what they always do, cast the stone and hide their hand; send out the dupes to stain their hands with blood and put their lives at risk, behind the scenes, they themselves promote their own interests, which will never be those of the impoverished majority.</p>
