What has so far been written about the Wikileaks has tended to fudge
the ideological aspect of the activities of Julian Assange and his
collaborators. Wikileaks is a libertarian project and libertarian
politics are not necessarily progressive. That reality explains
Assange's willingness to associate with Swedish organizations - like
the Pirate Party and the Christian Social Democrats - progressive on
libertarian issues but anti-socialist on others. <br>
      <br>
It also gives useful context to Assange's relationships with the women
accusing him of sex offences, with whom he became involved as a result
of his political public relations work for Wikileaks. One of them is a
Christian Social Democrat activist some of whose articles have appeared
in anti-Cuban government web sites. The Pirate Party, with which
Assange also coordinated his work in Sweden, is a libertarian
organization readily compatible with right wing "free market"
neoliberals. <br>
      <br>
The legal and political entanglements of Wikileaks, Assange's
ideological affinities and personal problems distract far too readily
from the fundamental political reality of the manipulation of the
information released. Defenders of Wikileaks argue, despite Assange's
secretive dealings with major corporate media, that Assange and his
colleagues promote transparency. <br>
      <br>
Freedom of expression has been another slogan brandished by people and
organizations who support Wikileaks. But it is worth asking : freedom
of expression for whom? The main group whose freedom of expression has
been facilitated very effectively by Assange and his colleagues is the
US diplomatic corps.<br>
      <br>
Without Wikileaks, their calumnies and slander would have remained
buried in official secrecy, seeping without attribution into the global
media. Now those slanders are treated as authoritative information and
headline news in mainstream corporate media around the world. Wikileaks
could have coordinated release of the cables with Telesur or
Al-Jazeerah, for example. But Assange and his colleagues chose to cabal
secretively with five mainstream corporate media outlets.<br>
      <br>
Those corporate media outlets regularly dispense NATO propaganda
against targets like Iran, Syria and Hezbollah in the Middle East,
against Russia, China and North Korea, and against the ALBA countries
in Latin America. Now those corporate media are using Wikileaks'
alleged challenge to authority to ram home relentlessly the wholesale
propaganda messages of that self-same, supposedly-challenged authority,
the US government.<br>
      <br>
This is truly a weird version of freedom of expression, effectively
prioritizing cynical apologists for State terror - mass murder,
torture, assassination, destabilization via covert warfare and
psy-warfare - and their corporate media collaborators. Julian Assange
and his colleagues may argue they are promoting transparency by getting
the raw information out there so everyone can make up their own mind.
Such argument is self-evidently disingenuous given the brutal reality
of how global mass media and alternative media work. <br>
      <br>
The case of Nicaragua is a perfect example of how vulnerable to fakery
the whole Wikileaks phenomenon is. To date, the cables released by
Wikileaks on Nicaragua consist of long, hopelessly inaccurate,
slanderous, loony-tunes diatribes by former ambassador Paul Trivelli
and slightly more sophisticated but still thoroughly disingenuous
supercilious codswallop from current ambassador Robert J. Callahan. For
Trivelli and Callahan, Nicaragua's economic, political and social
reality is less important than the propaganda their higher-ups in
Washington want to hear.<br>
      <br>
Trivelli paints a picture of a Nicaragua at the mercy of a corrupt,
incompetent, drugs-trafficking would-be dictator Daniel Ortega.
Callahan, his face hard up against the facts, has had to modify the
portrait to eliminate the drugs-trafficking, and tone down the lies
about corruption and incompetence. But Callahan continues to push the
phoney would-be-dictator angle. <br>
      <br>
News on Nicaragua is mediated via very occasional coverage in the
mainstream corporate media and their alternative counterparts. All
those media have published accounts of events in Nicaragua very similar
to the content of the recently published Wikileaks cables from Trivelli
and Callahan. The similarity stems from the self-evident fact that all
that anti-Nicaraguan government propaganda comes from the
regime-change-hungry Nicaraguan opposition. That is as true of coverage
by, for example, the New York Times as it is of McClatchy News or of
Counterpunch.<br>
      <br>
Hypocrisy on the part of North American libertarian champions of
Wikileaks should come as no surprise. As writers&nbsp; like Heinz
Dieterich
and Pascual Serrano have already pointed out, the leaked cables are a
treasure trove for unscrupulous media similar to the mythical computers
of murdered FARC leader Raul Reyes. In the case of Nicaragua, the
cables reinforce with yet more deceit and distortion material already
published by corporate and alternative media attacking the Sandinista
government led by Daniel Ortega.<br>
      <br>
People familiar with Central America may note that the cables from Hugo
Llorens, the US ambassador to Tegucigalpa, confirm that the coup in
Honduras on June 29th 2009 was in fact a coup d'&eacute;tat. So what?
Deputy
Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela has already publicly stated that
in retrospect the US government accepts the coup was a coup. What's
missing from the leaks is information that the State Department and its
embassy in Tegucigalpa knew of the coup in advance - that really would
be damning news. <br>
      <br>
So far there has been no such truly newsworthy revelation - on Honduras
or anywhere else - in the cables made available by Wikileaks. Before
the cables were released writers like Eva Golinger and others had
already uncovered plenty of circumstantial evidence indicating US
government knowledge of preparations for the coup. The case for
trusting the motives and integrity of Wikileaks would be much stronger
if the cables provided documentary confirmation of that collusion.<br>
      <br>
One comes back constantly to a logical absurdity. We are told that the
very publication of the cables promotes a truer view of world events
and in particular the role of the US government in those events. But we
already know a very great deal&nbsp; about the role of the US
government in
world events. Publication of the source material on which the US
government bases its foreign policy mostly serves merely to reinforce
US government propaganda.<br>
      <br>
Perhaps the fundamental issue at stake in the arguments over the cables
released by Wikileaks is whether the politics of their publication -
who has made them available and how - are likely to promote a more true
and fair media account of world events. Currently, the reverse seems
more likely. In Latin America, the Wikileaks cables will definitely
feed the false propaganda war of the US and its allies against
progressive governments in the region.<br>
