<p><span style="line-height:100%">A very good afternoon, Compañera. Good afternoon, beloved Families of this Nicaragua of Ours, of Dignity, of Utmost Dignity. We come from a History of National Dignity, not a history of dignity as a momentary reaction. But a Story of Dignity, of Behavior, of Knowledge, of Appropriation, of Spirit, of Soul, Dignified, Dignified and still more Dignified.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, precisely, we celebrated ourselves, celebrated the exalted Dignity of this People, our People. The Dignity that our Native Caciques show us, the Indian Archers of Matagalpa; Andrés Castro with his Stone; General José Dolores Estrada. The same Dignity that has defeated the Filibusters of all Times, and expelled them from our Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
Yesterday we celebrated our National Dignity and made it clear, in the words of our General Sandino, “We are heading to the Sun of Freedom”, we live in the Sun of Dignity, and we are a People that Neither Sells Out, Nor Surrenders, Ever!<br />
<br />
With such a history of abuse and outrage by the colonialists and imperialists in our Nicaragua, to the extremes that Dr. Gustavo Porras expounded yesterday, when so many times they tried to create... as they did in fact, but there were those who rebelled and that is the Dignity of this People... To create institutions tailored to their image and likeness so as to dominate us better.<br />
<br />
They occupied us, they desecrated our Sacred Territory, but there were those here who stood fast in opposition and who raised the Flags of National Decorum; those Flags that today fly as National Flags of this Blessed Patriotic Nation, Forever Free.<br />
<br />
Our Dignity stood high, which has nothing to do with a mere reaction of the moment. Rather it is the Spirit, the Nobility, the Character, the Idiosyncrasy, the Identity of the Nicaraguan People, Our People.<br />
<br />
Our Dignity does not depend on any one event or moment, it is not referenced by one single event or amoment. Our Dignity is one of History, Memory, Glory and Permanence, a Dignity that grows even more in the face of any attempt to denigrate or humiliate the People, the History, the Glory of our Nicaragua. Or any attempt to denigrate or humiliate our Dignified Soul, which does come from the Soul, not a mere matter of papers, but very much a matter of the Soul, of Deep Spirituality. It rises up and with the voice of a Giant cries, Onward! Which means we don't allow ourselves be trodden on, offended or humiliated by anyone!<br />
<br />
In these Days of Heroic Celebration of our National Dignity, the gentlemen of UNESCO and the lady there, dared to take on Nicaragua, and I wonder: In 50 years, 30 years, though let's not go even that long, who is going to remember who they are? Who? Ah, but the Historic Memory of Human Dignity does indeed remain engraved, it remains engraved in the Souls of Peoples.<br />
<br />
No one will remember who those unworthy individuals were... Of course, maybe the Institution which, like so many others unfortunately of the United Nations System that was born to defend the world's Peoples, but now, humiliates, denigrates, slanders and falsifies those Peoples' History.<br />
<br />
No one will remember them, but the History and the Glory of the Nicaraguan People and of our Dignity and our Honor, stays engraved in the Memory, precisely, the Truthful Memory of the Peoples' Struggles.<br />
<br />
So, we, acting from our deep sense of National Dignity, feeling and action, have said: Enough! Because one does not play with the Dignity of a People, as one does not play around with Peace, and we said: Enough of this...!, with all the Strength of the Heroism of General Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino, who showed not even the slightest fear in confronting the Empire, the most powerful Army on Earth, with a group of Patriots, as he said, who accompanied him, and now an entire People accompanies him, because it lives that Legacy, that History, that Honor and that Glory.<br />
<br />
No one will remember the proponents of profanity, but the Glory, the Dignity, the Courage, the Sovereignty exercised by our Heroic Nicaraguan People will live forever. We are increasingly proud to be fully consistent with our legacy... Totally consistent!<br />
<br />
Anyone who tries to mess with us should know that this is a People of the utmost, most exalted Dignity, a People of Glorious Identity, a Great People, a People in Arms. And what are our weapons? Dignity, Pride, Honor, Decorum, the demand for Respect for our Sovereignty and Independence.<br />
<br />
So, as we have already told them, we say it again: Don't you dare, don't dare mess with Nicaragua...!<br />
<br />
They Neither Could Prevail, Nor Will They! To the merchants who seek to sell out our Nation... Don't you dare even try!<br />
<br />
Yesterday I saw and heard the words of the Mayor of Jinotega, Compañero Leonidas Centeno, who told the sell outs: You can rest easy, as long as you stay quiet.<br />
<br />
Here the People is vigilant, heroic, brave, noble, and alert, vigilant, especially vigilant because we jealously defend, jealously guard Peace. We know that it is the foundation of our future, and we know how we have defended it at all times.<br />
<br />
The Right to Live in Peace, the Right to Live on our Soil, on our Land, as its Owners, with National Sovereignty. The Right to tell ourselves, with infinite Pride: We are Nicaraguans, we come from a History that is there, to be Taught and to be Practiced as a combative People; we come from and we are that History of a Patriotic Nation and Freedom, of a Dignified Nation, a Sovereign Nation, a Patriotic Nation Always Further On!<br />
<br />
Compañeras and Compañeros, we also want to emphasize that this week celebrate, as we already know, the 80th Anniversary of the Great Victory over Fascism, the plague that wanted to destroy humanity. But there were those who fought, who gave their Lives by the millions, to defend the Human Family, the Human Community; among them 27 million Brother and Sister Citizens of the Soviet Union, who gave a Luminous Example of Light, which may seem repetitive, but it truly is Luminous, of Spiritual Light, of Life and of Truth.<br />
<br />
Today, this week when we are commemorating events of 80 years ago, our Blessed and Forever Free Nicaragua will be represented in the Celebrations, in the Events, in the Parades that are programmed, with a Delegation led by Compañero Laureano; Compañera Arling, Vice President of the National Assembly; Major General Marvin Corrales, Inspector General of the Army; Compañero Daniel Edmundo representing our Sandinista Media... Sandinistas!<br />
<br />
How it hurts them when one says Sandinistas, because they know what that means in terms of solidity, integrity, coherence and courage... Sandinistas! The Sandinista Media of Revolutionary and Evolutionary Communication, that will be represented there in the Media. And too our Ambassador, Compañera Alba Azucena Torres, our Chontaleña Poet. There we are. We'll be there.</span></p>
