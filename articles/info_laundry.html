                revelations of WikiLeaks</span><br>
              <br>
              by Jorge Capel&aacute;n, July 25th 2011</span><br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://wikileaks.org/cablegate.html">The diplomatic
              cables of WikiLeaks</a> are not held in high esteem in
            Nicaragua - and this, not only among the Sandinistas. The
            reason is simple: they present as facts the assertions of
            two former ambassadors, Paul Trivelli y Robert Callahan, who
            have become well known for their blatant stances on the
            country's internal affairs and their vociferously coarse
            tone - a reason why people tend to take their words as
            quaint character traits rather than as sources of classified
            information about US policy towards Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            Both former ambassadors are fanatic right-wingers and
            disciples of the infamous John Dimitri Negroponte. Callahan
            is a member of the hard Republican Right, connoisseur of
            Nicaraguan reality and a former collaborator of the Contras
            during the war carried out by his government against
            Nicaragua in the 1980's. Like Callahan, Trivelli also went
            through the US embassy in Tegucigalpa during that war and
            shares the same narrow world view.<br>
            <br>
            The rhetoric of Callahan's and Trivelli's reports is
            indistinguishable from the deliberate propaganda, often
            violently rude and insulting, used by the main local
            newspapers <a href="http://www.laprensa.com.ni/">La Prensa</a>
            and <a href="http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/">El Nuevo
              Diario</a> - the latter even more so from the moment the
            Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN) began to
            look like&nbsp; the probable winner of the elections of
            November, 2006.<br>
            <br>
            If the unwary researcher visits the <a
              href="http://wlcentral.org/category/countries/nicaragua">Nicaragua


              section</a> of the site <a href="http://wlcentral.org/">WL


              Central</a>, an independent portal that publishes articles
            on the content of WikiLeaks' cables, he or she will discover
            the following "revelations":<br>
            <br>
            - That the social programs of the Sandinista government,
            among them the "Zero Hunger Program" for low income rural
            families and the "Love Program" for street children, "are
            dealt with in the midst of budget deficits" under the
            rationale of "cut the budget and keep it secret".<br>
            <br>
            - That "the leftist party in power Sandinista Front for
            National Liberation (FSLN), whose revolution ousted in 1979
            Anastasio Somoza's dictatorship, promised to establish
            social justice in Nicaragua, but ended up being a corrupt,
            authoritarian movement that supressed the opposition and
            accepted drug trafficking money".<br>
            <br>
            - That "Nicaragua isn't a democracy, since all the State
            powers are controlled by two persons, namely the President,
            Daniel Ortega, and his opponent and former president Arnoldo
            Alem&aacute;n. Neither of them are serving time because
            there is no independent justice in the Central American
            country".<br>
            <br>
            That is exactly what La Prensa and El Nueva Diario repeat
            every day.<br>
            <br>
            A real fact well known to almost everyone in Nicaragua but
            ignored by - especially Western - consumers of WikiLeaks'
            diplomatic cables, is that both newspapers are controlled by
            members of the aristocratic Chamorro family, which exerts
            monopolistic control over the country's media: La Prensa
            (for over 89 years, today run by Jaime Chamorro Cardenal),
            El Nuevo Diario (for over 30 years ago whose current
            director is Francisco Chamorro), as well as the magazines
            Magazine and Confidencial - all of them rabidly
            anti-Sandinista.<br>
            <br>
            The level of dissociation of those outlets from the reality
            of the country is such that, if one day "WikiLeaks" (or any
            of the formats in which it is presented in to the public,
            such as the web site WL Central) produced a cable that
            "proved" the kinship ties of president Daniel Ortega with
            Satan himself, the (mostly Catholic) Nicaraguan public would
            just frown and remark with a sardonic grin : "Just what
            you'd expect from those people at La Prensa and El Nuevo
            Diario!"<br>
            <br>
            There are, broadly speaking, two Nicaraguas: one the
            observer is able to experience by being in the place and
            comparing it with the country's situation, say, five, ten or
            fifteen years beforehand, and a virtual one fed to consumers
            of global media. Regardless of different ideological,
            philosophical and political points of view, the real
            Nicaragua that emerges from direct contact with the country,
            and that direct reality's virtual counterpart, manufactured
            by multinational "news" monopolies, are two parallel and
            radically diverging universes.<br>
            <br>
            In the real Nicaragua, no one of sound mind can fail to
            acknowledge that the country has changed a lot - to say the
            least - during the last five years. Irrefutable facts
            corroborate this development. A traveller who visited the
            country back in 2005 or 2006 - the last years of the
            previous neo-liberal administrations - and came back in 2010
            or 2011, would notice a series of important changes within
            the general setting of a poor and agro-exporting country.<br>
            <br>
            - Five or six years ago the traveller would have found
            children begging at every corner of the major cities, today
            he or she will find hardly any. <br>
            <br>
            - Back in 2005 or 2006, he or she would find a public
            transportation system in ruins based on the purchase of
            scrap buses from countries less poor than Nicaragua, today,
            in 2011, he or she will notice that those old conveyances,
            veritable Molotov cocktails on wheels, are being replaced by
            brand new ones up to today's technological standards. <br>
            <br>
            - Five or six years ago, a trip to the countryside meant a
            journey along potholed roads, today he or she will discover
            that the main roads of Nicaragua have been newly paved, and
            that in many places that before weren't connected to roads,
            new roads and highways have been built. <br>
            <br>
            - Five or six years ago, the traveller couldn't have failed
            to notice the constant, daily disruptions of basic services
            such as running water and electricity, today he or she will
            find that those are much less frequent. <br>
            <br>
            - If the traveller ventured farther into the rural areas, he
            or she will notice that many communities that before lacked
            such services today have access to them. <br>
            <br>
            - In places where five or six years ago there were only
            miserable shacks, the traveller today will notice how, here
            and there, those shacks are gradually being replaced by
            newly built, good quality houses. <br>
            <br>
            And so on...<br>
            <br>
            Moreover, all these empirical observations are endorsed by a
            plethora of international organizations with few suspicions
            of being under the influence of the Sandinistas, from the UN
            Food and Agriculture Organization, which has repeatedly
            praised the efforts of the government to ensure the
            population's access to food, to the World Health
            Organization, which has praised the Sandinistas for their
            health programs, to UNESCO, which validated the Sandinista
            government's feat of eradicating illiteracy in a few years,
            to the International Monetary Fund, which year after year
            subjects the government to exhaustive examinations in order
            to confirm the proper use of its resources, and also to
            businesses leaving less stable countries in order to invest
            in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            One can agree or not with president Daniel Ortega or the
            Sandinista Front, but one fact of reality is that the
            country today functions better than it ever did under the
            previous neo-liberal administrations.<br>
            <br>
            No fairly informed observer of US foreign policy should
            ignore that it is made up of both a public agenda and a
            corresponding hidden agenda. This is a feature of the
            behavior of most countries' governments in today&#8217;s world,
            but it is undeniably a particular trademark of US government
            behavior with respect to other nations. If that were not the
            case, the release of the diplomatic cables would not be a
            matter of such intense interest.<br>
            <br>
            For example, in May 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
            made an apparently gratuitous remark&nbsp; that Iran was
            building "the biggest embassy in Managua" - while every
            Nicaraguan (and Clinton herself) knows that the largest
            embassy here in this country is the embassy of the United
            States of America, a true high-tech fortress. The infamous
            Iranian embassy turned out to be a hospital - one that has
            now been inaugurated. <br>
            <br>
            Hillary Clinton knew this, since no specialized intelligence
            work was needed to see what was being built with the funding
            of the Iranian government. This means that the Secretary of
            State was intentionally smearing Nicaragua in order to
            construct a negative image of the country and thus to exert
            pressure on it in the hope that it would fall in with
            Washington's political objectives. She was, in other words,
            doing "public diplomacy".<br>
            <br>
            Almost all of the "reports" of Trivelli and Callahan that
            have been released so far - by the way, most of them marked
            as Confidential and almost none as Secret - are not aimed at
            producing intelligence, but to numb that of the US Congress
            and other influential groups the Department of State needs
            to manipulate in order to get their support for aggressive
            measures against a country considered "non-friendly" - to
            use an educated expression.<br>
            <br>
            The cables contain no proof and are sourced from groups of
            "Human Rights-wingers" financed by the US government for
            decades, from conversations with selected spokespersons
            among the local pro-US government right-wing, and from
            others with a similar bias. In a nutshell, sheer propaganda.<br>
            <br>
            After all, pure Information-in-itself does not exist.
            Information only acquires meaning when someone analyzes it
            from a given position that can be known and evaluated.
            Furthermore, information can only have meaning if it is
            related to other known or verifiable information. It is
            impossible to extract knowledge about the real world just
            from the assertions of Paul Trivelli and Robert Callahan.
            Ideally, an understanding of their diplomatic cables would
            mean coming to the country so as to contrast their reports
            with other data from the context to which the cables refer.<br>
            <br>
            Processing the WikiLeaks cables is not a neutral activity.
            It requires taking many decisions, such as the criteria for
            their organization, determining which cables are relevant
            and which cables are irrelevant, etcetera. The diplomatic
            cables that so far have been released on Nicaragua offer a
            glimpse of the disdainful way in which the embassy treats
            the local politicians and elites which it uses to advance US
            government objectives in the country. But the conscious or
            unconscious guiding principle behind the hierarchization of
            the released content is filtered through a demonized image
            of the Sandinistas and their foremost leader. This means
            that true information, the reality of the really existing
            country, remains out of focus and distorted.<br>
            <br>
            Presenting information is not a neutral activity either.
            Deciding who will have access to it and on what conditions,
            often pre-defines its meaning for the general public. In the
            case of Nicaragua, the privileged channel for prior access
            and subsequent mass diffusion of the cables' pre-interpreted
            and pre-digested content has been the newspaper <a
              href="http://www.elpais.com/">El Pa&iacute;s</a> from
            Spain. El Pa&iacute;s is owned by the PRISA Group, with
            strong ties to the anti-Cuban mafia in Miami and all the
            most reactionary groups of the Latin American right wing. In
            fact, over the years, El Pa&iacute;s has consistently
            supported destabilization campaigns against the ALBA
            governments of Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and
            Venezuela.<br>
            <br>
            All those decisions about access to the cables and under
            what conditions, have to do with knowledge about the world
            outside the cables themselves. For that reason, it is
            necessary to have such knowledge of the world outside
            WikiLeaks or of the people in charge of work relating to the
            cables.<br>
            <br>
            However, anonymity surrounds those doing such work which,
            one way or another, is also endorsed by the trademark
            "WikiLeaks", be it when WikiLeaks Cablegate site decides to
            publish such synopses or when a portal such as WL Central
            decides to do so. This is misleading and runs contrary to
            the ideology of openness and transparency professed by
            WikiLeaks as well as many other related projects sharing its
            ideas.<br>
            <br>
            Behind such ideologies, it is easy to notice the
            philosophical-positivist liberal bias of treating
            information as a fetish, of converting the binary series it
            is composed of as something in itself endowed with meaning,
            capable of being "liberated" independently of human systems
            created by social practices attached to economic and other
            interests that in the real world construct their meaning. <br>
            <br>
            Information may be stored in hard drives, but it is the
            human drive of social actors that bestows it with meaning.
            This is true regardless of more or less speculative
            discussion on the developments of Artificial Intelligence
            and its implications for the definition of Humanity. <br>
            <br>
            It is an undeniable fact of reality that the Internet is the
            creation of a warring imperialistic power - the US
            government - that needed a communications system capable of
            resisting a nuclear attack. Other undeniable facts are that
            still only a tiny minority of the world's population have
            access to the Internet, that a few, highly monopolistic
            governments and corporations control its information flows,
            and that these actors do everything in their power to
            control those flows and the minds that feed and consume
            them.<br>
            <br>
            The ideology that freedom of information flows like the
            waters of an unstoppable river is not neutral. For example,
            in the case of WL Central, one notices that the site offers
            <a href="http://wlcentral.org/node/2040"> "competitions"</a>
            (with payola included) financed by "donors who wish to
            remain anonymous", on "investigative journalism" based on
            the cables. As if the assertion that knowledge is a product
            of competition and narrow pecuinary interest - rather than
            resulting from collaboration, critical analysis and ambition
            to find out what is true - were not a world view, an
            ideology. Very clearly it is an ideology close to, not to
            say identical with, the most anti-humanistic and reactionary
            tendencies and, of course, pertain to the world view of the
            big monopolies WikiLeaks claims to put into question.<br>

              href="http://wlcentral.org/node/1827">Among the
              "competitions"</a> announced by WL Central, "financed by a
            donor who prefers to remain anonymous", is none other than
            "How can individuals and societies protect themselves
            against the encroachment and abuse of government power in
            the modern age?" <br>
            <br>
            It is precisely in this "modern age" that the CEOs of a
            medium-size multinational corporation, people elected by
            none beyond a small clique of major stockholders, control
            economies equivalent to the GDP of several countries. Today,
            all the realms of life have been privatized and put under
            the yoke of these corporative psychopaths whose sole
            objetive is to increase their capital. <br>
            <br>
            More and more aspects of individual and social life are
            being taken away from people and put under control of
            multi-national corporate Molochs. Despite that reality, the
            main question posed by this "donor who wishes to remain
            anonymous" is one dealing with the "abuse of government
            power".<br>
            <br>
            People interested in freedom of information and critical
            comprehension of the world who are unable to see the
            problems inherent in such ideas should leave their PCs aside
            for a while and dedicate themselves to other, more
            productive ways of relating to the world around them.<br>
            <br>
            Much has been written about WikiLeaks as a CIA operation to
            spread disinformation with the aim of confusing public
            opinion, above all, those segments of opinion prone to
            mobilize against the policies of the Western powers and
            their allies. One of the latest contributions to this debate
            is the book by Daniel Estulin (Desmontando WikiLeaks,
            Madrid, 2011, Ediciones del Bronce). It is beyond the scope
            of this article to judge the information value of WikiLeaks
            cables in general. <br>
            <br>
            So far, only a tiny fraction of this huge amount of material
            has been released. In some cases, such as with respect to
            Cuba, their content has helped to draw a clearer picture of
            the mechanisms behind US policy towards that country. <br>
            <br>
            But in other cases, they only have served to fuel
            pseudo-debates. In this sense, it is of the utmost
            importance to acknowledge the way in which the information
            contained in the cables has been made available to the
            world's public, usually by giving privileged access to big
            media monopolies with enough resources and time to
            transform, launder and work that information into
            disinformation.<br>
            <br>
            Beyond that debate, and starting from a known and knowable
            case (that of Nicaragua), we can see that the picture of
            Nicaragua conveyed by the diplomatic cables is totally alien
            to the reality lived, known and interpreted by the vast
            majority of Nicaraguans from various political and
            ideological tendencies, as well as by sober foreign
            observers.<br>
            <br>
            To Nicaraguans, the WikiLeaks cables have so far revealed
            nothing they have not already been bombarded with, and the
            ways the information has been presented to them, via outlets
            such as El Pa&iacute;s, La Prensa, El Nuevo Diario or WL
            Central, has not improved one bit their capacity to
            understand a surrounding world they already know in great
            detail.<br>
            <br>
            For the general public in the West, the Wikileaks cables on
            Nicaragua in the form in which they have been made
            available, have just added one more voice to the strident
            choir of demonizing views promoted by corporate media. In
            this case, the aim has been to co-opt the opinion of the
            many people who advocate a critical and transparent scrutiny
            of power.<br>
