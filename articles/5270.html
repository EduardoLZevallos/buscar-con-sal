<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Address by Daniel</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Good evening, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, families of Nicaragua.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Brothers and Sisters of the Police, Brothers and Sisters of the Ministry of the Interior, for you, Compañer@s, for your Families, our Respect, our Affection and our Recognition of the work that you offer to the Nicaraguan People from your Institutions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">47 years ago, on October 13th 1977, both extremes of our country were in combat, we were fighting, from San Carlos to San Fabián, and later the fighting would continue until it multiplied in all the Municipalities and all the Departments of Nicaragua.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was the People giving battle to achieve Peace, Justice and Freedom, and young people fell in that battle, especially the Youth who were at the forefront of those battles, and also Men and Women of all ages, who fought raising high the Red and Black Flag of General Sandino, so as to be able to lift the Blue and White Flag of Nicaragua out of the mud in which it lay.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was Sandino guiding the battles of the People, guiding those battles of the Sandinista Front, raising up the Red and Black Flag that he had unfurled against the Yankee Occupation; until in that Final Offensive and that date when Victory was achieved on July 19th 1979, on that day when we could proudly raise the Blue and White Flag that we had rescued from where it lay..</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Today we commemorate the 45th Anniversary of the Ministry of the Interior, when the Ministry of the Interior was a single Unit, and there was too the National Police as part of the Ministry of the Interior; there were other Security Forces too within the Ministry of the Interior. There were several offices with responsibilities in the Ministry of Interior.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Likewise, the founders of the Ministry of the Interior and the National Police came from combat in the People's Army that was organized under the Red and Black Flag of Sandino, led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">As General Avilés reminded us on the 45th Anniversary of the Founding of the Army, all this was born 45 years ago and Army combatants, Army Commanders, combatants from the Ministry of the Interior and the Police, came from fighting in the Guerrilla forces against the Somoza Dictatorship, the Somoza Tyranny, imposed by the Yankees, armed by the Yankees, trained by the Yankees, but also armed by the fascists who ruled Israel.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Here, from airplanes that Israel gave to Somoza to bomb our People, as well as naval launches, and also rifles, armaments of all kinds, Intelligence, Security, advisors; that is to say, Israel was present in this battle on the side of Tyranny, as an instrument too of the Yankee Imperialism that had imposed this Tyranny.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Today we are here, Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters, Nicaraguan families, Thanks be to God, Thanks be to Christ, enjoying Peace. We commemorate these Anniversaries in Peace, but with a Heart full of pain for everything that is happening there, precisely where the Palestinian People are and where, without the Israeli People of Israel, the People of Israel, did not even know that the Rulers of Israel were arming Somoza.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The People of Israel did not give the order to start bombing the Palestinian People. Rather it has been the ones who are in power in Israel, who are nothing but representatives of the Imperialists of the Earth, both of the United States and of Europe, all Imperialists, together now in NATO.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is amazing how at the head of the Government of Israel there is a Prime Minister who is the son of the devil. Why? Because he is carrying out a policy of terror in practice, and he is a Hitler. Yes, the Prime Minister of Israel is a Hitler, installed there, calling for the destruction of Peoples, just as the person who presides over Ukraine is another Nazi, another son of Hitler, wanting to commit NATO to a war against the Russian Federation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Hitler thought that he would win his war, and how many crimes he committed, also how many crimes against the Jewish People he committed, but then when he attacked Russia, which was the country that had to be defeated for Hitler to be able to conquer the whole planet, that was the death of Hitler. Because the Russian People, a Heroic People, a Valiant People, resisted; through heroic sieges and heroic battles, until they defeated the fascists.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We can see how people's lives and World Peace are being toyed with, what the American Rulers are doing, using Israel, arming Israel, what the American ruling élites are doing together with the European ruling élites, because these Empires are there; these Empires have joined together thinking that in this way they will be able to defeat the Peoples, but they do not realize that, in the end, they are either leading the Planet to total war, or they simply have no alternative except to await their defeat.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Wherever the Imperialists rise up, wherever the promoters of Coups d'Etat rise up, wherever Fascists rise up, they think that they are going to win the battle. That is how they express themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">But let us just remember here, how Somoza when he bombed, when he murdered, more than 50,000 dead during the whole period, and then another 50,000 dead when the Yankees armed the Counterrevolution. But here the People stood, the People defending by means of their Institutions created as a result of the Triumph.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The People, the Army, the Interior Ministry, the Police, in Unity, the Guarantee of Victory, which is what allowed us to defeat the imperialist aggression, which was condemned by the International Court of The Hague.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="250" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/404209.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Imperialists were condemned for the crimes committed against Nicaragua, for having mined the Ports of Nicaragua, such that some governments which supplied ships to ship the the oil for Nicaragua, at that time were threatened so as to cut off the oil supply. And in these extremely difficult conditions, who extended their hand to the People of Nicaragua? Comandante Fidel.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I remember that I went to talk to Comandante Fidel, I told him the situation is really critical, because they are blocking the entry of oil to us. And Comandante Fidel told me: We'll do the following: We'll talk to the Leaders of the Socialist Countries, which were then grouped with the Soviet Union but had their Autonomy, they had their Governments, their Presidents.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We'll talk to them, said Fidel, I am in charge of talking with them and I'll propose that each of us put a quota of oil, and first of all I am going to discuss this with Russia. So Comandante Fidel did so, and the answer came, the response came from this Community of Countries who decided to maintain our oil supply.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And Fidel said to me: And I'll tell them that Cuba will do its part too; Cuba, with all the difficulties it was facing, with the blockade already in place, but Cuba is also going to do its part. That is, by requesting Solidarity for the People of Nicaragua, whom Comandante Fidel loved and respected very much, for the this People.'s Heroism.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">As I was telling you, of course, the Imperialists have affected us with what they call Sanctions, but we have been able to count on the Cooperation, with the unconditional Solidarity of Fraternal Peoples, of Fraternal Governments, such as the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; and Cuba is always there cooperating despite the difficulties it is going through, and all of this allows us to enjoy Peace and Stability.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">But, on the other hand, we cannot feel at peace just because we have Peace and Stability, because that would be selfish; we have to engage the struggle, give battle, to put an end to the genocide being committed against the Palestinian People, being committed against neighboring Peoples, in neighboring Nations, and denounce, as already in many European Countries, their Peoples are denouncing, the terrorist policy promoted by their Governments.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">For they are even installing atomic weapons in highly sensitive areas so as to provoke the Russian Federation, when they know that the Russian Federation has atomic weapons. And while the Russian Federation has not allowed itself to be provoked, it is clear that it is not going to let itself be attacked either, nor is it going to allow a humiliation like the one that the NATO leaders seek to promote.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Today, on this 45th Anniversary, we greet the Delegation of the Sister People's Republic of China. In fact, there is the Ambassador, already well known to all of us, the Ambassador, and so there is, he has come from afar, just as the ship came, the first ship to cross from China to Nicaragua to disembark in our port, to disembark not weapons, but to disembark equipment so as to continue building Houses, Roads, everything that we are building here in Nicaragua. The Imperialists dislike that, they really don't like it, they get upset.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And with the Delegation headed by the Deputy Director of the International Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Public Security, Compañero Zhou Zhaohui, also there is the Deputy Director of the Public Security Department of Guangdong Province, Huang Guohui; and too the Director of the International Cooperation Department of Public Security of Guangdong Province, Yan Bo.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Also, the Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the Public Security Department of Guangdong Province, Li Pengcheng.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And we are accompanied as well by the Official of the Department of International Cooperation of Public Security of Guangdong Province, Compañero Huang Hao, also with his interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">How much we appreciate this gesture from President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party of China, and its People. Our Greetings, our Affection, our Recognition and Gratitude for all the Cooperation, with no conditions, which the Chinese People and Government are providing to Nicaragua.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, also here with us are the Director of the Center, accompanying Compañera Svetlana Petrova, there is Colonel Vladimir Alexandrovich Tsilik, Director of the Specialized Training Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

We recognize your effort, Brothers and Sisters, compañeros and compañeras of the Russian Federation, of President Putin, to maintain this Center together with the cooperation the Russian Federation offers to the Nicaraguan people.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And here presiding, Compañera Rosario has already introduced us to; Compañera María Amelia Coronel, Minister of the Interior; First Commissioner Francisco Javier Díaz Madriz, Director General of the National Police, from whom we have heard reports, a review, very firm, very sure.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="250" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/404131.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">How the Police Offices for Women have grown, how they have multiplied throughout the country, and they continue to multiply, there are no days that Police Offices for Women are not being inaugurated, to protect women and to give security also to all our Families.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our Brother Compañero Gustavo Porras, President of the National Assembly; our Brother Army General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Commander-in-Chief of the Nicaraguan Army. And then there are the delegations we mentioned. Well, there is our beloved Brother Luis Cañas Novoa, Minister of the Interior. These are individuals who hardly sleep, indeed, because they have to work 24 hours a day.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our Brother, Commissioner General Horacio Sebastián Rocha, Minister Advisor to the Presidency; Major General Bayardo Ramón Rodríguez Ruiz, Chief of the General Staff of our Nicaraguan Army; Major General Marvin Elías Corrales Rodríguez, Inspector General of our Nicaraguan Army. Then we have here Compañera Carla Eugenia Salinas, Deputy Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Well, this is the Presidium and we have also mentioned many of the compañeros who are visiting on this historic occasion, accompanying the National Police, accompanying the People of Nicaragua.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">45 Years, and we went through a critical period as General Diaz reminded us. There were 17 years of Neoliberal governments which wanted to do away with the Police and the Army, and that's when they started dismantling the Ministry of the Interior as well. They thought they would be there for 100 years, 200 years, who knows how many years they thought they were going to be there; they did not expect the People to decide again to take over the Government, to take Power as the People President, for a People that has known how to face difficult moments, bitter moments, and that has learned how to be creative.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And we are seeing this, how productive activities are developing in our country, how productive activities are multiplying, not only productive activities in the agricultural field, but also small businesses, small commercial enterprises, how they are multiplying; how schools are multiplying, how Universities are multiplying, how Hospitals and Clinics are multiplying in order to serve our Families.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Thus, when you go to a hospital, or a School or a University, you don't have to pay a penny there. These are Universities, these are Hospitals, these are Schools that are there to serve People, to serve our People, to serve Families who can't afford to go to a hospital, those hospitals where, just to get in, they ask you to put down thousands and thousands. And these free hospitals have multiplied.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And housing has also multiplied, Housing Programs that we had been pushing forward with great effort and that have been reinforced with the Housing Programs that the People's Republic of China provides us. Not to mention the roads, the roads.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">All this logically follows the policy of attacking Extreme Poverty and Poverty, because housing is a Human Right that cannot be denied to anyone, and as long as we still have Families in conditions of Extreme Poverty, living on the banks of the waterways, or in shacks, with plastic or bits of tin for a roof, we are not going to be satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Rather, we are ashamed and it hurts us, and we have to keep striving until every Family in Nicaragua has Decent Housing, has Decent Living Conditions, has Decent Work, and then we can say that now we can all live here in Peace, when we all have Decent Conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Thank God we have been moving in that direction and we have been moving at great speed, for which Security is basic so that these Works can be developed, because, otherwise, if there is no security, if there is no surveillance, the materials that are there to build houses suddenly disappear. All of a sudden from there. Or what is being used to build Schools or to build Hospitals, all that has to be taken care of, under the protection of the Police; as well as protecting our Children, our young people, when they enter and leave their Schools.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">That is to say, everything comes together here. Everything is combined, to what end? To allow us to achieve our goal, which is for Nicaragua to be free from Extreme Poverty and Poverty. And that will then allow us to say that better basic conditions of life are now being achieved, but without forgetting the Peoples who are struggling because they are being murdered, as is happening with the Palestinian People.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Brothers and Sisters, Compañeros and Compañeras of the National Police, of the Ministry of the Interior, of Governance, for all of you our Recognition for the work you do. It is a job that demands great discipline, great effort, great dedication, in which we recognize how your Families accompany you, being clear that you run risks, such as the Brothers and Sisters of our Police killed by the coup plotters, or Brothers and Sisters of our Police who have died in accidents.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And there too we have a fundamental point address, namely, how we can work more and better to avoid traffic accidents, to avoid Citizens, compañeros, compañeras riding motor bikes, after drinking, and then end up in a crash. These are people's lives! And how families suffer, how mothers suffer, how children suffer, how widows suffer, in the face of these deaths.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">So then we have to join forces, work with greater intensity, to get the deaths down... An effort is being made, but we have to redouble our efforts, combining efforts with the Community, combining efforts with the population, with young people, so that these deaths due to traffic accidents do not continue to occur.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">For all of you, Brothers and Sisters, our Recognition, we know that the work you do is invaluable. And we congratulate the compañeros and compañeras who, depending on the time they have already spent in service, are now passing to higher ranks, even if they do not have positions of responsibility, because it is impossible for everyone to have an official post.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In other words, one cannot make the distinction that in order to move to a higher rank, the number of years of service, spent in service is not enough, but that one must also have a official post... No! When the established time of service is reached, the compañero, the compañera should pass to the next rank up, which they more than deserve.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And just as you have sworn today, for our Heroes, for our Martyrs, we will continue fighting for Peace, we are going to continue fighting for Life, we are going to continue fighting against Poverty, we are going to continue fighting for the Health, for the Education of our People. That is a Sacred Commitment of the National Police, that is a Sacred Commitment of the Ministry of the Interior, that is a Sacred Commitment that all of you Brothers and Sisters, before God, before our People, raise our hand and swear that we are going to fulfill our Duty to contribute to this Struggle for Peace, for Security, for the Life of all Nicaraguans.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live the National Police!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live the Ministry of the Interior!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live the Families of all of you beloved Brothers and Sisters!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live the Mothers of all you beloved Brothers and Sisters!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Sandino Lives on, the Struggle Continues!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Free Nation or Death!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live Blessed and Forever Free Nicaragua!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>after the Central Celebration of the 45th Anniversary<br />
of the Ministry of the Interior and National Police</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>October 14th 2024</b><br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Good evening. These are Days of Pride, National Pride, Pride of our National Dignity, of our National Decorum, as our General of Free Men and Women used to say. Days to celebrate ourselves, as victors, because Peace has triumphed and triumphs here, which is a Gift from God.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We are Blessed, we are a Blessed People, we defend Peace as we have been defending it and that is the Greatest Blessing. Because Peace also means Security, and Peace for us is Love for God, above all things; love among ourselves, as His People.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is true, every day we feel more strongly that our Future is Blessed, because it is the People, through all their Revolutionary, Evolutionary Institutions, who are our guarantee as a People, guaranteeing that every day is one of progress, in a Country that lives Secure, Proud, Calm and in Harmony, because we are a People of Faith. And after all, what is this faith that animates us...? To be able to live in Peace and well being. To be able to guarantee the Rights of Everyone for the Good of Everyone. To be able to truly feel like Brothers and Sisters.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Fraternity, Solidarity, the basis of Christianity; Kindness, Generosity, Joy... The Joy of living in Peace! For which, how much we owe to our Institutions of Sovereign Security and Citizen Security, because everything we have is precisely because we are conscious of our National Sovereignty.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Because the Empires have wanted to destroy us, the Empires have wanted to subdue us, absorb us, dominate us, but we are conscious of our National Sovereignty, and we defend it. Because it is via that National Sovereignty that, each day, we install more and more Affection, more and more Brotherhood, and, above all, more and more Victorious Ways of solving those problems bequeathed to us by the envious, the greedy, those people full of hatred who have filled the world with injustice, disorder, crimes, genocide.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We already know... On the one hand, we thank God because Peace blooms here, it grows green, it blooms every day, but we are aware that we do not live in a World of Peace as we would like to, nor do we live in a World of Respect as we would like to, nor do we live in a World of Justice, of True Truths, as we would like to.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">But we continue to strive, because the aspiration of the Human Spirit is to live in a Fraternal, Supportive, Complementary World, a Just World, a New World, which is the one now being born, the one that has been born with a lot of sacrifice by our Peoples. But it's now, it's already here, it's dawning, the New Sun is rising. That Sun is the one illuminating all of so many New Victories.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our Recognition to the Institutions that support us as a People, because they are of the People and come from the People, guaranteeing us Security, Tranquility and Peace, Harmony, Rights.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our recognition to the National Police who contribute so much, who have contributed so much and who have been able to proudly defend our Flags, our Blue and White, Red and Black, National Flags, Flags precisely of National Sovereignty and Dignity.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our recognition to our Army, to our Ministry of the Interior... We are all of the People, we come from the People, we come from the Struggles for National Dignity which have made us solid, because they are not artificial institutions. They are Real Institutions!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When I glance through the pages of Hatred, I can only say: What world is that? What country are they talking about? That country exists only in their evil, perverse minds. This Country is a Country where Faith reigns, where Affection reigns, one of drawing together, above all with the desire to prosper, because we have the Right to prosper.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">That false world, devised by those who have tried to destroy us, all the time plundering us, that World is false. It exists for them, but not for the majority of Nicaraguans who see their progress every day, who go to Hospitals, to Health Centers, who circulate on new Roads and Bridges that reduce journey time, the time we spend traveling distances, and that also guarantee or should guarantee us more security.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">That is also why the call made by Comandante Daniel to be cautious, and also responsible; responsible and cautious in the use of those Roads; because the Roads are good some promote that we take it for granted and speed so that more disasters are generated. Because every accident is a disaster, especially for Families who lose Loved Ones, or for People who are left with all the different consequences in their Lives.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">But anyway, back to the real world... In this real world that we inhabit, we strive, continually to overcome. In this real World that we inhabit, we are Brothers and Sisters and, too, in Solidarity with the Peoples of the World, who also struggle to overcome, to strive to overcome.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We are brothers and sisters and we know that the Future is ours, that God has given us the Strength of Spirit to transcend. That is why we have been able to face, victoriously, triumphantly, every aggression, including those of more recent times. Undeserved aggression against Nicaragua's Families who were celebrating, as we are celebrating again, Thanks be to God, jubilantly, Reconciliation, which has returned, which will continue to reign, because here we are Christians, we are Socialists, we are inspired with Solidarity , and we say: Let Jesus Reign Forever, the Prince of Peace!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Peace is our Treasure, Security is our Treasure, and it is also the Solid Ground on which we are building the Future every day, Free from Poverty, Free from Misery, Free also from Spiritual Poverty, from Spiritual Uncertainty, from Spiritual Misery, because that too disrupts and aims to destroy. But it does not succeed, because we are strengthened by the Word of God.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">These are Supreme Truths that we realize and make concrete, in our Blessed Nicaragua. It is the Gift of God that reigns in our Nicaragua, it is Jesus Christ Our Lord, and we can celebrate all our Traditions, not only in Plenitude, not only with Freedom, but by living our Devotion intensely, as it should be; genuinely, not artificially, not with poses, but with True Truths.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">So, with the Blessing of our Heavenly Father and following our Christian, Socialist and Solidarity based Paths, Let Us Go Onward. We have the strength of Spirit to continue fighting and overcoming poverty.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Warm embraces and Congratulations to all the Compañeros and Compañeras who today celebrate this Anniversary of Triumphs, and our Thoughts for the Relatives, the Families, the Brothers and Sisters, the Children, the Grandchildren, the Mothers, recently made to grieve by those servants of demons and of the devil.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">To all the People, Families, Communities, who have lived through, because we have indeed lived the grief of losing Loved Ones, thanks to the death and destruction they wanted to sow; to everyone our Solidarity, our Respect, but also the Recognition that we are here, thanks to that Sacred Blood that fills us all with Strength, and the Future, the Always Further On of our General Sandino, that is ours by Decree of the Heavenly Father.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Warm embraces, Compañeros and Compañeras... Let Us Go Onward! Tomorrow we have the Display “All of Us are Peace”, what a Great Truth this is! If we were not all of us Beings of Peace, there would be no Peace and we are all fully convinced that Peace is indispensable to advance along the Paths of Justice, Rights, Love, Reconciliation and Solidarity.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Warm embraces, Compañeros and Compañeras.</p>
