<p><i>"Then Sandino crossed the forest</i></p>

<p><i>unleashing his sacred gunpowder</i></p>

<p><i>against the bandit marines</i></p>

<p><i>reared and paid for by New York,</i></p>

<p><i>the earth burned, the bush resounded:</i></p>

<p><i>the Yankee did not expect what happened:</i></p>

<p><i>he was very well dressed for war</i></p>

<p><i>his shoes shone bright and his guns,</i></p>

<p><i>but experience soon taught him</i></p>

<p><i>who Sandino was and what Nicaragua was.</i></p>

<p><i>Sandino and Nicaragua: everything became</i></p>

<p><i>a tomb for  the blond thieves:</i></p>

<p><i>the air, the trees, the trails, the water.</i></p>

<p><i>Sandino's guerrillas would spring</i></p>

<p><i>even from their open whisky jars</i></p>

<p><i>and they fell ill with sudden death</i></p>

<p><i>the glorious warriors of Louisiana</i></p>

<p><i>accustomed to hanging Negros</i></p>

<p><i>to show their superhuman bravery:</i></p>

<p><i>two thousand hooded men busy</i></p>

<p><i>with a single Negro, a noose and a gallows-tree.</i></p>

<p><i>Here things were different:</i></p>

<p><i>Sandino would rush them, then wait,</i></p>

<p><i>Sandino was the night that fell</i></p>

<p><i>and the glare off the sea that killed them,</i></p>

<p><i>Sandino was a turret with banners,</i></p>

<p><i>Sandino was a rifle firing hope.</i></p>

<p><i>The lessons were very different,</i></p>

<p><i>from West Point where the teaching was clean:</i></p>

<p><i>they never taught them at school</i></p>

<p><i>that the one out there killing could also die:</i></p>

<p><i>the Americans did not learn</i></p>

<p><i>that we love our beloved, impoverished land</i></p>

<p><i>and that we will defend the banners</i></p>

<p><i>created with pain and love.</i></p>

<p><i>They may not have learned that in Philadelphia</i></p>

<p><i>but they learned it in blood in Nicaragua:</i></p>

<p><i>there the captain of the people was waiting:</i></p>

<p><i>his name was Augusto C. Sandino.</i></p>

<p><i>And his name will remain in this song </i></p>

<p><i>stupendous as a flame</i></p>

<p><i>bestowing us the light and the fire</i></p>

<p><i>to continue his battles".</i></p>

<p>We are here to celebrate ourselves as a People of God, as a People with the Right to Peace, with Sovereign Rights, with the Right to our Freedom, our Sisterhood and Brotherhood, cultivated amidst the most brutal aggression of North American imperialism, which has greedily and wantonly occupied Nicaragua, humiliating Nicaraguan Families, using those who lend themselves to be used, those who sell out their Nation, those who betray their nation, with the infamous aim of destroying our Culture, plundering our Natural Patrimony and snatching from us the Concord that we defend and will continue to defend, with Pure Hearts. And we know that they could not do so , nor will they !</p>

<p>We fight against Poverty, which is Hatred, a crime against humanity, and we fight so that its promoters drop the hatred that these days they impose with methods they are innovative or unconventional, and that we refuse to qualify as "soft" or "colorful", because nothing is suave, light or colorful, in the fetid, benighted lairs where the Colonialists and Imperialists of the Earth plot their crimes...</p>

<p>We fight against Poverty and we strive to make our way, all together, step by step, with the serene Wisdom of our Ideals and Values of Christianity, Sister and Brotherhood and Solidarity, serving, in the case of Public Servants, from institutions representing the Pure People, Pure People, all Nicaraguan Families, without distinction, our invincible, great Nicaraguan Families, who with their hands, embody the Divine Spirit, with their hands, with their Intelligence, which is Divine Breath, work the Earth, sow, cultivate, harvest, together with Artisans, Entrepreneurs, Merchants, Educators, Doctors, Specialists, Workers, Health Workers, Communicators, Professionals, Technicians, Heads of Households and Families, Men and Women, and so many intelligent people so many intelligent and ard working people of Good Will, who with Talent and Dedication, generate the wealth that is distributed to create more Work, more Stability, more Security, from our growing and aware self-respect which is what makes us free. ..</p>

<p>We fight against Poverty, and we make progress, studying, learning, starting businesses, producing, singing, creating, taking care of our health, and valuing our Identity, our Cultures, our Libertarian Model, of solidarity oriented and complementary initiative, which is a rainbow that distinguishes us and defends us...</p>

<p>We work hard to overcome Poverty, and God blesses the paths of People of Goodwill, dedicated, hardworking and devoted to Love, Family, Work and Peace...</p>

<p>God blesses all our Paths, we are full of redemptive and liberating inspiration, of Sacred Faith, of Love on a grand scale, of being honorable, having Integrity, Joy, Faith, Enthusiasm, Justice and Peace...</p>

<p>With our great People engaged in our great battles, mobilizing all our Energies, our Creativity, our Visionary, Vibrant, Tender, Lucid Spirituality, and always grounded in our transit through these Planes of Life, we feel more and more certain, secure, and full of restoring and stimulating confidence, in the paths of Peace, Blessedness and Victories...</p>

<p>In this 42/19 with the Love that triumphs and overcomes, and with this passionate, sincere, enthusiastic, sensitive, committed, joyful and loving Youth, with all the goodness we are creating, and which we will continue to create, filling us with infinite Pride...</p>

All of us gathered together make up this Dignified, Revolutionary, Evolutionary People.... We are a Great People, with Respect, demanding of Respect, an irrevocable demand of Respect from outsiders; Respect for what we have been, Respect for what we are, and for what, sensing all this force of Youth, God willing, we are going to continue being, so that Nicaragua will be more and more a place of Christianity, Liberty, Dignity, Fraternity, Family and Solidarity...</p>

<p><b>Daniel's address</b></p>

<p>Good evening, Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers, beloved Families, beloved Youth, beloved Children of this Blessed Land;</p>

<p>Beloved invited guests to this Concert, a Concert of Love and Peace, a Concert with the Vice President of the Republic, Rosario Murillo, grand-niece of our General Sandino.</p>

<p>Today I spoke with Blanquita, with Blanca Arauz, because every time I speak with Blanquita here, who is the daughter of Blanca and General Sandino, I feel that I am speaking with Blanca Arauz and with the General himself.</p>

<p>So I tell Blanquita, and she is always in touch with greetings and sending encouragement. In truth, every time I talk to her, as I have told her, I feel that she fills me with the Energy of General Sandino and Blanca Arauz. Our Greetings to all the Family of Sandino.</p>

<p>Our Greetings to the Chancellor of the Republic of Abkhazia... Welcome, Dear Brother! Comrade Kove Daur, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Abkhazia. It is a small Nation, but with Dignity, one that has known how to defend its Self-Determination and its Sovereignty, and one that can count on the total Solidarity of the Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p>Do take our Greetings to the President and his People, since we have read here, and we have listened to the President's Message, for which we thank him.</p>

<p>Well, here Compañera Rosario has already introduced Compañero Gustavo, President of the National Assembly; Compañera Maritza, Vice President. There goes the combination of men and women, which has given us a worthy place in the World; Nicaragua is ranked the fifth country in the World in compliance with this principle.</p>

<p>We are accompanied by Army General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Brother, Compañero. We are also accompanied by the First Commissioner General Francisco Díaz, of the National Police, Brother, Compañero; Doctor Alba Luz Ramos, President of the Supreme Court of Justice; Compañera Doctor Wendy Morales, Attorney General of the Republic. And I will pause for a moment here with Wendy. I asked Wendy right now to update me on the data we have, regarding the issuing of Property Titles, from 2007 to date.</p>

<p>This Revolution, which is one made by the Poor for the Poor, which is one made by Peasants for the Peasants, which is of the Workers, for the Workers, has already distributed, as of today, 501,380 urban and rural Property Titles.</p>

<p>And we continue doing so, we continue, and we will continue, delivering Property Titles, until in our Nation we have all Nicaraguans, who have their modest house, who have their plot of land, who have their homes, their modest houses, who have their small farm, all with their Property Title registered in the Land Registry, because after receiving the Title, it has to be registered in the Land Registry, because otherwise it is of little value. It is necessary to take that step, and that is the task that corresponds to Wendy, which is to take the title to the Land Registry, and when the property is already noted in the Land Registry, no thieving landowner who wants to will be able to steal that property from the farmer.</p>

<p>Well, I was telling you that we are accompanied by two of the nation's Heroines. In the struggle, when they were very young girls, let's see how old Brenda would have been at the time of the attack on Las Minas... How old were you, Brenda? Brenda was 15 years old, 15 years old, and there she fought against  the mercenaries, the criminals, the terrorists of the Yankee Government, and there she received a hail of bullets, and she survived, thank God, and now she is the head of the Supreme Electoral Council. Brenda brings honor to the Institution.</p>

<p>We are also accompanied by another heroine... Alma Nubia Baltodano, how old were you, Alma Nubia, when you were a victim in the struggle? Because you were fighting and you were a victim too... 16 years old. That's when you lost both your hands, Alma Nubia, and Brenda lost her arm. And now she is also in the Supreme Electoral Council.</p>

<p>Two Heroines of our Nation! They were Heroines as girls, when they were 15 and 16 years old. They did not retreat, they did not surrender, but defended the Nation.</p>

<p>We are also accompanied by the brothers of the Army General Command, Major General Bayardo Ramon Rodriguez, Chief of Staff, and Inspector General, Major General Marvin Corrales Rodriguez.</p>

<p>On behalf of the National Police we are also accompanied by Commissioner General Adolfo Marenco and Commissioner General Ramón Avellán, another Hero, who resisted the provocations, bullets, deaths, there in Masaya. And how difficult at that moment it must have been to have to tell the comrades there, don't shoot, resist, hold on, don't shoot. And the terrorists, firing hails of bullets, financed by the Yankees and the oligarchy, attacking every day. It was pure provocation, they wanted the police to react and for a massacre to take place. Because it is false that they had the police cornered there, the police were simply carrying out an order to resist, without firing a shot, orders which are most difficult to carry out when an institution is under attack, when a command post is under attack. And they resisted and finally the attackers were defeated, when the decision was taken, they were defeated with the stroke of a pen, they were defeated with the stroke of a pen, those who thought they were overthrowing the Institutions of the Nicaraguan State.</p>

<p>And well, we salute all these young people.... I never tire of saying and repeating that phrase of our great Master Rubén Darío: Youth Divine Treasure! Youth Divine Treasure! And how much Darío teaches all of us, in terms of what is, I would say is the most important thing, the defense of Human Dignity.</p>

<p>There is a poem by Darío called "Afternoon at the Bullring"; the bullring is one of those very elegant structures in Spain, parts of France, in Mexico, and Darío describes a bullfight there, there they are very elegant, they do not resemble ours. It is the dialogue between the Bull and the Ox; that is to say, they are there, in the same corral, the Bull and the Ox: The Bull that is there to go out to fight  the bullfighter, and the Ox that is there to be used later to drag away the garbage.</p>

<p>And the Bull is worried, and says to the Ox: I was so powerful there in the pampa, in the field, how I fought against the panthers, against the lions, there I defeated them in the field, there I was free. The Bull was so Proud! But he ends up telling the Ox: But now they are shouting out there, "another bull!" The people shouting, "another bull!" And that means death, he says. The Bull is worried because he sees death near at hand.</p>

<p>And they continue talking, the Bull with the Ox, and the Ox comments that he was also as free as the Bull when they had not castrated him and had not turned him into an Ox; he was as free as the Bull there roaming the countryside, but when they castrated him, says the Ox, then they left me totally impotent, only good to go around carrying firewood, to go around carrying water, to go around carting garbage.</p>

<p>Then, the Bull does not pay much attention to the Ox, he is simply thinking that they are going to kill him, and the Bull says to the Ox: But don't you realize that they are going to kill me, in a few seconds they are going to kill me? And the Bull demands of the Ox: And what could be more terrible than death? And the Ox replies: Impotence, he says, impotence!</p>

<p>That was where our General Sandino knew what path to take: Either he fell into surrender, into impotence, into slavery, or he faced death, defending the Sovereignty of the Homeland, defending the Nicaraguan People, as our General Sandino knew how to do.</p>

<p>And these are the Battles we still have to fight today in this World, a World that is more and more perturbed by the pretensions of the North American leaders, wanting to impose their hegemony, wanting to become Masters and Lords of the Planet, even wanting to take over the Universe. Their plans really do go that far, because they have atomic bombs, because they have a lot of money, and they do not completely understand that this current stage, where Imperialism had a period that was temporary, a period of hegemony, when the balance between the Soviet Union and the United States was broken, that this moment of hegemony they had, was just a few seconds, and has disappeared.</p>

<p>Now Peoples throughout the world are struggling; the American People are struggling, courageously the American People are struggling, and the European Peoples are also struggling. In other words, those countries that still dream of imposing their colonialist, neocolonialist policies on the world are simply out of touch with reality. That is no longer possible. The only way ahead is for them to understand once and for all, that when the Universe was created, and in the Universe, well, the Earth was created, and there was no God that said: The Yankees must be the owners of the World. Neither in Africa, nor in Asia, nor in our American Lands where our ancestors, our roots were. There was a multitude of gods venerated by the different Cultures, and no god said "We must submit to the Yankee Empire".</p>

<p>Usually we affirm that the Will of God is expressed by the People, it is the Will of the People, and no People wants oppression, just as no Nicaraguan Family would like to have their Rights taken away, as they were taken away in the past, to Healthcare, to Education, when they were evicted from their homes and had their lands stolen, to be left without work, to have Healthcare and Education privatized. No Nicaraguan family wants that!</p>

<p>Even those Nicaraguan families that for various reasons are unable to understand the struggle for dignity, for justice, which has to do with their own material realities, those families are also victims. Namely, the people who oppose us, because there are people who oppose us, as a result of the fierce propaganda that exists, and they live in poverty.</p>

<p>But when they see a new highway come along they are happy, and they do not get upset because it is the Government of the People-President building that highway. And when a Clinic is built there and a Hospital is built there, as dozens of Hospitals have been built in these years, clinics for Women, the doors are open to all Nicaraguan Families. They are not clinics or hospitals only for Sandinista families.... They are clinics and hospitals for all Nicaraguan families!</p>

<p>Therefore this is a very complex struggle, because it is a struggle that has to do with the global interests of an Empire that wants to dominate all countries. It wants to subjugate great powers, instead of reaching an understanding with the great powers it wants to subjugate them. It wants to subjugate the Russian Federation, it wants to subordinate it. It wants to subjugate, it wants to subordinate the People's Republic of China. They are mad! They are completely mad!</p>

<p>They want to subjugate the great powers and they also want to subjugate nations, like Nicaragua, because we are located in a strategic point, and that is the origin of the Yankee persecution of Nicaragua. Because here there is only one gigantic resource, namely the inter-oceanic Canal through Nicaragua. And they do not want it, they have never wanted it, since Nicaragua came into existence they have imposed treaties so that Nicaragua could not sign any agreement with any country in the world, even in Europe, if the US did not authorize it. They gave themselves rights over all our territory, because our governments then sold out Nicaragua, the Yankees gave themselves the right to say to the Europeans, you cannot enter here, we, the United States, the Yankee Empire, decide about the Canal here.</p>

<p>We are in the midst of that battle in this current struggle, and it is a struggle, yes, in which we are making progress. I am not going to make a long review of the various situations we have faced and of which we have spoken constantly; what I can simply say is that, in spite of the Empire's attempts to destroy our country, Nicaragua is still here standing firm and moving forward.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that they have wanted to destroy the country's economy, and they have assassinated people, sowing terror, implementing terrorism in Nicaragua, they have laundered millions of millions of dollars in Nicaragua to sow terrorism, and at the moment our authorities are examining the accounts via the investigations being carried out into the notorious foundations and the millions that have appeared here and there, millions, we are talking about millions of dollars to be used to try and destroy the Nicaraguan People. And they have failed. In spite of the pandemic that is affecting the whole world, that affects us, that affects the global economy, that affects labor, employment, etc., here in Nicaragua the tendency is for our economy to be more stable every day, to be stronger every day.</p>

<p>And how upset they get when they hear reports from International Organizations, recognizing that Nicaragua is doing well economically, that Nicaragua is investing very well and quickly executing funding programs to do with Health Centers, Hospitals, Highways, Schools, Productive Activities, and Businesses.</p>

<p>This does not need to be repeated here, because all of you Nicaraguan brothers and sisters see it, you see it in your neighborhood, you see it in your municipality, you see it in your department, how every day there are more roads, better roads; how the economy is growing; how farmers are being trained, how they are given the tools to improve productivity in rura areas</p>

<p>And after the blows we have had, because we had the April terrorist coup when they wanted to put an end to the Revolution; then we had the pandemic; then the aggression they call Sanctions, how many aggressions have they not launched against Nicaragua? But in spite of all these aggressions our Economy continues to grow.</p>

<p>And good news...! Our Minister of Finance, Comrade Ivan Acosta, is currently in Moscow, he is on a State Visit there in Moscow. And before leaving we had already talked, working out the calculations, he is an extraordinary Sandinista, a former member of the Army, an Army Officer, a very well prepared Scientific-Technical cadre.</p>

<p>And well, we were talking about how to deal with salaries, because we have spent a long time without being able to increase salaries to what they should be, due to the difficult situation, and what did we agree? Here what we have to guarantee is employment, work, and so for a while we could not increase salaries, because if we increased salaries then people would have to go to unemployment. We have talked about this issue with all the Labor Union Leaders, with the Workers, and they have understood in solidarity, and have endured with Dignity.</p>

<p>And today, on this 42/19, we can announce with all pride, that thanks to this People, as of August, a budget adjustment of 5% will be implemented; this covers of course Basic Salaries, Seniority, Other Accruals, Christmas Bonus, Employer's Contributions, and INATEC. 5%!</p>

<p>In other words, we are going to end this year and start next year with this increase. How have we achieved this? From discipline in controlling expenses and in tax collection. And this shows that those who have been making calls not to work, those business people who have been talking about closing down their companies, simply do not close down themselves, because they know they are making money, and if they were not making money, they would not be paying the taxes they are paying.</p>

<p>Tax policy is always difficult, that is why they call it Taxation, because it is obligatory; if it is not obligatory, nobody would pay tax, but where are we going to get resources for Schools, for Health Centers, for Hospitals, for Medicines?</p>

<p>So we have managed to work with great discipline, and these business people, who "curse the cow but drink the milk", have had no choice but to continue working, because they know they are doing well; the day they are not doing well, they close the plant and leave, but as long as they are doing ok, then we will see them there, even if they are complaining, even when they complain, they are doing well; what's really happening is that they are wretches and have no sensitivity for the People.</p>

<p>I would say that, already in this Event, in this Concert, in which we are being accompanied by all of Nicaragua, because this is being transmitted all over Nicaragua, in all the television channels this Act is being transmitted, and those who are out in the communities, in the rural areas, there and in other places are people who may criticize us, or who do not sympathize politically with us, but they know that we are speaking the Truth, they know very well that we are speaking the Truth, they are well aware of the new road passing by their house, they are well aware of the electricity reaching their community and of the piped water reaching their community, all of them know it perfectly well, and that we are raising productivity in their agricultural sector.</p>

<p>And I would say that, in this 42/19, our commitment continues with the Heroes, with the Martyrs, with their Sacred Blood. For them, with them and with their example we have to continue pressing forward, we have to continue fighting, with a United People, because a United People will never be defeated! And with a people in arms too, because the people in arms will never be crushed!</p>

<p>Here we have an Army that is here to protect our National Sovereignty and also to contribute to Security and the fight against organized crime, against drug trafficking. And we have a Police that is also fully dedicated to the fight for Citizen Security. That is why I say to you, a United People will never be defeated! And the a People in Arms will never be crushed!</p>

<p>Long Live 42/19!</p>

<p>I want to conclude by congratulating, as I have already congratulated him personally, "El Guadalupano", our Brother. Really, he was feeling too ill to come, and we insisted, but he has been suffering ill health, as one might expect, from his illnesses, his health problems; he has received care, but he was feeling very unwell. And when I went to greet him he told me: "But we are here, because we had to be here, we just had to be here!" "El Guadalupano", a thousand percent Sandinista.</p>

<p>And congratulations to all these young people, this new generation of artists. Here no artist is indispensable, because Nicaragua has an enormous production of Artists, of Creators, with great cultural riches, with a great vital force and with an immense Soul to sing to its People. Our Congratulations to our beloved Artists. And well, Ramón is already forming more Artists, more young people.... Congratulations Ramón, who is always there promoting the Theater Ruben Darío.</p>

<p>Long Live 42/19!</p>

<p>Sandino Lives On, the Struggle Continues!</p>

<p>A Free Nation or Death!</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the 42nd Anniversary Ceremony of the Sandinista Popular Revolution</b></p>

<p><b>July 19, 2021</b></p>

<p>Good evening, Compañer@s; beloved, and dear Families of our Blessed Nicaragua, Always Blessed, Always Dignified, Always Sovereign, Always Full of Love, and therefore Always Free !</p>

<p>We are very moved, as always, by the Strength of our People, always able to Overcome... Moved and Proud that we are part of that Spiritual Force that does Overcome.</p>

<p>What would we Nicaraguans, do if God were not in each and every one of us, guiding our Lives? That is our Strength, that is the Sun that does not set, that encourages us, that illuminates us, and as a Blessed, Hard Working People, a People that from Dawn to Dusk works, in the Name of Jesus, to advance, to prosper, so we feel infinitely honored to be very much part of this Nicaragua that every day, step by step, attains new Victories.</p>

<p>We feel excited, moved, joyful, happy, enthusiastic, and passionate. look how much enthusiasm, how much Joy, how much Passion, Revolutionary and Evolutionary, we have seen during these days. It is a Force that rises spontaneously, but also one cultivated by this Historical Legacy.</p>

<p>In these Times we live in, this Force that is growing everywhere, because we are growing, is a mirror and reflection of an Evolving Historical Consciousness of National Sovereignty. And that is why we are moved, and content, when we see so much Youth, a Youth that raises its Banners with Pride, a Youth that sings, that studies, that loves, and that shows, in its face, in its smile, the Conviction, the Good Heart and Pride of being Nicaraguan, by the Grace of God!</p>

<p>And today, 42/19, our Commander has given the Good News of what is possible when the economy is managed with Responsibility, Sensitivity and Solidarity: a salary increase that will improve a little bit or contribute to improving Life for Everyone.</p>

<p>And one may think, well, as Daniel said, there are people who may not agree with some things, or with everything, because Human Beings are like that; but, how could anyone disagree with Policies, with Projects, with Programs that work for everyone, without discrimination, without exclusion, without distinction, leading us towards a Just, Prosperous Life?</p>

<p>How is it possible to disagree with the fact that in the next few days thousands of streets will start to be built all over the country, a multi-million investment in streets for the People...?</p>

<p>How is it possible to disagree with Highways, Roads, Health Centers, Hospitals, Clinics, for everyone, with Voluntary Vaccination for those who want it...?</p>

<p>How is it possible to disagree with the fact that we all figure as Protagonists, because we are Complementary, Fraternal Protagonists acting  in Solidarity, above all this Prosperity, this Progress, which are happening in spite of criminal terrorism and the brutal aggressions of Imperialism, because God is Great and because we can work in an enlightened way, using our Talent and our Intelligence to serve the People, which is to serve God.</p>

<p>We are living days that for us are days of Joy, because the greatest Joy and the greatest Satisfaction of ours is to serve, to serve others... That is how we grew up, cultivating a Vocation of Service... That is how we grew up, and that has been the undying and unchanging commitment of the Sandinista National Liberation Front: To serve our People, to contribute to a Model like the one we now have, where we all work for the Good of All. Without exclusions. Without discrimination.</p>

<p>We call upon ourselves...! A Model calling on us all, never arrogant, that is the one we have, and those are the Paths of Peace and Victories, that, with the strength of Love that Overcomes and Conquers, because once again and every day Love triumphs, thanks be to God, we move forward.</p>

<p>42/19, and we thank God for so much Life, and thank God for the Infinite Heroism of our People. That is why we say, all the Triumphs belong to the People, and always in these days, and every day, I send a special embrace to the Families that have lost spouses, children, siblings, relatives in general, who have offered their Lives so that we may have this Dignified, Free, Harmonious, Loving Nation, where we live together in Peace, where we continue to cultivate Reconciliation and Affection, and where we want to advance for the Good of All, and with All of us, Everyone Together.</p>

<p>Compañer@s, big embraces, Victorious Energies, Victorious Hopes... Tomorrow, there is much work ahead, we continue working to achieve all the new Victories we deserve, with Courage, with Conviction, with Heart, with Decisiveness.</p>

<p>Let's move forward, Compañer@s, always further on, always with Love, as it is our Future. Let us all congratulate ourselves, because we are indeed moving forward, and Peace reigns here. Thank you, Companions.</p>
