<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Good evening, families of this Christian, Socialist, Solidarity-inspired Nicaragua.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Today we are commemorating the 46th Anniversary of the Founding of the National Police, the People's Police, our Police who were organized serving as its first Members, Officers, Compañeras and Compañeros who came out of Revolutionary Combat, Comrades who came out of the Insurrectional Struggle.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Compañeros and Compañeras who already had combat experience in which they had forged themselves in the Struggle with great strength, and also with much grief when they came across peasant families, families of impoverished extraction, murdered by the enemies of the People, murdered by the Counterrevolutionaries. And naturally also the Compañeras and Compañeros Police officers who gave their lives to achieve Peace and Stability in Nicaragua.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">It was a heroic stage in which our Police were forged, as well as our Army; they were forged like steel when it is being made and, indeed, these are 46 years of struggle for Life, the Life of Nicaragua’s Families, for the Life and Security of Young People, Children, Adults, the Elderly.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">A permanent struggle where many policemen have been killed, not only by delinquents, by criminals, but also those who were killed in the 2018 uprising that tried to end our Revolution. But the Revolution was already in the Heart of the People, in the Consciousness of our People, in the combativeness of the People and, quite simply, all they did was to fill people with grief, affecting Peace, because they did affect Peace, since they affected daily business, because they blocked highways.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">And really, they thought that since they were not being cleared away, they thought the Revolution was already defeated. But simply put, they were not cleared away, because the People were becoming aware that those who wanted to put an end to the Revolution were in fact attacking Peace and bleeding the People themselves.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">They refused to accept ending the Roadblocks, and instead committed yet more crimes, against civilians and against the Police, against the Military; Compañeras and Compañeros who were just passing by and came to a roadblock where they were immediately captured, tortured, murdered and set alight.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Dozens of Compañeras and Compañeros were killed in this way, and that made it possible for the People to value Peace, because the People themselves began to demand, to insist that Peace be restored. And the time arrived when the Police, with the Volunteer Police and with the People, cleared the notorious roadblocks that were set up, they cleared those places where there was murder, looting and theft.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">It was a quick Operation in fact, there was no big battle, it wasn't a battle that lasted for many weeks... No! They simply moved the Police Forces to the points where there was most prevalence of crimes committed, and when those people felt the Force of the Police, the Force of our Volunteer Police, the Force of the People, advancing on them, they immediately started to flee and dissolve. And they were defeated, in a matter of seconds they were defeated, only then to complain, and to this day they keep complaining, because they were defeated when they wanted to keep upending Peace.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Now, the People value Peace more and more with each passing day. All the social and economic sectors of our country value Peace more, everyone values Peace, and it is now well understood that, if we want to end poverty, Peace is essential, so as to continue building Hospitals, continue building Schools, continue building Housing for Families who are still impoverished.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">That is our goal and we are committed, the Revolution is committed to all Nicaragua’s Families, to ensure for them Health, Education and Housing. And we are going to achieve that, because we are moving forward. And the day will come when there is no lack of decent Housing for any Nicaraguan Family, no lack of employment, no lack of agricultural activities, or activities for craft people, for market traders since all of this has been multiplying, has been growing, why? Because there is Peace. Peace has been fundamental, is fundamental, and will continue to be fundamental, for Nicaragua to become an increasingly prosperous and safer Country.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Peace!</span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Address by Daniel</span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">You see, here is Peace says this child. Yes! This Child will turn 2 years old this coming Saturday, but he has an attraction for these activities of the People, for revolutionary activities, for the activities of the Army and the Police. He's walking now, and waving.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">This Struggle that we are waging, Brothers and Sisters, saves Lives, and Childhood is what represents the Lives we have to protect the most, the Lives of Children, the Lives of Families; in protecting the Lives of Families we are protecting the Lives of Children, and protecting pregnant Mothers, during their pregnancy, as we are doing now with Programs in Hospitals, where we are making sure that pregnant Mothers can have a successful delivery.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">That is to say, what comes first is Life, the Lives of the Children who are in Pregnant Mothers comes first. And for this we have managed to develop techniques and capabilities, such that Mothers bearing their Child in the womb, via the follow-up they receive in Hospitals, it now possible to offer them a system of evaluation that if children appear with any problems in the womb, then an operate on them can be performed in the womb.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">And the Elderly who are in conditions of poverty or who have multiple diseases, we are also developing Programs for them, care homes, to attend them there and save Lives, so that they are not left stranded in the midst of misery, in the midst of poverty, but, in our People we have always had great respect, great affection for the Elderly, because we value that without them we would not be, and that they helped us to form, to grow.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">And we are making all this effort in order to advance as much as possible, since it is our duty to advance as much as possible, with all the means we have at our disposal, to bring more Health Posts to those places where there are still no Health Posts.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Although I would say that Health Posts now cover practically all of Nicaragua. Since, in addition, where there is no Health Post, a vehicle can arrive there with all the medical equipment and Specialists to do the examinations for the Communities, the Regions which do not have the opportunity to have a Hospital or a Health Post nearby.</span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">That is to say also, we have a free hospital service. Here it is forbidden to charge for health care, it is forbidden to charge for Education; Education and Health Care are free for the entire Nicaraguan people.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So much news, that we listen to or that we watch, about what the world is like right now. The world is not a World of Peace, unfortunately no it is not a World of Peace. When there should be Peace in the World is when there are more conflicts and more wars in the World; it is when terrible crimes are being committed, such as those committed by the government of Israel, which is murdering an entire people, destroying all their homes, all their buildings, every school and hospital, because it wants to disappear the Palestinian People.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And the Government of Israel is doing so because it has military resources, the billions that the US Government and European governments are putting there, in Israel, so that Israel can finish off the Palestinian People, and by finishing off the Palestinian People they can then become the owners of the entire region, and by becoming the owners of the entire region, which is a very rich region, then give that wealth to the Imperialist Countries.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">In other words, the United States does not make this investment for free, they simply make it because they are interested in dominating the economy of the entire Region, a Region which historically is a Region that has a great Identity, great Strength, and where there are Peoples who have been rebellious Peoples who have fought against colonialism but now they want to turn them into slaves.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Of course, we condemn the crimes being committed against the Palestinian People, as well as we condemn the deployment of military forces by the United States government here in the Latin American Region, with the tale that Venezuela is the greatest exporter of cocaine and that Colombia is the greatest producer of coca leaf. And on that pretext, inventing that the Venezuelan authorities, that the President of Venezuela, our Brother Nicolás Maduro is someone who presides over drug trafficking gangs.</span></span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="300" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/435850.jpeg" width="450" /></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Venezuela, a country with immense wealth, is the Country with the largest oil reserves in the world, and that's what the US rulers, US capital, are looking for, to take over Venezuelan oil, to steal the oil of the Venezuelan people, inventing that coca comes out of those Southern Countries and which is then consumed in the United States.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">They, who have such intelligence power, such gigantic military power, where is that power then? If they can't control their ports, if they can't control their cities, the United States of America is where the world’s greatest drug consumption takes place and where thousands and thousands of young Americans die as a result of drugs.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So, nor do they not want to assume the responsibility of controlling their Banks; since drug traffickers stealthily open accounts in the Banks, and there is no law there that requires strict checking of those accounts. In other words, there is complicity there.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">It is terrible what is happening, given, on the one hand, what they have done to immigrants, even Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters, who have traveled to the United States believing that they will be much better off than here, they are now sending them back to Nicaragua.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">But first they imprison them there in the United States, and they have imprisoned entire families there in the United States; entire families from Latin American, from Caribbean Countries and other Regions of the World, who came to the United States there when the US authorities themselves were asking for emigrants to work in agriculture, work in industrial areas, because labor was needed. Now it turns out that they are being expelled from the United States; they are putting them in prison, accusing them of drug trafficking and sending them to prison.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And in the case of Nicaragua, they are deporting people, flights are arriving here and they are received here, since they left with the intentions of working and they were working.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This is what is happening in the United States: Those who are pursue emigrants to capture them and deport them arrive at the factories, when the factories are working, at any time of the day or night they enter and begin to detain the workers, because most of the workers are immigrants. And this clearly causes discomfort for the owners of companies that are American.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">That is to say, it is a totally brutal policy, because they are attacking citizens who entered there; others even with American citizenship, they also go to prison, and then outside, another number of people have died, murdered there in the United States.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The emigrants who return on the flights we welcome very well, these days a flight with 119 emigrants arrived. These are Nicaraguans, workers, humble people who were struggling there, and well, we welcome them here with open arms.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">We received them as Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters, because they did not go there to ask the United States to invade Nicaragua, they went there to look for Life, and look at the tragic outcome. And though more flights may come, the good thing is that many opportunities are opening up here, more job opportunities opening up every day and so they will have the opportunity to work alongside their Families.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">On this day, our congratulations first of all to your Families, Brother and Sister Police Officers, because there can be no Police Officers if their Families are not there first, and your Families accompany you, the Families who understand your work is a risk, a great danger, because you risk your life through your work.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And your families know they may not be seeing you every day, since your job is not an eight-hour-a-day job, but it's a job around the clock, and one that has many risks, and your Family there, really gives you their support. So our thanks, our recognition to the Families of all the Police Officers of our National Police.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And how glad we are about the recognition, among the promotions, to see a good contingent of Women there receiving Ranks that they well deserve. And our congratulations also to their male Comrades who have also received Higher Ranks.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Our recognition also to First Commissioner General Francisco Díaz as the Founding Leader of the National Police, and to Commissioner General Victoriano, the Compañero who today shares that Post with General Francisco Díaz.</span></span></p>

<p class="western" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:115%"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Well, tomorrow we will have the Parade on the Avenue Bolívar to Chávez, we will be there accompanying you in the Parade, and transmitting the Parade as we are transmitting this Event, for all of Nicaragua, for all Nicaragua’s Families.</span></span></p>
