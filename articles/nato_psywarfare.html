      <br>
North American and European media coverage of Nicaragua in recent years
has followed the same template applied to other countries targeted by
the US government and their NATO allies. The modus operandi is always
the same : military encirclement, diplomatic isolation, media
demonization, funding of local proxies and violent provocation. If that
mixture fails to bring about regime change, the US government and its
NATO and regional allies then apply economic sanctions and, where
necessary, armed aggression. <br>
      <br>
Over the years, Nicaragua has been subject to coverage by media from
across the whole gamut of&nbsp; NATO country psy-warfare assets. The
latest adjunct to NATO's darkness-visible psy-warfare offensive against
Nicaragua is Tom Hennigan's article &#8220;After the revolution&#8221; in the Irish
Times. Hennigan's article is almost 100% fact-free NATO psy-warfare. It
reaffirms the main NATO psy-warfare lie on Nicaragua &#8211; that President
Daniel Ortega is a corrupt, repressive tyrant.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's general elections will be held on November 6th this year.
Hennigan's version of NATO's regime change media template for Nicaragua
confirms the main themes that will be used with increasing vehemence as
the election campaign proceeds &#8211; bogus claims of electoral fraud and
unconstitutional illegality. Those fake themes apart, omission too is a
vital component of the regime-change psy-warfare NATO country media
machine. <br>
      <br>
Omission is NATO's gagged phantom hostage, held forever in a kind of
media Guantanamo Bay Block Alpha for especially troublesome prisoners.
On Nicaragua, a media-water-boarded Omission emits muffled lacunae
signalling two information vacuums diligently maintained by NATO's
psy-warfare&nbsp; propagandists. The first excludes facts exposing the
Nicaraguan opposition's dishonesty and deceit. The second negates the
incredible success of President Ortega's Sandinista led government just
four and a half years after taking office.<br>
      <br>
That second vacuum hermetically seals out extremely positive appraisals
by numerous UN and other multilateral institutions. Along with many
other organizations, UNICEF, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization,
the Panamerican Health Organization, the InterAmerican Development Bank
and the International Monetary Fund have all publicly praised the
Nicaraguan government. Key motifs in their appraisals have been
competence and probity.<br>
      <br>
Likewise, NATO's psy-warfare media assets never offer rational analysis
of why opinion polls show President Ortega currently has around 50%
popular support nationally, more than twice that of his nearest rival.
They avoid reporting that the economy grew by almost 6% from 2009 to
2010, a fact confirmed by the IMF. Foreign investment and exports are
at record levels. Despite the setbacks of the international economic
crisis, health and education indicators show steady improvements.
Extreme poverty has been cut by more than 7%.<br>
      <br>
At the same time the NATO psy-warfare crew suppress the unquestionable
success of President Ortega's government, they also suppress the deceit
and dishonesty of the NATO country supported opposition. NATO's
psy-warfare propaganda template projects ex-Sandinistas like Dora Maria
Tellez and Carlos Fernando Chamorro as heroic independent-minded
democrats full of integrity. But the record shows otherwise.<br>
      <br>
Tellez fooled international progressive supporters in 2008 by
portraying a phoney protest she staged against the electoral authority
as a principled stand for freedom. In fact, her protest was a
smokescreen to cover up a grubby political agreement with the country's
corrupt right wing. Soon after her theatrical protest, Tellez and her
cronies urged their supporters to vote for Eduardo Montealegre who had
cut a deal with Arnoldo Aleman to be the PLC's candidate for mayor of
Managua.<br>
      <br>
Eduardo Montealegre has hidden behind his parliamentary immunity for
years so as to avoid a standing indictment on charges of multi-million
dollar corruption while a government minister. The charges are based on
an investigation by Nicaragua's independent State audit body. Since the
municipal election campaign in 2008, Tellez and Montealegre have
rejected Aleman's PLC and are working together with extreme right wing
presidential candidate Fabio Gadea.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Despite this clear record of hypocritical opportunism, NATO psy-warfare
disinformation assets invariably present Tellez as the perfect paradigm
of political integrity. For his part, Carlos Fernando Chamorro has
shown himself to be a cynical self-promoting opportunist. He was caught
in 2008 prior to the municipal elections using his CINCO
non-governmental organization to channel development cooperation funds
under the table to fund activists in Tellez's Sandinista Renewal
Movement (MRS) political alliance. <br>
      <br>
Far from being an independent journalist Chamorro and his family have
accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from USAID and European Union
sources. The money is channelled through initiatives like
Camtransparencia run by international corporate mercenary multinational
Dyncorp and Programa Vida en Democracia, run by another of the
oligarchic Chamorro family's own non-profits. Anxious to support the
psy-warfare offensive against President Daniel Ortega, foreign donor
institutions turn a blind eye to the Chamorro's family's incestuous use
of their money.<br>
      <br>
Downright falsehoods<br>
      <br>
The irredeemable cynicism of the NATO country psy-warfare media is
self-evident from their&nbsp; downright falsehoods. In April this year,
Tim Rogers filed a report entitled &#8220;Eyeing Middle East Nicaragua's
Ortega quashes weekend protests&#8221; in which he falsely claimed that a
tiny opposition march on April 2nd was &#8220;blocked&#8221; from marching. The
opposition supporters were not impeded in any way from marching along
the route assigned to them by the authorities. They simply refused to
follow that route.<br>
      <br>
Having refused to comply with their assigned route, the opposition then
viciously attacked a cordon of defenceless policewomen that separated
them from a much larger demonstration by peaceful Sandinista
demonstrators. In the end 18 police officers had to be taken to
hospital and kept in overnight for treatment, several with very serious
injuries. Aware of the deliberate nature of that violent provocation,
the police showed extraordinary restraint. No opposition demonstrators
were arrested or injured. <br>
      <br>
Tim Rogers deliberately failed to report these facts which render his
article's tendentious, dishonest headline completely ridiculous. NATO
country psy-warfare writers like Rogers and Hennigan effortlessly spew
out such articles based entirely on falsehood and omission. For anyone
interested, a few random examples from Hennigan's &#8220;After the
Revolution&#8221; piece are analyzed at the end of this article. Far more
interesting than Rogers and Hennigan's dishonesty is the overall
developing message of NATO's psy-warfare media assets prior to
Nicaragua's general elections in November this year.<br>
      <br>
De-legitimizing sovereignty<br>
      <br>
A primary theme of the NATO country psy-warfare phoney-reporters is the
alleged electoral fraud in the municipal elections of 2008 in which the
FSLN increased the number of municipalities they governed from 93 to
104. Opinion polls had predicted that kind of result. The glib NATO
psy-warfare claims of alleged fraud have never been supported by
credible factual documentation. <br>
      <br>
Nor is the monitoring presence in those elections ever acknowledged of
international election specialists from organizations throughout Latin
America and the Caribbean. The NATO country psy-warfare correspondents
invariably cite USAID funded election-disinformation body Etica y
Transparencia as a source. Etica y Transparencia has a link to their
report on the 2008 municipal elections on their web site. <br>
      <br>
But the link is empty and has been for months. So it has been
impossible to check the incessant claims of fraud against freely
available supporting evidence. That has not stopped NATO country&nbsp;
psy-warfare troupers unscrupulously citing Etica y Transparencia as if
it were independent or authoritative, which it is not. The repeated
insistence on electoral fraud in 2008 lacks credible supporting
evidence, apart from self-interested claims by the Nicaraguan
opposition.<br>
      <br>
NATO psy-warfare accounts of the aftermath of those municipal elections
always suppress the fact that Eduardo Montealegre incited the street
violence in which, in one incident, a Sandinista journalist was
attacked by opposition supporters, stabbed repeatedly and thrown into
his vehicle after it had been set on fire. The NATO country media
always talk about Sandinista &#8220;mobs&#8221; while persistently under-reporting
repeated opposition violence. Nor do they ever acknowledge the
determined efforts of the Nicaraguan police to maintain order with a
minimum use of force.<br>
      <br>
Likewise Nicaraguan opposition claims of constitutional illegality
blithely ignore the categorical authority of the country's Supreme
Court. They also omit clear precedents set very recently in Costa Rica
and Colombia, where international NATO psy-warfare media assets quietly
accepted the re-election of Oscar Arias and Alvaro Uribe. These themes
of electoral fraud and constitutional illegality have a simple
propaganda objective. Regime change requires the target government to
be smeared as illegitimate. <br>
      <br>
One way of doing that is for minority opposition groups to stage
violent provocations &#8211; like the one falsely reported by Tim Rogers &#8211; so
as to elicit a repressive response from the authorities, as has
happened in Libya and Syria. The NATO psy-warfare media then grossly
exaggerate and distort the consequent repression so as to justify NATO
country or UN intervention. Another way to fabricate illegitimacy is to
provoke a constitutional crisis by causing electoral chaos, as Alassane
Outtara's bloodthirsty, UN-supported opposition did in the Ivory Coast
prior to being installed in power via military intervention by France
and the UN. <br>
      <br>
The Nicaraguan opposition almost achieved that second option in early
2010. They have a nominal majority in the National Assembly and
deliberately forced a constitutional crisis by refusing to elect new
authorities for the Supreme Electoral Council and the Supreme Court.
That proto-coup by opposition legislators was thwarted by a decisive
Presidential decree confirming existing officials in their posts until
such time as the National Assembly should meet its constitutional
obligation to approve and elect new candidates. The decree was based on
a never-revoked constitutional clause applied during the handover of
power in 1990.<br>
      <br>
Tell-tale signs of regime change prepping<br>
      <br>
It is in this context that NATO country-funded Nicaraguan NGO
representatives are now lobbying in Washington for US congressional
support in their efforts to de-legitimize decisions by Nicaragua's
legitimately elected government and its Supreme Court.&nbsp;
NATO-country psy-warfare&nbsp; propaganda bears out the hypothesis of
heightened preparation for attempts at regime-change. The psy-warfare
offensive relies on false accusations and provocations by minority
political forces and unrepresentative cliques to keep the international
media cloak over their own political failure and endless deceit. <br>
      <br>
That has been the pattern used to destabilize Libya and Syria and is
the pattern used by NATO country psy-warfare media in Latin America
too. In Nicaragua, the MRS - whose vociferous representatives are
constantly quoted in the NATO country psy-warfare propaganda offensive
- consistently registered levels of national support at around just 1%
all through 2010 and to date. Now that same unrepresentative group of
individuals are piggybacking their way to lucrative positions in the
National Assembly via an alliance with a group of right wing movements
that enjoy far more electoral support. <br>
      <br>
These unrepresentative individuals are the counterparts of the
anti-democratic cliques and minorities supported by NATO countries
around the world in their efforts to destabilize target governments. If
one pays attention to NATO country psy-warfare reports on Nicaragua, a
constant feature is a quote by some opposition figure or other
advocating violence. Both Hennigan and Rogers use this trope as part of
their psy-warfare armoury. It is a regular feature of reports by all
the other NATO country psy-warfare media outlets and of the infinite
disinformation feedback loop linking those international media to local
Nicaraguan media.<br>
      <br>
Hennigan quotes Dora Maria Tellez saying, &#8220;In Nicaragua, every time you
close the door on a civic resolution to political conflict, the door
that opens leads to war. This is a reality.&#8221; For his part, Rogers has a
quote from another ex-Sandinista Moises Hassan, &#8220;Hassan says if the
opposition&#8217;s initial effort to prevent 'Ortega&#8217;s illegal candidacy'
fails to keep the president from remaining in power beyond 2011, there
will come a 'second struggle to remove him from a false presidency.' &#8221;<br>
      <br>
The psychopathic NATO modus operandi is the same in Latin America as it
is in North Africa and the Middle East. The patterns are blatantly
obvious and the techniques monotonously repetitive in Big Brother
totalitarian style. All the signs are that despite the NATO country
backed hate campaign, President Daniel Ortega will be re-elected in
November 2011 with a much increased majority and quite possibly a
working majority in the National Assembly. At that point, the countdown
to regime change may well begin in earnest. That will be clear if and
when the NATO psy-warfare media slip into frenetic overdrive as they
did in their coverage of Libya.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Note<br>
      <br>
A few random falsehoods from Tom Hennigan's article &#8220;After the
Revolution&#8221; :<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Hennigan: &#8220;Nicaragua is no nearer to escaping its ranking as the
western hemisphere&#8217;s poorest nation after Haiti.&#8221; <br>
Fact : Nicaragua enjoys record exports and foreign investment levels.
It is likely to be completely self-sufficient in food production by
2013 and 80% energy self-sufficient by 2017. The country is likely to
be classified as a medium-income country within five years. Even
opposition parties have had to accept an independent report confirming
that extreme poverty in Nicaragua has been cut since 2005 from over 17%
to just over 9%.<br>
      <br>
Hennigan : &#8220;Overseeing the November ballot will be the same Supreme
Electoral Council that rubberstamped the fraud of 2008. At its head is
Ortega ally Roberto Rivas. He is threatening to exclude foreign
observers from the poll, saying they are unneeded in a democracy such
as Nicaragua.&#8221;<br>
Fact : The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) has been virtually unchanged
since before 2001. This CSE oversaw numerous national, regional and
local elections in Nicaragua with no claims of fraud prior to the
municipal elections of 2008 and has always rejected the unsupported
claims of fraud in those elections made by the losers in the hopelessly
divided Nicaraguan opposition. Rivas has made clear that foreign
delegations can be invited to the elections in 2011 once the CSE
publishes in August the regulations that will apply to such visiting
delegations. Foreign delegations are invited not by the CSE but by the
government. See, http://tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/8241<br>
      <br>
Hennigan : &#8220;But in 2009, a Supreme Court stacked with loyalists, as a
result of Ortega&#8217;s pact with the Liberal leader Alem&aacute;n, simply
invalidated these constitutional breaks. It ruled they infringed
Ortega&#8217;s human rights in a decision local jurists said went against all
legal precedent and logic.&#8221;<br>
Fact: In 2010, Nicaragua's Supreme Court in plenary session with both
Sandinista and opposition magistrates ratified a ruling to allow both
the President and mayors in Nicaragua to be re-elected. The ruling
follows various precedents in recent years in Latin America including
very similar rulings by the Supreme Courts of Costa Rica and Colombia
in favour of Oscar Arias and Alvaro Uribe respectively.<br>
      <br>
Hennigan: &#8220;To cement his entente with the Catholic hierarchy ahead of
the 2006 election, Ortega ordered Sandinistas in the National Assembly
to abandon long-standing policy and vote in support of a law banning
abortion in all circumstances.&#8221;<br>
Fact : That vote in the National Assembly followed shortly after a huge
demonstration of an estimated 200,000 people organized by the Roman
Catholic Church in Nicaragua in favour of changing the law on abortion
-&nbsp; a measure put before the legislature by the government of
President Enrique Bola&ntilde;os. The vote was a free vote. Of the 37
FSLN deputies, 26 voted to change the law, the others abstained or did
not participate in the vote. The measure was passed by a large majority
including politicians with whom those protesting that vote &#8211; like Sofia
Montenegro of the Autonomous Women's Movement - are now effectively
allied for the 2011 elections. Subsequently, the Nicaraguan Health
Ministry has implemented administrative measures to protect the lives
of mothers in danger from high risk pregnancy and to remove any fear of
prosecution on the part of doctors.<br>
      <br>
Hennigan remarks in passing on so many issues in Nicaragua &#8211; for
example Venezuelan development cooperation via ALBA, the role of
Rosario Murillo, or the Narvaez-Ortega controversy &#8211; that only a very
extensive rebuttal would serve to expose all the sly inaccuracies he
deploys. <br>
      <br>
In mentioning the accusations of sexual abuse against Ortega, Hennigan
himself abuses the request made by Zoilamerica Narvaez in a press
conference in 2010 for media not to exploit the controversy for
political purposes. After many years of anguish for all concerned, the
family seem to have reconciled. Hennigan compounds his caricature of
that controversy with a crude misogynist attack on Rosario Murillo,
whose strategic acumen has played a leading role in the Nicaraguan
government's extraordinarily successful implementation of its programme.<br>
      <br>
On the false claims made by NATO country psy-warfare media assets like
Hennigan about Nicaragua and ALBA see, <br>
      <br>
http://tortillaconsal.com/prospero.html<br>
http://tortillaconsal.com/ingles_albacaruna.html<br>
      <br>
The fundamental hypocrisy about ALBA is that the NATO psy-warfare media
never question the handover of hundreds of millions of dollars every
year with no oversight worth the name to their allies in Nicaragua's
non-governmental sector which for&nbsp; years now has been the main
political opposition in Nicaragua, funded by foreign taxpayers money
for over 20 years with little obvious benefit to Nicaragua's
impoverished majority. <br>
      <br>
On the other hand Venezuelan development cooperation through private
sector companies has been demonized despite the extensive self-evident
benefits enjoyed by the most impoverished sectors of Nicaraguan society
including a sharp drop in levels of extreme poverty directly
attributable to ALBA investments in agricultural production and
low-interest micro-credit.<br>
