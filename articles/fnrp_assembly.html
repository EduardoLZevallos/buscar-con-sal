In Honduras, there seems little chance of a short term solution to the
continuing stalemate between Porfirio Lobo's de facto regime and the
National Popular Resistance Front (FNRP).&nbsp; Both sides face
intractable
diffciulties. For Porfirio Lobo, the insuperable hurdle seems to be
international acceptance by a majority of countries in Latin America
and the Caribbean permitting his government to return to the
Organization of American States. For the FNRP, heading towards a
national assembly on February 26th this year, agreement over a unified
strategy between its diverse components continues to seem out of reach.<br>
      <br>
The FNRP is made of progressive trades unions, mainstream political
currents, organizations of rural workers and indigenous peoples,
women's and students organizations and a plethora of smaller groups
covering almost every sector of Honduran national life. That very
diversity gives the FNRP great credibility and authority but also makes
coherent strategic planning extremely difficult. Each component sector
has its own point of view and agenda.<br>
      <br>
One gauge of the distance the FNRP has to travel to guarantee its
viability is that to date it seems to have no solid economic base. When
component organizations travel overseas to rally support, they do so in
their own name&nbsp; rather than in the name of the FNRP. It seems the
FNRP
has no program of membership subscription either for individuals or for
organizations. Funding seems to be erratic with no overall fundraising
strategy or mechanisms in place.<br>
      <br>
If the economic viability of the FNRP is vital, the means by which it
elaborates and extends its support is also crucial to its future. The
ALBA governments that have given essential support to former President
Jos&eacute; Manuel Zelaya have been unable so far to organize&nbsp;
support for the
FNRP's grass roots base in more participatory and&nbsp; practical ways.
For
example, an ALBA credit mechanism for cooperatives and small and medium
sized businesses would give much needed help to sustain grass roots
support for the FNRP. Likewise, developing regional and national
commercial networks specifically to assist economic activity by
supporters of the FNRP&nbsp; would be of much practical help to many
sectors
of opposition to the Porfirio Lobo regime.<br>
      <br>
The economic aspect of the FNRP's development seems to have been
relegated below political priorities and arguments turning around
different possible strategies. The main options under debate seem to be
an electoral path or the calling of an autonomous constituent assembly.
Arguments in favour&nbsp; of mass insurrection are generally dismissed
as
wholly unrealistic given the absence of&nbsp; truly overwhelming
popular
support (in Nicaragua the mass insurrection against Somoza took around
80%)&nbsp; and the lack of a military structure necessary for such a
strategy to succeed.<br>
      <br>
The balance of opinion in the FNRP favours an electoral strategy as an
essential step to define both&nbsp; levels of support and to prove or
disprove the viability and validity of an electoral path under the
repressive Lobo regime. Those calling for an autonomous constituent
assembly - mainly the COPINH and OFRANEH indigenous and gar&iacute;funa
people's organizations - seem unclear whether that assembly might be
primarily an event or a longer term process. Critics of the idea argue
that it would require a parallel constitutional system, perhaps some
kind of liberated territory and some consensus about what authority
such an assembly might have.<br>
      <br>
An electoral strategy faces less formidable but still daunting
problems. The FNRP leadership seem to agree that it makes no sense for
the Frente itself to act as an electoral vehicle but rather as the base
organization for a separate electoral front. Between now and 2013 the
FNRP will have to organize that electoral machine&nbsp; which will
involve a
systematic programme of mass education and a strategy for the practical
logistics of electoral mobilization.&nbsp; In addition, the Frente will
need
to work out its electoral agenda on issues like human rights, natural
resources and land reform, among many others.<br>
      <br>
Repeated murders of campesinos and activists in the Bajo Aguan&nbsp;
and
elsewhere in the country are only the most dramatic and publicised of
the wholesale human rights abuses and repression applied by Porfirio
Lobo's regime and the sinister Honduran oligarchs who are the real
power behind it. Faced with that relentless assault, it is an open
question whether the FNRPs' urgent strategic debate can reach a
successful resolution at the national assembly on February 26th without
opening up damaging ideological divisions. At stake is the chance of
any serious democratic change in Honduras to change the country's long
history of poverty and injustice.<br>
      <br>
Regionally, the continuing anomaly represented by the illegitimate
regime of Porfirio Lobo symbolizes the irretrievable breakdown in trust
between most of Latin America and the United States. Former President
Manuel Zelaya's government had embarked on a genuinely redistributive
social and economic programme in favour of the impoverished majority in
Honduras. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have
tried to impose acceptance of the Lobo regime against a continent wide
recognition that reducing inequality is a prerequisite to reducing
poverty and promoting prosperity. The coup in Honduras and its
successor regime under Porfirio Lobo have demonstrated that the US
government and its local allies will go to any lengths to resist that
fundamental reality. <br>
