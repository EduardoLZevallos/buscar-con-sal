<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">"Convinced
that the family is the heart of our sovereign
land," reads the introduction of the <a href="http://74.125.45.104/search?q=cache:nvHDV4eNy3QJ:www.conamornicaragua.org.ni/DOCUMENTOS%25202008/SEPTIEMBRE/PROGRAMA%2520AMOR%2520190908.doc+programa+amor&amp;hl=es&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;gl=ni">program's plan</a> presented by the
government, "the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity is
committed ... to consolidating the moral and spiritual values that
society needs to grow in humanity. "Programa Amor is part of the
government's commitment to promote and defend children's and young
people's rights to free education, health care, security, sport,
culture, recreation and happiness. ... [The program] aims to restore
the right to a happy and dignified children."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
plan identifies the programs five fundamental
objectives;&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<ol style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>To restore children's right to grow up in normal
conditions without
being exposed to risks associated with living and/or working on the
street;</li>
<li>To restore children's right to be loved and cared for
by a
family;</li>
<li>To create and rehabilitate Child Development Centers
(professional créches) to provide day care for the children of working
mothers;</li>
<li>To restore children's right to be registered in the
civil
register;</li>
<li>To ensure the right to specialized attention for
children
and young people with disabilities.</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">The right to
grow up in normal conditions without being exposed to
risks associated with life on the streets</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">After
carrying out a six month pilot program of social work
with street children, the government estimates that there are
approximately 25,000 children and adolescents living and working on the
streets in Nicaragua. Based on the progress made during the six month
pilot program Marcía Ramírez, Coordinator of "Programa Amor," believes
the objective to reintegrate those 25,000 children into society by the
end of 2011 to be realistic.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">One hundred
social workers will be involved in this part of
the project and will be responsible for accompanying the children and
young people at school, at home and in the community ensuring
sufficient support is available to keep the children in school. The
social workers will also be responsible for helping the families of the
street kids create a steady source of income with the provision of
accessible credits. Currently social workers are working in this way
with 4,000 street kids in Managua and plan to extend the program to
include Granada, Estelí, Jinotega and Matagalpa at the beginning of
2009. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">The
right to be loved and cared for by a family</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Currently in
Nicaragua there are 2,967 children in Centers of
Special Protection (children's homes). According to the government, 80%
of these children are there simply as a result of the situation of
extreme poverty faced by their families. Marcía Ramírez, believes that
the right to be brought up within a loving family is a fundamental
human right and that "poverty should not be a criteria" on which to
base the decision to put a child in a home. "Programa Amor" therefore
aims to work towards the possibility of returning all 2,374 children in
children's homes for reasons of poverty to their original family homes.
Social workers will work with the families and the children prior to
this move and the program will provide support including free
professional daycare to help parents to deal with their situation and
care for their children. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">"Programa
Amor" is also working towards consolidating a
network of over 700 foster and adoptive families where children who are
unable to return to their biological families can be placed. Also as
part of the program two specialized Children Protection Centers in
Managua will be rehabilitated. According to Ramírez, however, these
homes will be used only as a last resort and children will be placed
there for the shortest period of time possible. Ramírez has faith that
Nicaraguan society will prove itself able to provide loving homes for
the children currently in care given the example of the 50,000 war
orphans that Nicaraguan families welcomed into their homes during the
1980s. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Government
funded créches for the children of working mothers</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">During its
first 20 months of government, the Ortega
administration has built or rehabilitated 22 Children Development
Centers (professional créches) in towns and cities across the country,
and is in the process of building or rehabilitating 18 more. The aim is
to have 100 such centers with a total capacity to care for 10,000
children up and running by the end of 2011. These centers provide
professional childcare free of charge for the children of working
mothers in impoverished neighborhoods. Hundreds of similar community
run créches are being set up and maintained with government funds in
rural areas. The founding of hundreds of government funded créches,
known as CDIs, during the 1980s is one of the most memorable benefits
the first FSLN government provided for many impoverished families. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">The
right to an identity </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
government estimates that at least 50,000 children in
Nicaragua do not have birth certificates. In order to restore
children's right to be registered in the civil registry the Ministry of
Health (MINSA) is working towards the installation of civil
registration facilities in all hospitals and health centers where
births are attended. In coordination with the Councils of Citizen Power
(CPCs) the Ministry of the Family (MIFAMILIA) will arrange house to
house visits in communities across the country to locate and those
families who have been unable to register their children and to
facilitate registration. The Ministry of Education (MED) will be
responsible for ensuring that all children in primary school have birth
certificates.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">The right to
specialized attention for children with
disabilities</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In order to
provide specialized attention for children and
young people with disabilities "Programa Amor" aims to built and equip
20 specialized centers in hospitals around the country. In an attempt
to reduce the number of children born with disabilities, MINSA will
incorporate educational content about how to avoid certain disabilities
in unborn children into its pregnancy support program. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The program's
plan is undeniably extremely ambitious, but
Coordinator Marcía Ramírez, a social worker specializing in family
therapy and social psychology, believes its objectives are not
unrealistic. In <a href="http://www.multinoticias.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1468&amp;Itemid=18">an interview</a> published in the weekly newspaper El 19 on
October 2, Ramírez, talks at length about why she believes the program
will achieve those objectives. Below is a translation of extracts from
this interview.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> You
[helped to coordinate] one of the most successful
programs of the Revolution, [which aimed to] guarantee children's basic
rights. How do you feel about your mission in these new times?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> It is a much greater challenge because the
problems facing our children and teenagers have become so much more
complicated. During the last decade and a half Nicaraguan families have
faced unemployment, the deterioration of basic services, migration,
etc. All of this has an impact on a family's quality of life and on the
relationships within that family and results in a high proportion of
children unable to attend school, high levels of violence, abuse, drug
addiction and alcoholism, gangs, among other things.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> What's
the overall focus of the program. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> It is based on a broad strategy aiming to
prevent situations that result in the violation of children's rights.
The program takes into account all ages and all the situations of
potential risk: children of working mothers aged 0 - 6 in the country
and in the town, street kids, those deprived of the love and care of a
family, those who have some kind of disability and those who are not
registered in the civil register. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The program
constitutes an integrated policy of care for
children and teenagers based on the articulation of efforts by
different state institutions, specialized national organizations and
international cooperation agencies willing to establish alliances in
order to work towards restoring basic rights. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The central
element of the program is the recuperation of the
right to education. In this sense, the program constitutes a real and
effective strategy for poverty reduction which, combined with measures
which allow parents to create sources of income, will permit effective
results in the short and medium term. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> What
do you think about the integration between the
government and the CPCs and the participation of families and
communities in this struggle to reduce the levels of poverty suffered
by children?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> I think it represents the only possible way
to transcend welfarism and achieve sustainable results. The type of
sustainability I am talking about is not necessarily financial, but
more to do with the transformation of society's attitudes so that we
come to consider the fulfillment of children's basic rights as a
responsibility shared by families, communities, educational
institutions, central government and local governments. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> You
were responsible for one of the most successful
programs in terms of the restoration of children and teenagers' rights
in the first Sandinista government. How would you describe that
experience? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> It represented a wonderful opportunity to
dream, and to convert those dreams into reality. We conceived an idea,
a proposal for care and attention, with the certainty that we could
count on the full support of the government to make it happen. That
certainty motivated our workers to make a commitment to the program
which guaranteed high quality care and attention. We created a network
of day care services across literally the whole country, starting from
zero, which was where we found ourselves in 1979. We created access to
day care for 37,000 children in the countryside and in the towns. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> What
was the most positive experience of the
psychosocial work you participated in during the ten years of the first
revolutionary government? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> The experience with foster and adoptive
homes. The network of foster homes was the initiative of a comrade
called Gealili Giacoman, who directed the Rolando Carazo Center where
we cared for children under the age of six who had been abandoned or
orphaned. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Together with
a priest from Rama, Gealile started to place
some of the children with campesino families. I remember that she used
to come back from the follow up visits visibly excited by how naturally
the family took in the child, and how in such a short space of time
children were able to overcome the psycological problems that
inevitably haunt children in institutionalized homes. That is how the
network of foster homes started growing across the country and is still
active today with about 300 members. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">I think that
was the most wonderful part because it made is
possible to rescue one of the values most deeply rooted within
Nicaraguan families: the ability to open their homes to welcome a new
member as if he were a biological son. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Along the
same lines, the adoptions were another very
satisfying experience. The best evidence of the fact that it is our
duty to establish work methods capable of guaranteeing that all
children have the right to grow up within a loving family, is to meet
with some of the children who were adopted during that period, who
today are professional adults and responsible parents. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> And
what was the most difficult? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> My work with war victims. It was very painful
to work with a young person condemned to the rest of his life in a
wheel chair because of a bullet wound in his spine, and to watch him
being consumed by depression, without being able to do much to
alleviate his suffering. Although, with time, we did achieve a lot with
them, in training programs and workplace reintegration programs. But it
was difficult. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> How
will you apply your immense experience to
"Programa Amor"? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> With what I consider to be the key to
effectiveness within social work: to start from the people you are
working with, their culture, their vision of the world, their knowledge
and their skills, within a framework of respect and the fundamental aim
of positive results. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The starting
point, in this sense, is the teams of social
workers. At every level, the program's workers and their clients will
have the possibility to make proposals and to collaborate. The
program's strategy will be a collective construction, adapted and
improved everyday with participative mechanisms.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> How do
you plan to carry out this very sensitive work
in a world and in a society so different [to that of the 1980s] where
we
need to rebuild values, specifically to raise awareness about rights,
and the need for humanity and solidarity ... ? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> Like I said, the focus of the program is
preventative, which implies extensive work on the appreciation of
values throughout the education system, from the earliest age. This
work should be accompanied with creative processes of popular education
using all available spaces to promote relationships of respect and
equality within the family, methods of bringing up children without
violence, and responsible parenthood, among other things. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We have to
convert the country into one big school for the
formation of values so as to recuperate our cultural essence as a
people of great solidarity with a tradition of care and respect for its
elderly, a people that was capable of taking into its homes the 50,000
orphans from the war of liberation. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> [The
FSLN government] believes that children deserve,
that they have the right, to live with the love of a family. How did we
make that happen [in the 1980s]? And how will we be doing that today? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> In the 1980s we worked with the philosophy
that even the most luxurious children's home is not capable of
substituting the love of a family, even if that family is impoverished.
We promoted a broad network of day care services but only used two
children's homes where children spent the least possible time until we
found an alternative. As part of that approach we facilitated the
adoption process and were very flexible in the placement of children
with the adoptive families we had judged suitable until the
administrative procedures of the adoption had been completed. That made
it possible for many abandoned children to avoid spending any time in a
children's home. This sort of adoption resulted in the most
affectionate relationships between the adopted child and his new
family. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> Why do
you believe that so many children's home exist
today in Nicaragua? When and for what purposes are they valid? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> During the 16 years [of neo liberal
government] groups of kind hearted people, faced with the absence of
government policies, tried to provide an answer to the evident needs of
vulnerable children. In a country without child protection policies or
regulatory systems [of child protection] it is logical that [so many
children's home should have been set up].</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">A specialized
approach is required in dealing with children
living in children's homes because [the experience] affects the very
foundations of their personalities; their identity and the feeling of
belonging linked to the need to receive affection, something which is
just as important as receiving food. It is precisely in this regard, in
the fulfillment of a child's need for affection, where children's homes
present their principal limitation. It is a complex and difficult task
to fulfill the personal needs of a growing child in an institution
where dozens of other children and young people reside. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">However,
there will always be children who for diverse
reasons cannot be brought up by their own family. And there will be
situations when it is necessary to place children in a home for a short
period before placing them with a family, either within their own
extended family or with a foster or adoptive family. But to allow a
child to reach adulthood without a family to call his own is to deny
him a fundamental human right. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Poverty
should not be a criterion on which to base the decision
to put a child in a home. Children living in extreme poverty should be
attended in day care. "Programa Amor" works along the lines of this
philosophy.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> After
returning 80% of the children currently in
children homes, the ones who have been placed there for reasons of
extreme poverty, how do you envisage the work of the existing
children's homes?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> I envisage work being done in alliances. A
process of putting all our different experiences together. Together and
committed to fulfilling the rights of our children we will be able to
invest resources and combine efforts so as to create a model designed
to meet children's personal needs. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We are going
to meet the objective of zero children on the
streets by 2011. We did it under extremely complicated circumstances
[in the 1980s], and I think that today we can and should do it better
today. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> How
are you personally, and your team of social
workers going to work towards achieving this objective? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> With the implementation of a process based on
participative and efficient planning where every action is carried out
with a view to achieving an intermediate goal until reaching the final
objective of a healthy, happy child who is doing well at
school.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">To achieve
this implies working directly with the child in
psycho-pedagogic, cultural and recreational activities, supporting his
family so they are able to reinsert themselves into some kind of
economic activity, and working with the educative system to procuring
the use of teaching methods which take into account the affect living
on the streets has had on these children. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Social
workers will take on the responsibility of
identifying, accompanying and providing support for individual children
and their families and will work with staff at the school the child
goes to and with other existing social networks in order to create a
network of support to keep the child in school. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">El 19:</span> As a
specialist in social psychology, how do you think
that we can work together to build better relationships within
Nicaraguan families and within our society in general? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marcía
Ramírez:</span> We need to recuperate and/or develop the
ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes and accept that person
as he is, his ways of thinking and feeling. I think that would be the
starting point. As for how to do it, only through dialogue,
communication within couples, the family, the community, within the
country as a whole. We must learn to live in harmony despite our
different ways of thinking. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
