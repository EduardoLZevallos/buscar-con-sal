<p><img alt="" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/venezuela_chavismo_2-2-2019.jpg.html" style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="400" /></p>

<p><em><strong>Caracas. Anyone following the coverage of the current situation in Venezuela will quickly draw the conclusion that corporate media is only telling one half of the story. It appears that there are massive demonstrations calling for President Mauro’s removal / resignation by fair means or foul all over the country.</strong></em></p>

<p>This is the media version of events and is simply a continuation of the same biased coverage of the last 20 years since President Chávez was elected. The real version of events is that Chavismo has been re-galvanized thanks to US threats against the President and the country by Trump, Bolton, Pompeo, Pence and Marco Rubio.</p>

<p>There has been scant if any coverage of the support in the streets almost every day since 23 January for President Maduro and the Venezuelan people have been rendered invisible by the media that are openly supporting the usurper Guaidó and a US coup solution for regime change in Venezuela.</p>

<p>One of the worst offenders is UK daily The Guardian which, day after day, continues with coverage as if trying to prove that the opposition is on the verge of removing Maduro from power. Add to this the coverage given to the countries that support Guaidó and the impression is that Maduro is isolated and on his way out.</p>

<p>An opinion piece in The Guardian by one Simon Tisdall, lays out the choices open to Maduro to solve the crisis. These are:</p>

<p>1. Stick with Maduro and hope things somehow improve</p>

<p>2. Risk an indigenous military takeover of indefinite duration</p>

<p>3. Negotiate an agreed, democratic transition leading to free elections, as advocated    by Guaidó</p>

<p>4. Face possible civil war and foreign intervention</p>

<p>In effect Tiscall gives Maduro Hobson’s Choice, as only option #1 is feasible since it falls within the precepts of the 1999 Constitution.</p>

<p>The chances of a military uprising would not happen without a split in the military and hence result a civil war. No one explains why the military should break their oath to defend the country and the Constitution and is just wishful thinking.</p>

<p>There is no possibility of option #3 as Guaidó has refused to hold talks with Maduro in the context of negotiations brokered by Mexico and Uruguay. He has probably refused as he is receiving orders from his US handlers not to give an inch so that warmongers such as Bolton et alia can maintain their saber-rattling pressure on Maduro.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="409" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/arturo_3-2-2019_1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" width="409" />There is no mention of a “transitional government” in the 1999 Constitution and so this idea which is often talked about freely in local media is a non starter.</p>

<p>Maybe Simon Tisdall should read the 1999 Constitution so that he could make recommendations or imagine scenarios that are legal in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Or maybe he thinks that the constitutional norms do not apply here in Venezuela. If that is the case then he is simply barking up the wrong tree.</p>

<p>To help Tisdall out and give him a reality check here are the choices that the Maduro government is considering.</p>

<p>1: Beef up the military and militias – the latter up to 2 million ready to fight by 13 April. As Maduro said in his speech yesterday: “If you want peqace, be prepared to defend it:”</p>

<p>2. Take delivery of advanced Russian weaponry due to arrive soon.</p>

<p>3. Ask the Constituent Assembly – which is plenipotentiary and no one can object or challenge its decisions- to bring forward the National Assembly elections due in 2020. Or alternatively, organize a recall referendum against the opposition deputies – one by one.</p>

<p>4. Continue to propose dialogue to find a solution to the current impasse so that peace is maintained.</p>

<p>5. Insist that the electoral timetable set out in the Constitution is followed with the next due elections being for the National Assembly and the next presidential elections due in December 2024.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="270" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/arturo_3-2-2019_2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="407" />6. Since the key bone of contention is going to be holding presidential elections again this year since the ones held on 20 May 2018 were not “free and fair”, Maduro has to ask for evidence to be provided of any fraud or irregularities that could have affected the outcome. Just because the opposition could not find a unifying candidate, they boycotted the elections and told their followers not to vote. There is no way any reasonable person can consider it correct to de-recognize the result and Madero’s crushing victory.</p>

<p>All the countries that recognize Guaido as interim president and not Maduro are simply casting aside all recognition of the institutions of the Venezuelan State – except the opposition controlled National Assembly that for them at least, is a law unto itself, makes up the rules as it goes along. It has refused to accept the constitutional interpretations and rulings of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In a nutshell this is a coup d’état in the making which the Maduro government, the military and great swathes of the population will not swallow.</p>

<p>The only way this can be imposed short to medium term is by foreign military action to oust Maduro but this looks increasingly unlikely since the US lost its attempts to receive authorization for intervention both in the OAS and the UN Security Council in the space of six days.</p>

<p>This is the reality of the situation in Venezuela and even though the opposition that supports Guaidó desperately wants Maduro out, they think twice when the possibility of a military invasion leading to a Syrian type war is explained to them. They have too much to lose in terms of businesses, houses, property and even the lives of their family.</p>

<p>For a peaceful resolution to the political logjam in Venezuela there is, in reality, for the opposition, just one choice thanks to Hobson! That is follow the Constitution and participate democratically, even negotiate, but don’t let yourself be manipulated into allowing foreign powers to meddle in our internal affairs – even if it is for $20 million in your own pocket. You could be dead tomorrow if it goes wrong along with thousands of innocent civilians both opposition and Chavista.</p>
