<p><strong>INTERVENTION BY AMBASSADOR LUIS ALVARADO<br />
AT THE EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF THE PERMANENT COUNCIL<br />
OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES (OAS)<br />
ON APRIL 5, 2019.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much Mr. President.</p>

<p>Brother Members of the Permanent Council<br />
of the Organization of American States:</p>

<p>President of the Permanent Council:</p>

<p>We come to this Special Session on Nicaragua with the Pride of having initiated a Negotiation Process that intends to work for National Understanding and Peace in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The Negotiation Table was installed on February 27, and the Sessions held to date, have been conducted with Respect and Intelligent Conversation around previously agreed upon agenda points and with adherence to the Roadmap which was also approved by the participants.</p>

<p>We must recognize the effective, diligent and professional facilitation work of the Witnesses and Guarantors who accompany this important avenue:</p>

<p>- His Excellency the Apostolic Nuncio, Re-presentative of His Holiness Pope Francis in Nicaragua, Monsignor Waldemar Stanis-law Sommertag.</p>

<p>- Special Adviser to the Secretary General of the OAS, Mr. Luis Angel Rosadilla, Representative of the Organization.</p>

<p>We have repeatedly recognized and appreciated the skill, capacity and high sense of responsibility of both Facilitators and their teams in the development of the negotiations.</p>

<p>To date, April 5, 2019, they have managed to agree and sign on:</p>

<p>1. An Agreement on the release of persons detained for disturbing the Peace, in accordance with the Nicaraguan Laws.</p>

<p>2. An Agreement to invite the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to accompany the Process of Reconciling Lists and Releasing of Persons Detained, in accordance with the established Procedures.</p>

<p>The Representatives of the ICRC are already in Nicaragua carrying out their work, in accordance with their Operating Standards.</p>

<p>We continue working to achieve Consensuses and Agreements on the Issues of: "Truth, Justice, Reparation, and Non-Repetition", as well as "Democracy and Electoral Reforms", which is the basis for celebrating Elections, according to the Nicaraguan Constitution.</p>

<p>The Delegation of the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity at the Negotiation Table has ratified every day, through its Presence and Communiques, the invariable Commitment of the State and the Government of Nicaragua, with the Points already agreed upon, as well as working hard toward reaching an agreement in relation to the pending Points.</p>

<p>As it is widely known, any Negotiation Process is complex, difficult and tests the Will of the Participants. Our Delegation has worked daily, showing a high sense of National Responsibility, Maturity, and Understanding, as demanded by the Nicaraguan families and people.</p>

<p>As evidence of the Commitment of the State and the Government of Nicaragua with the Agreements already signed, we have transferred detainees under the system of Family Coexistence, first 100 detainees were released, then 50, and today, April 5, another 50, totaling 200 personas, which by the Will of the Authorities of our Country, are already in their homes and with their relatives.</p>

<p>Nicaragua experienced 11 Years of Peace, Stability and Advances in the Fight against Poverty and for Human Development. Those 11 years demonstrated the ability of the Nicaraguan Families to live in harmony, according to our Culture and Tradition, working with the support of all State Institutions to improve their lives and that of their Communities.</p>

<p>The efforts and achievements of the Government of Nicaragua to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and to fulfill our Peoples needs in all aspects related to Economic, Social, Political and Cultural Rights, has been widely recognized by International Organizations.</p>

<p>Nicaragua ranks fifth in Gender Equality in the World, and has also been recognized for its high levels of Citizen Security and contributes to the containment of Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime, all of which are contributions to the Security and Peace of the Region.</p>

<p>Nicaragua has made significant progress in Programs of Restitution of Rights for Individuals, Families and Communities of Christian Tradition and Cultural Values, we have lived recognizing our History and our Capacity to transcend, from experience and learnings, the painful conflict of past decades.</p>

<p>Nicaragua has been, and we are sure that it will continue to be an Example of Growth and Progress with Social Justice, of Achievements for All, of Inclusion and Cohesion for the Good of All.</p>

<p>Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan Families have opted for Peace, Tranquility, Stability, working hard, with dedication and diligence, for a Culture of Reconciliation and Peace, approved on January 28 of this year in the Nicaraguan National Assembly, which must lead us toward the reestablishment of the indispensable Sense of Fraternity and Hope, which we have known.</p>

<p>We are deeply proud of our Historical Examples of Recovery of Peace and Understanding, in different circumstances and moments that have tested the Nicaraguan Character, definitively committed to Peace and Property.</p>

<p>By reiterating the Commitment of the State and the Government of Nicaragua with National Understanding, Reconciliation and Peace, we say in the words of our formidable Rubén Darío: “Here shines upon us, a Sun that does never declines..." and with the General of All Free Men and Women, Augusto C. Sandino: "Nicaragua will remain free, because it has sons and daughters who love her."</p>

<p>Peace, Peace, Peace, Darío clamored, and the Citizens of this Homeland that dream her large, we reiterate that Cry for Peace, which demands from the World the fundamental and inalienable Right to Live with Dignity, Respect and Tranquility.</p>

<p>At the gates of these New Times and Moments of our History, our determination to build Peace and Future, lives in all the Efforts and Commitments of our People that unite in majority, ratifying the Will and Commitment towards Harmonious Coexistence, and which demands consideration and recognition by all the International Community.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Brothers and Sisters of the Permanent Council.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. President.</p>
