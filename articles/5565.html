<em>Edmundo Gonzalez with supporters. Federico Parra/AFP</em></div>

<h2><strong>Now, a <em>New York Times</em> Hagiography of its Leader.</strong></h2>

<p>“On the campaign trail, she [María Corina Machado] was received almost as a religious figure, often wearing white, promising to restore democracy and reunite families torn apart by an economic crisis and mass migration. ‘María!’ her followers shouted, before falling into her arms,” the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/americas/venezuela-trump-maria-machado-democracy.html?emci=031365a7-bea5-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;emdi=1ce11427-c0a5-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;ceid=12618330"><em>New York Times</em></a> reverently reported.</p>

<p>Indeed, Machado’s personally chosen <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/04/27/in-venezuela-edmundo-gonzalez-urrutia-the-unknown-challenger-to-nicolas-maduro_6669685_4.html">surrogate</a> to contend in last July’s Venezuelan presidential election, Edmundo González, did fall into her arms. But that was because her <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/edmundo-gonzalezs-candidacy-in-jeopardy-due-to-health-issues/">infirm</a> disciple had trouble, both literally and figuratively, standing on his own two feet.</p>

<p>Machado was the main Venezuelan opposition figure backed by the US. Her platform of extreme neoliberal shock therapy was rejected by the electorate. Most Venezuelans <a href="https://www.hinterlaces.net/monitor-pais-61-de-los-venezolanos-rechaza-la-idea-de-privatizar-pdvsa/">oppose</a> her call to privatize nearly all state institutions serving the people – schools, hospitals, public housing, food assistance, and the state oil company, which funds social programs. Nor is there any popular appetite for Machado’s plan to radically reorient foreign policy to subordination to Washington and support of US imperial wars in Ukraine and Palestine.</p>

<p>A hagiography, such as this one by the <em>Times,</em> includes an investigation into the life and miracles attributed to the would-be saint. The article on Machado, penned by one Julie Turkewitz, does just that and more. The article also unintentionally reveals that the far-right opposition advocates foreign intervention to overthrow the democratic will of the Venezuelan people. Its title clearly states: “Trump to Save Her Country.”</p>

<p>It took the US until November 19, nearly four months, to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/blinken-calls-venezuelas-opposition-leader-gonzalez-president-elect-2024-11-19/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">declare</a> González as the legitimate president-elect of Venezuela. The recognition likely signals a shift in the lame-duck Biden administration’s policy from negotiation to all-out hostility towards Venezuela, paving the way for a smooth handover to the new Trump team. Previously, Washington simply <a href="https://www.state.gov/assessing-the-results-of-venezuelas-presidential-election/">called</a> for a “peaceful transition.”</p>

<h3><strong>The miraculous opposition primary</strong></h3>

<p>Turkewitz reported that Machado won “an overwhelming victory in a primary race.” She uses the weasel-construction “<em>a</em> primary” rather than “<em>the</em> primary,” because Machado’s “primary” was not one conducted by the official Venezuelan electoral authority, the CNE. Rather, it was a <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/far-right-opposition-primary-commission-opts-for-elections-without-venezuelas-national-electoral-council/">private</a> affair administered by the NGO <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/2024-venezuela-election-results">Súmate</a>. That NGO, as the article admits, is funded by the US.</p>

<p>Machado prevailed in a crowded field of 13 candidates with a miraculous 92% of the vote. When some of the other candidates called <a href="https://x.com/prospericarlos/status/1716428091172536659">fraud</a>, Machado had the ballots destroyed. She could do so because Súmate is her personal organization.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> intimates that Machado “galvanized a nation” around an opposition agenda. That is something Uncle Sam has so far failed to achieve despite a quarter of a century of <a href="https://chicagoalbasolidarity.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gftu-vsc-bklt-2-42160-copy-2-1.pdf">meddling</a> in Venezuela’s internal affairs.</p>

<p>The empire’s newspaper of record reports that Machado is “wildly popular.” But that’s in the halls of the US Congress, where she was <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/washington-promotes-opposition-candidate-setting-the-stage-for-delegitimizing-the-venezuelan-presidential-election/">vetted</a> and then anointed “leader of the opposition” even before the so-called primary in Venezuela. Unfortunately for Machado that popularity with the Yankee politicos did not travel as well back home. In Venezuela, even within her corner of the far-right, Machado is <a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/opinion/maria-corina-machado-what-the-mainstream-media-isnt-saying-about-her/">resented</a>. Far from unified, the opposition in Venezuela is today ever <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-hastens-collapse-of-far-right-justice-first-party/?utm_source=mailpoet&amp;utm_medium=ema%E2%80%A6">more divided</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Contested election results</strong></h3>

<p>The official Venezuelan electoral authority (CNE) declared incumbent President Nicolás Maduro the winner with 52% of the vote. That outcome was subsequently audited and <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/08/30/the-venezuela-elections-of-28-july-2024-what-and-whom-to-believe/">confirmed</a> by the Venezuelan supreme court (TSJ).</p>

<p>González, the person whom the <em>Times </em>declared the winner, came in second with 43% of the vote, according to the official count. González claimed that he had evidence that proved he won the presidency, but he <a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/venezuela-presidential-candidates-and-political-parties-submit-electoral-evidence-to-supreme-court-far-right-opposition-rejects-request/">refused</a> to show it to the TSJ, even when he was summoned to do so.</p>

<p>Moreover, the <em>Times</em> reports that the US-backed opposition has tallies from some 80% of the precincts, which were published on a private blog site. Sources supporting the Venezuelan government then published analyses showing that evidence to be bogus, while counter claims from those favoring regime change purport to confirm their validity.</p>

<p>The problem of privately posting evidence, while refusing to submit it to official channels, is that it leaves the Venezuelan authorities no constitutional path for accepting it even if it were valid. The question ignored by the article is: If “their team collected and published vote-tally receipts” proving its victory, why did they not settle the matter by submitting them?</p>

<p>The answer, not one that the <em>Times </em>would admit to, is that the far-right opposition and its US handlers never made a good faith attempt to win the election.</p>

<h3><strong>Washington’s strategy was to delegitimize the election, not to win it</strong></h3>

<p>The opposition’s platform could never be a winning ticket, which they knew. The only way to achieve it would be an extra-legal regime-change operation predicated on delegitimizing the democratically-elected government. And that is precisely what is being played out today in Venezuela.</p>

<p>There were a number of more moderate opposition figures with experience and popular followings. Had the US been interested in simply an electoral defeat of the ruling Socialist Party, they could have backed a less extreme candidate and offered to ease their punishing “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/08/02/venezuela-election-maduro-us-sanctions-democracy/?emci=17a39ae1-fa50-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&amp;emdi=db310e61-ff50-ef11-991a-6045bddbfc4b&amp;ceid=12618330">sanctions</a>” on Venezuela. Instead, Washington <a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2024/08/how-the-us-could-have-won-the-venezuelan-election/">backed</a> the far right, which took the supremely <a href="https://www.hinterlaces.net/monitor-pais-63-opina-que-los-dirigentes-que-pidieron-sanciones-deben-ser-juzgados/">unpopular</a> position of advocating for yet more sanctions on their own country to precipitate regime-change.</p>

<p>With nine other contenders on the presidential ballot, name recognition was important. Literally nobody had heard of González until Machado personally chose him as her surrogate. She had been <a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/venezuela-supreme-court-denies-maria-corina-machado-appeal-ratifies-political-ban/">disqualified</a> from running back in 2015 for constitutionally mandated offenses.</p>

<p>Machado’s political party,<em> Vente Venezuela</em>, lacked ballot status because her party had boycotted recent Venezuelan elections in keeping with the far-right’s stance that the Venezuelan state is not legitimate. Once the party decided to again participate in the electoral arena in 2024, she could have petitioned for recognition of her party. But she didn’t bother.</p>

<p>González, who had been in retirement, had no political following or experience. He had been a Venezuelan diplomat to El Salvador back in the 1980s, where he had been <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/salvadoran-ex-combatants-reveal-edmundo-gonzalezs-role-in-us-backed-massacres-in-el-salvador/">implicated</a> in supporting US-backed death squads.</p>

<p>Maduro crisscrossed the country in an all-out campaign effort, exhaustingly visiting over 300 municipalities. His ruling Socialist Party, in power since 1999, had cadre in every corner of the country who were mobilized. They didn’t need to be told that an opposition victory could mean not only loss of a job, but they might face retribution from the far right.</p>

<p>In contrast to Maduro’s strong ground game, the US-backed opposition was weak in the streets. González himself sat out the campaign in Caracas, while Machado barnstormed the hinterlands with a paper poster bearing his visage. Indicative of popular following were the turnouts at political rallies, both <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-president-maduro-closes-presidential-campaign-with-massive-rally-filling-caracas-streets/">during</a> the campaign and <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/venezuela-far-rights-great-international-protest-fails-denting-opposition-narrative-of-massive-support/">after</a>, where Maduro attracted many times more supporters than González.</p>

<h3><strong>Forecast</strong></h3>

<p>The <em>Times </em>not only maintains that González “won the July vote by a wide margin” but he “should be taking office in January.” González, too, claims he’ll <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ex-presidential-candidate-gonzalez-says-he-will-return-venezuela-take-office-2024-10-04/">be back</a> in Caracas for the inauguration. After the election, he <a href="https://orinocotribune.com/audio-recordings-proving-no-coercion-of-former-candidate-edmundo-gonzalez-published/">voluntarily</a> left Venezuela for Spain in a transfer negotiated with Caracas and Madrid governments.</p>

<p>The <em>Times </em>further reports that Machado predicts Maduro will voluntarily “negotiate his own exit.” Even more fantastic, the <em>Times</em> asserts González “garnered almost 70 percent of the vote.”</p>

<p>In a revealing lapse from her otherwise editorializing, Turkewitz correctly reported that Machado “has spent roughly two decades trying to remove Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, from power.” Conveniently omitted is that effort included a <a href="https://misionverdad.com/venezuela/los-patrocinantes-del-golpe-que-no-cesa-contra-venezuela">number of coup</a> attempts, including the 2002 US-backed coup that temporarily deposed then President Chávez. Machado signed the <a href="https://cepr.net/the-venezuela-coup-20-years-later/">infamous</a> Carmona Decree then, which voided the constitution and disbanded the courts, the legislature, and executive.</p>

<p>That 2002 coup lasted less than 48 hours because the people of Venezuela spontaneously rose up and confronted the traitorous military. If Machado indeed had the backing of 7 in 10 Venezuelans, she too could have taken the presidential palace regardless of the official election report.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/americas/venezuela-trump-maria-machado-democracy.html?emci=031365a7-bea5-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;emdi=1ce11427-c0a5-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;ceid=12618330">calls</a> her Venezuela’s “Iron Lady” for her “steely resolve.” Meanwhile <em>Hinterlaces,</em> <a href="https://www.hinterlaces.net/maria-corina-dejo-el-pelero/">reporting</a> from Venezuela, speculates Machado has fled the country:</p>

<p>“The failure of the insurrectionary strategy in the absence of a social explosion or a rupture in the Bolivarian civic-military alliance, the lack of convincing evidence on Edmundo González’s alleged electoral victory, since they do not really have the minutes to demonstrate it, convinced Machado to leave the country.”</p>

<p>Nicolás Maduro will be inaugurated on January 10. As confirmed by the Venezuelan supreme court, the majority voted for him to continue Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution.</p>
