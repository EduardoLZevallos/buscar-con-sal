<p><i><b>Message from the President-Commander Daniel to the Nicaraguan People</b></i><br />
<i><b>on the Fifth Anniversary of Nicaragua's new Great Historical Victory</b></i><br />
<br />
<i><b>April 19, 2023</b></i><br />
<br />
Good afternoon, Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters, Families of this Blessed Land.<br />
<br />
Today, April 19th 2023, is the fifth anniversary of a Nicaragua's  great new historical victory in the struggle for Peace. And this date coincides with the first battle our Ancestors fought, where our roots come from that give us strength, give us dignity, give us fighting dpirit.<br />
<br />
On April 17th back in the year 1523, that is to say 500 years ago, the first defense of these lands took place, when the invaders led by Gil González were defeated by the Cacique Diriangén... 500 years ago!<br />
<br />
There is the letter that Gil González sent , the report that Gil González sent to the King, informing him that there were thousands who were attacking him and the criminals that accompanied him, that there were thousands of indigenous people defending these Lands, who were being invaded with the force of the sword and with the sacrilegious manipulation of the Cross; using Christ, who is the greatest Symbol of Peace that Humanity can have, to murder those who were the owners of these lands, those who had their own identity, their own culture.<br />
<br />
And we inherited, of course, we inherited those roots, we come from those roots, and that is why Nicaragua is a People that has always fought for Peace, and has fought for Peace against those who have come to attack this Nation, its sovereignty and to intervene in our lands.<br />
<br />
We already know, so I'm not going to go through the chronology of the history of the invasions of the Yankee Empire in Nicaragua. How many invasions, how many aggressions, and how many defeats suffered by the imperialists of the Earth, in this Nicaragua that has always defended Peace.<br />
<br />
On this day we are paying tribute to the Caciques Diriangén, Nicarao and all the Caciques who gave their lives defending their lands, these lands, against the European invaders who arrived with all the force their armamenta gave them; they had weapons that were unknown here, our Ancestors fought with arrows, with spears, and with those weapons they achieved the first defeat of the imperialists of the Earth, in that combat about which the criminal Gil González informed the Kings of Spain.<br />
<br />
A criminal! There he brags about how they were looking for how to bind and hang the Indians, how they enjoyed it, as if they were dealing with animals. But the strength of spirit was greater, and two important events took place at that moment: One, Nicarao's dialogue with Gil González, which is the first moment in which the confrontation took place between, the thought, the ideology, the philosophy of the European Imperialists, and the philosophy of a Cacique who is on his lands and at Peace, and suddenly they arrive and come to him saying that either he gets baptized or they'll will kill him.<br />
<br />
Yes, with sign of the Cross, the criminal priests of those times with the Cross, imagine, distorting Christ. When would Christ ever have accepted being used to commit crimes like that!<br />
<br />
In the same way as has been done throughout history in many parts of the world, and what was done here in Nicaragua and repeated five years ago with the attempted coup d'état against the Nicaraguan people. A People that was at peace, that had a growing economy. A People  among which we had achieved reconciliation between all the economic, social groups, businessmen, workers, peasants, artisans, bankers.<br />
<br />
We had all reached a great consensus, the political forces, everyone, and the country had been growing, since 2007 it had been recovering from the destruction in which Nicaragua had been left by the neoliberal governments, 17 years of neoliberal governments.<br />
<br />
The country was growing, the economy was growing, employment was growing, security was growing and multiplying, education, housing, everything was growing, it was multiplying, but then came the same, descendants of Cain, the descendants of Cain conspiring against their sisters and brothers. Serving whom? Serving the imperialists, the empires, Yankees, Europeans, and also Church leaders.<br />
<br />
I have already said, not all the priests did so, but we all witnessed how the churches were converted, not all the churches, but many churches became Barracks from where armed groups emerged to attack the population, and to attack the police units every day, when the Police had orders not to respond to those attacks.<br />
<br />
How priests desecrated Christ, with no respect for God, guiding the criminals when they had a Nicaraguan youth, a woman or a policeman captured, tied up, painted, beaten, bleeding, how then they poured fuel on them, setting them on fire to him, and how they filmed the crime themselves.<br />
<br />
The pharisees wearing cassocks and speaking in the name of Christ do not see this, and now for Holy Week, to avoid provocation, they were told to carry out the activities there in the Churches or near the Churches, and some of them objected strongly. Why? Because they wanted blood. They want blood, they want death, they want schools, hospitals to burn, they want destruction.<br />
<br />
And how much patience we had, I remember telling you at those moments, compañeros, Nicaraguan sisters and brothers, how I was asking God to give me patience, and in the meantime trying to persuade them in the famous dialogues, to suspend the roadblocks of death. And back then many of the bishops participating were encouraging the terrorists... Bishops of the devil! Bishops of Satan! They cannot be bishops of Christ, they are not entitled to walk with that Cross on their chest, they dishonor that Cross when they display it on their chest, they profane the Sacred Host  when they raise it in their blood-stained hands.<br />
<br />
None of this has to do with Christianity, nor with Christ, nor with Catholicism. No government in this history has promoted and supported religious holidays as we have. Which Government has promoted the festivals in the municipalities, in the departments, the feasts of La Purísima, the Christmas festivities? The only Government that has done that has been ours, in two main periods: The first perriod in the years 1979 to 1990, and the second period, from 2007 until the terrorism exploded.<br />
<br />
Until that moment we and been trusting and despite there being priests or religious who were provoking violence, trying to promote violence among the People, but,  until that time, the People had not fallen for that game, until that April 19th five years ago, violence began to take hold in our nation, and with violence the Peace we had in Nicaragua was being buried.<br />
<br />
This was a country at Peace, and those participating in the Great Consensus, in the Great Reconciliation, many of them simply joined the violence, because the Yankee government threatened them, that if they did not join the violence, that if they did not send their workers to the streets, that if they did not provoke strikes, then they were going to be sanctioned, sanctioning their wealth, because they have their money there in the United States, and under sanctions they lose that money they have in the United States banks.<br />
<br />
And we saw businessmen there who were spokespersons for our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, let's remember well the person who was the leader of COSEP, President of COSEP, we met, we sat down, they gave him the floor, he spoke and he made a constructive message; but, well, unfortunately he did not have the strength to resist the Yankee pressure.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I understand that we are not all made of the same wood, and there is wood that is rotten and breaks easily. On the other hand, the wood that made from the blood of Diriangén, of Nicarao, that wood is stronger than steel. And it was a tragedy...!<br />
<br />
I just remind all Nicaraguans to think for a moment about what Nicaragua was like five years ago, to see if you could walk along the streets, to see if you could live peacefully in your houses. Everyone was terrified. And the deaths every day, and the people they were murdered, they blamed on the government, on the Police, and the Police were in their stations, which was the decision we had taken.<br />
<br />
The summit moment of all this was what I have mentioned before but I have to mention it today, and remember it, and hopefully the bishops will reconsider and the Vatican will also reconsider, the Vatican grown and forged in the land of Caligula and Nero, there it has been forged, in the land of Caligula and Nero, and where really there they have become just another, interventionist state, serving the imperialists of the Earth.<br />
<br />
I cannot forget when His Holiness, Pope John Paul II came, we made an extraordinary effort to mobilize the Nicaraguan people from all over the country, we used all the available transport to bring the people to the square where the Pope officiated the mass. And there were the Mothers of the Heroes who had been killed by the counterrevolution, and there was my mother too, a devout Catholic mother.<br />
<br />
And we had to negotiate, because there were bishops, priests and people from the Vatican who, when they were negotiating, wanted those who received Communion from the Pope to be only relatives of enemies of the Revolution. So it was necessary to negotiate, 50% of ladies, relatives of enemies of the Revolution, and 50% Mothers of Heroes killed by the Counterrevolution. Because they did not want to give Communion to the Mothers of the Heroes. And there were the Mothers of San José de las Mulas, of those young boys who had been murdered during those days.<br />
<br />
And what was the cry that irritated the Pope? And what was the cry that irritated some bishops? "We want peace!" That was the cry with which His Holiness John Paul II was received: "We want peace!, We want peace! Holiness, we want peace!" And that cry of "We want peace!" was unwelcome to him.<br />
<br />
And how much the Mothers begged the Pope there: Holy Father, a prayer for our children! Holy Father, a prayer for our children! Christian Mothers, Catholic Mothers, Mothers who Believe in the Pope, but he did not pray for our children, he did not do so, instead he got upset and shouted: "Silence!" Like a good dictator, like a good tyrant he shouted, "Silence!"<br />
<br />
We cannot forget him, with all the respect I had for him at that time, and I still have him in my memory, because I understood well that he was a Pope who came with a mentality totally removed from the essence of Christ and Christianity, and was manipulated by the Government of Ronald Reagan.<br />
<br />
And what did they say to him? That here the Revolution was coming to impose atheism, when in fact we incorporated Catholic priests into the Government. And I remember the first visit we made to the Pope in the Vatican, the National Literacy Crusade was coming. When I speak to the Pope and say: Your Holiness, we have put a priest, Father Fernando Cardenal, at the head of the National Literacy Crusade, together with the Minister of Education.<br />
<br />
As a sign, with faith, that we are believers, we have grown up believing in God, believing in Christ, who could think, if they are a believer, who could think we are going to preach atheism. Our preaching, our practice has been of believers. But it is one thing to believe in God, it is one thing to believe in Christ, and it is another thing to believe in the performance of what Christ himself called pharisees, whiteed sepulchres, whom he whipped out of the Temple. Because Christ did not  attend the Temple, nor did he go to live in the Temple, but he went to live with the People, with the poor.<br />
<br />
And because the people were shouting: "We want peace!", because they were asking the Pope for a prayer, and the Pope did not want to offer the prayer. And then when he was really upset, he first said "Silence!" and as the people kept asking: "Holy Father, a prayer for our children! We want peace!" then he shouted: "The Pope also wants peace!" Look what a way to respond, in no way Christian, nothing Christian!<br />
<br />
Even when we went to the airport to see him off, I talked to him and explained what the People meant when they said, "We want peace!" We are at war here, they are killing us, they are murdering us. And what the people want is for you to speak out for peace. And he was just impassive.<br />
<br />
And in the farewell message at the airport I told him the same thing, and he simply made no reference to Peace, he just went and got on the plane, and they made a worldwide scandal, saying that we had disrespected the Pope by shouting that "We want Peace!" That's what these people were shouting: "We want peace!" Who can want war, who can want death after so much pain, so much suffering, so many wars this People has lived through?<br />
<br />
Then, we left the government, the Pope had a second visit here to Nicaragua with the new government, which was naturally a government imposed by the Yankees, and on that occasion he had another famous expression which clearly indicated his political, ideological and non-Christian preference.<br />
<br />
Later, on a tour we were doing in Europe, I asked him for an audience; I thought, maybe the Pope has understood the reality of our people better by now. And he gave me the audience, and I acknowledge that because he made that gesture of giving me the audience. Well, I was trying to explain to him what was happening in Nicaragua and what was happening later with the neoliberal governments.<br />
<br />
Because when I came to him the first time we were starting the National Literacy Campaign, and that's what I told him and that we had a priest at the head of the National Literacy Campaign, so that he wouldn't go around believing that we were going to sow atheism among the youth and among the People.<br />
<br />
And when I met him again there in the Vatican, then he listened to us, I felt that he listened to me attentively, and I said to him: You see, those governments that you came to bless at that time, they are taking land from the peasants, land that the Revolution gave them; they are taking housing, factories from the workers. That is the struggle now in Nicaragua, education and health are being privatized, illiteracy is growing in Nicaragua. The illiteracy that we had managed to reduce was already growing again in the country.<br />
<br />
I was explaining all that to the Pope on that second occasion, and it was as an act of seeking understanding, understanding that it was very difficult for the Pope to understand what our Revolution meant, because the reality of what the Papacies have been is that they have served the rich, they have served the oligarchies, they have served royalty.<br />
<br />
The Popes crowned kings there in the Vatican... Kings, imagine! Kings who were great criminals and who lived warring among themselves to take over Europe and warring among themselves to take over Africa and Asia, and who when they discovered these lands that they did not know existed, then it was only to fight among themselves over what they wanted and the English were in conflict here with the Spaniards, those Empires were in conflict over Nicaragua, between the English and the Spanish.<br />
<br />
So, that is the culture that was formed in the Vatican and which is still always present there, unfortunately, that what they did was to ratify the Kingdoms; that has been their role, accomplices of Kings, and they themselves acting as Kings and sanctifying criminal actions against the world's Peoples.<br />
<br />
I even think that they did all this really, not out of calculation, but simply because they occupy a structure mounted on the medieval structures that later gave the Vatican life, shaping is as a State.<br />
<br />
Christ never said it had to be a State. Christ never said so! Where does Christ say it? Let a priest show me where Christ says that such a State had to be made, and the Vatican State is just one more State in the World. It is a state, yes, the Vatican State, and it has its banks and it has its police, and it has its intelligence structures, and it has a vertical command structure, there is no democracy there, it has a totally vertical command structure,  just as the Roman Emperors exercised it. In the same way! Just as the Roman Emperors used to do! Just like Nero did, just like Caligula did... The same, the same thing, the same!<br />
<br />
Christ never said let's make a State, he never said that! It didn't occur to him. It didn't even occur to him to go ahead and build a Cathedral... No! Christ walked among the People from top to bottom, offering a hand to the poor, healing the sick, and then when they sacrificed him, Christ gave His life as what he was: The Son of God. Gave his life without hatred, gave his life without fighting, gave his life in Peace.<br />
<br />
The sacrifice of Christ is truly sublime, extraordinary. And if there is a hero in the entire History of humankind, that hero is Christ, who has nothing to do with what happened here over the years, in particular five years ago with that coup attempt.<br />
<br />
As I say, hopefully the bishops, the priests, will reflect, think about Christ a little and start acting like Christians, and not feel that because they wear a habit, they wear a cassock, they have the strength and the authority to do what they like.<br />
<br />
For me the most surprising thing about all this was, apart from the criminal activities of those who set young people on fire, the police officers, the compañeros, to tell them: Go dispose of them it in the latrine! Said by a priest, and the Vatican didn't say anything, and the bishops here didn't say anything either, just letting the priest continued in his Temple, shouting. There are the videos, there are the videos even now where the priest figures and the priest's voice is heard telling them to go throw the body in the toilet so that no trace remains. And he himself says, he speaks with his own name, simply because, since they believed that we were already defeated, they spoke in a way caring little about identifying themselves, they identified themselves by name, indeed.<br />
<br />
That was the step that had already been taken, the political opposition, the enemies of the People asking for the government, the State, the Revolution to fall, after, that's not unusual, but when the bishops, all of them, asked us for a meeting, and we went and held the meeting there in the Casa de los Pueblos, we held the meeting there and all the Bishops took part.<br />
<br />
In fact, we thought they wanted to talk to see how the country might be made calmer. But what did they leave us with? The introduction was made by a bishop whose name I won't mention; he made the introduction, just saying that they had asked for that meeting because they wanted to present to us, give us a document and several of them spoke more or less in those terms.<br />
<br />
Then, the individual who likes to parade with the Blessed Sacrament through the streets, on a float, started talking, he was the one who took the floor and started, started, started talking like the great leader of the opposition.<br />
<br />
They handed us the letter, they passed the letter to us. I took the letter, flipped through it, noting it. Rosario was there, Denis Moncada was there, and I showed it to them... A coup d'etat! The bishops were carrying out a coup d'état! Their lords the bshops calmly carrying out a coup d'état, with their signatures, with all their full names and surnames! Signed by all of them; there was not a single bishop who did not sign, they all signed, even those who seemed more moderate.<br />
<br />
The fact is they forced them to sign, the ones who didn't want to sign they forced them to sign as well, that's the truth. Because I am sure that many of those bishops would not have signed. But everyone's signatures were there, on that occasion when they gave us their ultimatum, they gave us a few hours for the Judiciary to disappear, for Parliament, the Police and the Army to disappear and for us to go to blazes.<br />
<br />
Imagine, written by them. Who gave this power to the Church? Who gave this power to the Bishops to remove and put in place a government? Who? And the Vatican was aware of all that, and the Vatican consented to all that. Because in the Vatican there are also different currents, there are currents that are more moderate, there are currents that are closer to what the faith of Christianity is, and there are currents that with the Soul full of poison, they have the devil in their heart, they are the devil incarnate, and to top it off, the devil with the Cross, imagine, on his chest. What a sacrilege! That is a sin, a sacrilege, for those demons to walk around with the Cross on their chest, and with that Cross to manipulate, seeking to manipulate, wanting to manipulate and wanting bloodshed and seeking to remove Governments.<br />
<br />
But really, I wasn't going to argue with them, nor was I going to give them explanations, nor did it bother me, because it really was so ridiculous that. I thought in my heart, they really believe the story of what they told us in the Dialogue that all of us were going have to leave, that there would not be room for all of us on the plane. But the ones who left on the plane were themselves, they are the ones who left on the plane; we are here with the People. But remember in the Dialogue that was what they shouted at us and the calm priests there called no one to order, instead encouraging them to shout even more.<br />
<br />
So, at that moment I thought, these people believe we already have one foot on the plane, we already have the plane ready. They're crazy! I thought. But well, I didn't want to say anything to them. Okay, we'll consider it, I told them, of course yes, with diplomacy, with courtesy. Why fight there with them? Because at the end of the day, I say, poor devils, yes, poor devils! May God forgive them, as I forgive them too, I forgive them too, yes; I harbor no hatred for them, I have never harbored hatred.<br />
<br />
I remember that I have always had in mind, Lord , make me an instrument of peace. Where there is hatred, let us sow love. Yes, every day I say that prayer, and as my mother taught me from childhood, she would say to me: Son, every day pray three Our Fathers and three Hail Marys. I pray the three Our Fathers and the three Hail Marys every day. Because I believe in Christ and I believe in God.<br />
<br />
I hope that already on this fifth anniversary where we have recovered Peace, today, on our Day of Peace, who ridicules us because we are talking about Peace? Who are the ones making fun of us? Those filled with hatred, those who hate Peace, they mock andbecause they mock, they do not want peace, they want instability, they want terror. And I hope, indeed, that the bishops, the priests, who have been very active, and are still very active, some here inside the country and others outside the country, will think again and take into account that the way Christ points out to us is the Way of Peace, and they have to get rid of that hatred they have inside, to banish it, as a tribute to those who have died because of that hatred.<br />
<br />
Today, on this Day of Peace, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, we had the opportunity to receive the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov. He was accompanied by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Ryabkov, who deals with relations with Nicaragua particularly; the Russian Ambassador to Nicaragua, Alexander Khokholikov; the Director of the Department of Foreign Policy Planning of the Russian Federation, Alexey Drobinin; the Director of the Information and Press Department, we see her there frequently on television giving reports. She's always there, reporting. She's the Spokeswoman for the Russian Government's Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova.<br />

<p>Director of the Altin Americna Department, Alexander Shchetinin;  head of Federal Agency "Rossotrudnichestvo", Eugeny Primakov; the Deputy Director of the Latin America Department, Elena Kudryavtseva; the Minister Counselor of the Russian Embassy in Nicaragua, Svetlana Petrova; the First Secretary of the Russian Embassy in Nicaragua, Maria Sindeeva, and the Assistant to the Minister, the Foreign Minister, Ekaterina Izotova.<br />
<br />
The translators should not be left out, of course, Ksenia Karash, First Secretary of the Linguistic Department, and Anastasia Ionova, Third Secretary of the Linguistic Department. And then too, more than 30 Journalists, you saw them here, a large group of journalists, and along with the media that came there were, as  I was telling you, all these that I have mentioned to you, and then those of the Russian media, there are here a lot of Russian media: Russia Today, Russia 1, Russia 1, Channel One, Channel One, NTV, on the Day of Peace, remember; from Izvestia, from NTV, from the other TV station, that is, number of TV stations.<br />
<br />
So we are talking about an impressive delegation of journalists; they came from Venezuela, from meeting with our brother, President Nicolás Maduro, and from here they have left for Havana where they will have meetings with our brother Miguel Díaz-Canel, and certainly they will greet Army General, Comandante of the Revolution, Raúl Castro.<br />
<br />
First of all, of course, we talked about Peace, on this Day of Peace, when the Russian Federation is waging a Battle for Peace. But it is not against a nation, it is against the fascists, the Nazis, who 16 years ago staged a coup in Ukraine and took over there. It is Hitler's children who are ruling there, the children, the grandchildren of Hitler, of Goebbels. Because the Nazis during the war managed to install a large force there, one that remained there and started to make war on the Russians, to persecute them; even Russians born in those lands, killing them, and culminating in the coup d'état; and meanwhile, NATO intimidating Russia, surrounding it with more weapons, more bases, and the United States conducting its orchestra of international terrorists.<br />
<br />
It has been a hard, difficult, painful situation, we are hurt by the death of any Human Being, we are hurt by the death of the young Russians who are falling in combat, of the young Ukrainians who are falling in combat. And we want peace, as Russia wants it, as the Peoples of the World want it, as Countries like Brazil have already been calling for, Lula has called for it, Mexico has called for it, Xi Jinping, the President of the People's Republic of China, has called for it.<br />
<br />
That is to say, how to achieve a state of opinion among the Nations of the planet, which allow for guarantees, security to be given to the Russian people, who live on their lands because those lands belong to them. Ukraine belongs to those Russian-Ukrainians, it belongs to them too, they were born there, they grew up there, they lived there during the Second World War, when the Nazis murdered thousands and thousands of Russians there.<br />
<br />
So, that there can be the kind of understanding that puts an end to that war, in which of course there have to be guarantees for those Russian People, and that should also have as a result, once Peace is restored, the corresponding guarantees of what belongs to the Russian Federation in terms of territory, Elections can then take place, such that it is the People and not a coup d'état like the one brought about by the Europeans and the United States 16 years ago, defining the route of an entire Nation with so much conflict.<br />
<br />
I think that World War III is already being lived out here, this is World War III, why? Because the United States and Europe are using Ukraine to find how to disappear Russia. The same thing that happened in World War II. In the Second World War, when Hitler formed his party in Germany, no one criticized him, no one condemned him in Europe, rather big European capital and big United States capital supported him so that he could occupy the leadership of that country.<br />
<br />
The enemy at that time was not Hitler, the enemy was Russia, the Soviet Union was the enemy that the Europeans and the United States had in their sights; the Soviet Union was the enemy they had blockaded, slandered, making conspiracies of all kinds against the Soviet Union.<br />
<br />
And well, all of a sudden, Hitler, a child of capitalism, a child of European and American democracy, is their son, it occurred to him to follow Napoleon: Take over Europe to take over Russia. And for the United States, when they saw the strength that Hitler had and the way he was advancing, nothing remained but to ally with the Soviet Union.<br />
<br />
There was no other way open for them. Why? Because the Soviet Union stood in the way. For Hitler to later challenge the United States, he had to first occupy, destroy and defeat the Soviet Union. And it was that heroic struggle of Russia, with millions and millions of lives, by which Hitler was defeated.<br />
<br />
The first troops that entered the bunker, back in Germany, in Hitler's bunker, were the troops of the Soviet Union and there they placed the Flag of the Red Army. They were the first to enter. That is, Germany's great defeat, and the victory of the world's Peoples depended on the Russian People, on the Red Army, on the Soviet People.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="230" src="http://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/355474.jpeg" width="450" /></p>

<p>Now we are seeing the same story, that is, we have the Europeans who have become ensnared, listening to the Gringos. The President of France has already said it: We cannot continue to be subjected to the policies dictated by the United States; we have to form our own policy, our own force and not be an instrument. He said it and caused an upset in the US government. Why? Because Europe is suffering, the European peoples are suffering from that war, all the peoples there are suffering from that war. And also the US people are beginning to feel the effects of that war in terms of the financial aspect, the economic aspect.<br />
<br />
And this is already a War III because everyone is involved in that war. The CELAC Countries, I would say they have been careful not to interfere here, there has been an attitude of neutrality, and a demand that an Agreement for Peace be sought; what is being asked for is Peace, Peace, Peace, Peace!<br />
<br />
We were talking with the Foreign Minister about the efforts that the Russian Federation and President Putin, have been making to seek Peace with Security, and that's what Europe has to understand, that there has to be peace in a New World. This war is the Third War that is taking place in the World, which I am sure no one wants to escalate further with nuclear weapons, because then no one will be left on the planet.<br />
<br />
It is life or death for humanity and for all nations, therefore, the European nations have to be concerned, the US people themselves have to be concerned, because the security of the whole world is at stake.<br />
<br />
And speaking about the issue of Peace, the struggle for Peace, Lula, President of Brazil, when the Foreign Minister was there also, he too spoke about how to develop a movement for Peace. How bringing stability and security to that region is to bring stability and security to the World. The world already depends on the results and the efforts made for peace.<br />
<br />
Of course we talked about what cooperation means in these conditions, you see,  given what Russia is experiencing, they are not easy, how their economy has been blockaded, the terrible sanctions have been applied to them, but they are managing to sustain themselves, even growing in some aspects, in economic activities, in exports.<br />
<br />
And speaking of the cooperation of the Russian Federation with Nicaragua, that is to say,  the position of solidarity of the Russian People with the Peoples of the World is clear, when it gave its greatest demonstration of Solidarity in World War II, there were 20, 30, 40 million human beings sacrificed there for Peace and to defeat Nazism.<br />
<br />
Also, and to conclude, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters so we have time to watch the telenovelas and movies, because now there is no baseball, I asked first if there was any baseball, if there had been baseball we would not be doing this national radio and television network, I don't like to affect Baseball, or if there were sports events of this or that pending, or a good match like the one coming up soon.<br />
<br />
So, today, the Day of Peace here in Nicaragua, consider well, Nicaragua despite everything, the aggression we have suffered, despite everything and the fierce campaign against our Country, against our People. At this moment, I imagine, the closing session of a meeting is now being concluded, which is a meeting of the Armies of Our Americas.<br />
<br />
This meeting began on Monday, April 17th and is the Fifth Special Meeting of the Conference of American Armies with the theme: ”Security and Defense Challenges in the 21st Century", in which representatives of the armies of 15 countries and the Conference of Central American Armed Forces are participating as observers.<br />
<br />
15 countries, see for yourselves! This naturally angers those who carry hatred in their hearts for the People of Nicaragua, for Peace, for stability. Because they must say to themselves: How is it possible that they are meeting with the Nicaraguan Army? When there have been campaigns against the Nicaraguan Army, sanctions against the Nicaraguan Army. The Army General Staff, Army Commanders, and Army General Julio César Avilés have been at the closing session of this Meeting.<br />
<br />
And the topics have been: "The Challenges in Security and Defense in the 21st Century”, "The Challenges and Threats in the New Operational Future to 2040", looking at the long term; "The Formation and Value System of the Members in the Armies of the 21st Century”, ”The contribution of the Armies to Hemispheric and Regional Security“, ”Military Integration as a relevant factor in strengthening Cooperation Mechanisms".<br />
<br />
In this Special Conference whose Presidency Brazil has for the moment, but in the previous meeting they had agreed that the headquarters of the Meeting was going to be in Nicaragua, and there is the unknown, who will come to Nicaragua, with that fierce campaign that the Europeans, the Yankees have against Nicaragua?<br />
<br />
So, who are the top Commanders of Armies who are participating in this meeting, who have taken part? From Brazil, which is currently presiding over the Conference; Argentina, Canada, of course the United States is not coming, could come, but as it is Nicaragua, it is not coming; well, Canada came; Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and as Observers, the Conference of the Central American Armed Forces. You see, a good representation, on the Day of Peace here in Nicaragua, part of the struggle for Peace.<br />
<br />
The Presidency of the Conference is currently with Brazil, for the period 2022-2023, 2 years; then the Presidency passes to Mexico in the period 2024-2025, those two years.<br />
<br />
So we congratulate General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Commander-in-Chief of our Army, the Commanders of our Army, the soldiers of our Army, the officers, the relatives of our Army, because this meeting is a message for Peace, on the Day of Peace.<br />
<br />
So, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, thanks be to God, dusk is already falling for us, entering the evening and Nicaragua is at Peace... Thanks be to God! And again I call on all Nicaraguans, all the bishops, all the priests, I call on all the Nicaraguans who are out there talking about how they are going to plant bombs, that they are going to do this, that they are going to do that, that they are going out to kill, that they forget about that, and that we all unite to continue working for Peace, in this Blessed and Always Free Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
Long live Christian, Solidarity committed and Socialist Nicaragua!<br />
<br />
Long live the Heroes of the Original Resistance that 500 years ago defeated the invaders with the Cacique Diriangén at the head!<br />
<br />
Long live the people of Nicaragua!<br />
<br />
Long live Nicaragua's Youth!<br />
<br />
Long live Nicaragua's Families!<br />
<br />
Long live Christ!<br />
<br />
Long live Christ, Our Lord God!<br />
<br />
Long live Blessed and Always Free Nicaragua!<br />
<br />
Long live Sandino!<br />
<br />
Sandino Lives On!<br />
<br />
A Free Nation or Death!<br />
<br />
The Struggle for Peace continues, Always Further On!<br />
<br />
Thank you, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters.<br />

<p>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the message of President Comandante Daniel to the People of Nicaragua<br />
<br />
April 19th 2023<br />
<br />
How are you? How are you, Juan? Good evening, and a warm embrace to all Nicaragua's families, fraternally we give each other Peace. Today, after that intense historical journey that our Comandante Daniel, our President, has made, what more should I say? One can always add something more, first of all, to remember how all Nicaraguans suffered in the face of this criminal assault on Peace and the Will of a People that has always fought for Peace, because we have wanted Peace.<br />
<br />
To remember the families, the mothers who were truly terrorized by that evil and diabolical intention to mount a coup against us as a State, a State that belongs to the People, that serves the People, to strike us as a People. To kill, to destroy, to stop development, to stop well-being. Because, of course, it is selfishness that prevails among the servants of the Empire... Sheer selfishness! They have never cared how the poor or impoverished families of this Nicaragua live, they have never cared, they have always thought only about themselves and how to better serve the imperialists of the Earth, believing that they will be paid more.<br />
<br />
These are the hours we are re-living, with painful memories, the nights when we received so many calls from so many grieving mothers who asked us to do something to stop the bloodbath. It was a massacre, one also filmed and reproduced with pleasure. How they enjoyed the images of the horror they created themselves. This is a disease of the soul. Hatred is sick. Really, a pathology of the heart.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to understand Human Beings who torture, who burn, who threaten, who destroy, who terrorize and film everything to enjoy their reproduction, seeking to terrorize more and more. Sick! Poor creatures! And how after that diabolical interval, how they have had to flee their country, how horrible, because no one here wants violence and no one here wants the promoters of violence.<br />
<br />
Comandante Daniel says: I don't carry hatred, I forgive... I think we all forgive, because we are not hateful beings, the hard thing is to forget, and I'm frank, I'm sincere: One can't forget! What happened in Nicaragua hurts, and especially the behavior of those who proclaimed themselves as emissaries or intermediaries of Christ hurts. It hurts because one was brought up with Christian, Catholic Values, the majority in Nicaragua was Catholic, but now there is another reality.<br />
<br />
How it hurts that adulteration, that manipulation, that desecration of symbols that are and should be symbols of Love, of Redemption, of Salvation, of Peace, of Justice. Of course it hurt us and it's hard to forget that pain. One is not filled with hatred, but one does not forget and that is precisely the strength we have: Not-forgetting means No-Repetition, and that is why each of us is a fervent Defender of Peace.<br />
<br />
And when one sees the misfortune in which the same traitorous sell-out plunged themselves , because everything is the result of their actions; every action has a reaction, and truly, Love is paid with Love, but Hatred is unrecognized and so it is a matter of distancing it, of dispersing it, so that it never fills the heart of anyone in this blessed nation again.<br />
<br />
They must suffer, and no one is glad, of course, no one can be glad about anyone's suffering, but well, enough of that for now, enough of living thinking that hatred may bathe this blessed nation in blood again... Stop it at once! I say to all the people who made that mistake with Nicaragua: Enough is enough!<br />
<br />
We are a People of values, of a culture of Peace, Brave, Courageous... Defenders of our own, it's true. Of course, defenders of our lands that are sacred to us. Of course, and above all we are able to expel, as we have been able to, those who seek to dominate us, subjugate us and plunder us. That's true!<br />
<br />
But that does not mean that we live with bitterness, with an sour or super-acidic Heart... No! There is Joy here. It is amazing to see how every weekend, in the moments that we have to rest or enjoy recreation, everywhere is filled, and with Joy is filled, and how we celebrate all those traditional holidays that are originally religious holidays and that are celebrated with Joy, in different ways throughout the Country. And even so they say that we are atheists.<br />
<br />
And always in our homes we are full of those symbols of the faith in which we grew up, our sacred images, our candles, our novenas, our prayers, our music, our songs always. All that, the sum of all that, fills this country with blessed strength, with bliss.<br />
<br />
I say again that it hurt us and it still hurts us when we see People who claim to represent Christ, but who profane Christian values, who are really moved by selfishness, by greed, by the desire for prominence, and it's not even a religious prominence, it's a political prominence.<br />
<br />
What we experienced that day at the Casa de los Pueblos was truly incredible. To see those faces and to see that voice, a voice that came out of mental and spiritual inadequates... Complete inadequacy! A voice and a person who wanted to take ownership of this country, like that song: surely a gringo song, about an owner in this country. That song we used to sing in the 80s, or even before. A person who believed he owned this country and believed he had the right to insult the legitimately elected authorities, who had worked to improve the living conditions of Nicaraguan families.<br />
<br />
And the truth is that, at that moment, characters like that set themselves up as the leaders or chief promoters of the criminal coup attempt, and that is what is incredible, inconceivable and painful, I will not say unforgivable, because we have the obligation, as Christians, to forgive, but we also have the duty not to forget, and I will never forget the pain of so many families who wrote to us, who called us by phone, and who told us: We feel helpless because the Police are in their stations.<br />
<br />
What terrible things the same people did who thought they owned this country, asking for the police to stay in their stations, so as to make it easier for criminals to go about, burning, killing, torturing and reproducin their crimes and misdeeds on the so-called social networks, those networks of mass destruction.<br />
<br />
How are we going to forget that image of the heroine Amada Pineda's son, burning in the street? How are we going to forget? How are we going to forget the compañero Gabriel de Jesús Vado burning in the street? And how are we going to forget the voice of that infamous priest, saying: This is Padre So-and-So, go throw that man's body in a latrine? What a brute! In other words, trying to hide the crime, the crime that they incited, the crimes which they promoted.<br />
<br />
How are we going to forget the images of priests blessing the barricades of Death, the places of torture, the places where the People's right to move about, to work, to live, the very Right to Life was blocked? And they carried the sacrosanct images of Christ, of Our Mother Mary, and placed them at the roadblocks... What a sacrilege! That is sacrilege, that is desecration, and that is a curse, because that curse falls on the authors, the promoters, the instigators and the leaders of so much crime.<br />
<br />
That's why the pain of those days, not just the pain of one person, of oneself as a sensitive being, it was the pain of so many brothers and sisters who called us, the mothers, and I'm not going to say names, but even mothers of priests, who called us terrified by the noise of the mortars and gunfire and weapons with which they intended to destroy the Nicaraguan people. Ah, but they don't know us!<br />
<br />
The noise of the guns terrified even their own families... How infamous! How infamous!<br />
<br />
There is so much and there is so much more to say and so much to remember, and we will say it some day, we are going to keep on saying it, because we must not forget. But as Christians, as children of God, as believers, as devout faithful, we have the duty to protect peace.<br />
<br />
Christ did not say hate one another. Christ did not say destroy yourselves. Christ did not say live in conflict, wage wars. Christ said: Let us love one another, let us love one another, and Peace I leave with you and Peace I give to you.<br />
<br />
And they make fun, when one talks about peace they mock, because they hate peace. They are like vampires. Peace means starvation for them, the death of their satanic impulses. They are like vampires. To talk of peace is to condemn them. But we are going to say and will continue saying: With Peace We Are Going Forward, in Peace We are Going Forward! Peace is sacred. Don't play with it! Peace is not to be trifled with!<br />
<br />
In Peace and affection, as families, in sister and brotherhood, fraternally, it is that we are Advancing, working with security, stability. A People-President Government supporting initiatives, responsive, responding to needs, despite the aggression of we already know who: The invaders! Those who have always wanted to take over Nicaragua, the same Empires.<br />
<br />
But, here peace is built and here any attempt to destroy that Peace that allows us to make our way, to advance, improve everyone's Life, to prosper is repelled. We have the right to that, and the duty of a Government belonging to the People, the duty is to create the best conditions for Life, so that we remain full of Hope, that we have confidence in the true God of a true God! Not in manipulations... No!<br />
<br />
May we have confidence in God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, and may we chase away, may we continue to chase away the demons, the devils. Go behind us Satan, for here lives Love, Peace, Jesus Christ Our Lord!<br />
<br />
Let's Go Forward, Compañer@s, Always Further On, with Hope and Great Affection! A warm embrace. Thank you.</p>
