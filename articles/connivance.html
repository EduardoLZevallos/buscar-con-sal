      <br>
Routine
self-serving distortion of world events by the corporate and
alternative media exists in symbiosis with a willfully deluded
narrative of Western moral authority and superiority. That narrative
feeds off the systematic hypocrisy and insane vanity of the Western
Bloc political leaders in the countries of North America and Europe and
their Pacific allies. Majority world opinion no longer accepts the
ridiculous pretence to moral leadership of Western politicians. Only
their brutal&nbsp; readiness to use overwhelming military power to get
their
geopolitical way gets them a pseudo-respectful hearing in international
forums.<br>
      <br>
The cases of Libya and Nicaragua, respectively, offer
clear examples of the almost complete collapse of credibility of the
Western Bloc political and media classes. No one familiar with the
systematic, deceitful under-reporting and misreporting of events in
Nicaragua over the last decade will take seriously for a second Western
corporate and much alternative media coverage of events in Libya. As
events unfold, what seems to be happening is that Western media in
general are becoming more and more irrelevant except as propaganda
sources of increasingly absurd false beliefs providing a spurious basis
for imperialist intervention by the Western Bloc powers.<br>
      <br>
The
developing military aggression against Libya confirms the perfidious
folly of Western Bloc neocolonial ambition. The Arab allies of that
aggression are precisely the regional governments responsible for&nbsp;
repressing democracy and human rights in their countries. Libya's
government is one of the few Arab countries that has consistently and
successfully applied a redistributive program to its economy in favour
of the majority of the population. That is one of the reasons for the
minority rebellion against the Libyan government, since at least some
of the rebels seem to represent a clique greedy to get a bigger share
of Libya's wealth for themselves.<br>
      <br>
The Libyan government faces a
rebellion from rebel forces who compensated for their self-evident lack
of popular support with well-prepared armed violence and immediate
calls for foreign intervention. That minority rebellion is supported by
the same anti-democratic Arab regimes who have looked on with approval
at the murderous repression of the Shia majority in Bahrain.&nbsp; It
is
hardly surprising that the much more broadly based African Union has
explicitly opposed the imperialist aggression against Libya now under
way.<br>
      <br>
Similar double standards prevail in Latin America.
President Barack Obama's upcoming visit to Brazil, El Salvador and
Chile is likely to come to symbolize declining US economic and
political influence in that part of the world. The official US
government narrative is that its policies promote prosperity and
democracy in the region. But its key allies have been corrupt,
murderous, narcotics-ridden regimes of dubious legitimacy in Colombia
and Mexico whose social indicators are among the worst in the
hemisphere. Similar double-talk characterizes US and European Union
relations with Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
The case of Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
Misrepresentation
and false reporting of events in Nicaragua is routine in the
international corporate media. Omission of readily available data,
factual errors, deliberate distortion, reliance for information on
unrepresentative cliques, have all helped construct the Western Bloc
media caricature of a country stifled by a corrupt, undemocratic
government. Consistent affirmation of Nicaragua's dramatic social and
economic progress by international organizations from the IMF to UNESCO
to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization to the Panamerican Health
Organization is regularly written out of the media record.<br>
      <br>
Events
in Nicaragua are constantly reported from the point of view of a tiny,
politically irrelevant elite who maintain&nbsp; undue influence by
piggy-backing on right-wing political allies. Leading voices of that
clique include the talented novelists Sergio Ramirez and Gioconda
Belli, discredited former Sandinista leaders like Dora Maria Tellez,
Victor Hugo Tinoco or Monica Baltodano, disingenuous journalists like
Carlos Fernando Chamorro and his brother-in-law the politician Edmundo
Jarquin. Jarquin is&nbsp; now a vice-presidential running mate for
right-wing gerontocrat Fabio Gadea.<br>
      <br>
As the program of the
Nicaraguan government under President Daniel Ortega progresses, the
corporate media caricature looks steadily more demented. Only people
resolutely determined to deny the facts can rationally accept dishonest
news reports on Nicaragua in the supposedly respectable international
media. The same is true of most of the Western Bloc alternative media.
Nor should that fact come as any surprise, given that the consumers of
alternative media in Western Bloc countries share narratives that
largely share parallel assumptions of innate superiority to those of
their mainstream corporate counterparts.<br>
      <br>
In the case of
Nicaragua, the clearest example of that fact was the intervention by
various intellectuals led by Noam Chomsky in support of a hunger strike
by Dora Maria Tellez&nbsp; in 2008 protesting the loss of her party's
legal
standing. The intellectuals called on the Nicaraguan government to
engage in "dialogue" with the country's opposition when the very
opposition they supported were running an odious hate campaign
including barely veiled incitement to assassinate President Daniel
Ortega. Se&ntilde;ora Tellez' protest was in fact part of a murky
political
manouevre to clear the path for a united right-wing candidacy in the
crucial 2008 municipal election in Nicaragua's capital, Managua.<br>
      <br>
Other
leading progressive intellectuals have got things just as wrong as Noam
Chomsky did. For example, James Petras said in 2009, "Nicaragua is
little more than a liberal government in every sense of the word; the
current Sandinista administration has not changed a single one of the
economic policies of previous governments."(Pensar que
Latinoam&eacute;rica
est&aacute; encamin&aacute;ndose hacia la izquierda es una
exageraci&oacute;n triunfalista
poco seria', Entrevista con Marcelo Colussi, Argenpress, 21/05/2008).<br>
      <br>
Likewise,
respected progressive economist Eric Toussaint describes Nicaragua as
being among "the supposed 'left wing' governments that carry out a
neoliberal policy and support the national or regional bourgeoisie in
their projects" including among these the governments of "Brazil,
Uruguay, Chile and the government of Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez Kirchner
of the
Argentinean peronists. They are governments that favour big capital,
dolled up with a few measures of social welfare. In effect, they gild
the neoliberal medicine with social programmes." (La izquierda llega al
gobierno pero no tiene el poder, Eric Toussaint, Rebeli&oacute;n,
21-04-2009)<br>
      <br>
The
absurdity of those positions taken by leading progressive intellectuals
is self evident from even a superficial familiarity with the Nicaraguan
government's programme since January 2007 which from the start has
radically prioritized Nicaragua's impoverished majority. Successively,
in January 2007, the Nicaraguan government cut the salaries of
ministers and senior government officials by over 50%, joined the Cuban
and Venezuelan led ALBA trade and development cooperation bloc,&nbsp;
and
reinstated free medical care and schooling, rights severely eroded over
the previous 17 years of right wing neoliberal governments.<br>
      <br>
Subsequently,
from 2007 to 2009 the government has prioritized a radical investment
program to promote small and medium sized agriculture. Nicaragua can
reasonably expect to be self-sufficient in food production by 2015.
That policy goes directly against conventional neoliberal wisdom which
argues for small countries to satisfy food needs by importing food from
rich country surpluses. <br>
      <br>
The government's physical
infrastructure policy similarly goes entirely contrary to grand
neoliberal schemes like those originally formulated in the Plan Puebla
Panama framework. Those plans prioritised big business needs and
projected ambitious road communications running North-South and
East-West across Central America. The Sandinista government by contrast
has prioritized local road building programs to benefit local business
and in particular the country's agricultural sector. Infrastructure
investment has also prioritized small port facilities to support local
fishermen and increase transport options for remote communities.<br>
      <br>
To
cope with persistent price inflation in food and energy prices, the
Nicaraguan government operates a system of subsidised food outlets
offering basic foods at well below market prices. Urban&nbsp; bus
transport
in Managua has been subsidised since 2007. Interurban public transport
and taxi cooperatives throughout the country benefit from subsidies
both for fuel and for tyres and vehicle parts. The overall result has
been to hold down prices both for ordinary transport users and for
small businesses. This month the government announced that it would
increase the subsidy available to keep electricity prices from rising
throughout 2011.<br>
      <br>
At the end of 2006 the country's electricity
generating capacity had collapsed, barely meeting 80% of national
demand - which stood then at a little over 500 megawatts - and causing
daily power cuts for a much as 12 hours at a time. Within 6 months the
government had eliminated those power cuts. By the end of 2010 with
funding from ALBA, bilateral development cooperation agreements, loans
from various development banks and relatively small private sector
investment, the country had installed generating capacity of almost
1000 megawatts. <br>
      <br>
By 2015, the country aims to have reduced its
dependence on oil fuel powered generating stations by 50% by
promoting&nbsp;
solar, wind, biomass, geothermal and hydroelectric power. By 2017 the
country may well be self-sufficient in its electricity generating
capacity. That massive effort to transform the country's energy matrix
is unprecedented in the region and seemed unimaginable in 2006.<br>
      <br>
Even
this brief summary of key policies implemented by the Nicaraguan
government makes the remarks made by Eric Toussaint and James Petras
look completely foolish. It is long past time for the Western Bloc
country intellectual managers who tend to control the production of
news and information about international affairs to admit they have
been hopelessly wrong about events in Nicaragua. They are unlikely to
do so because they tend to share a similar neocolonial mindset to their
counterparts in Western Bloc governments. The truth of that is very
clear from Western analysis and coverage of events in Libya. <br>
      <br>
The propaganda onslaught against Libya <br>
      <br>
It
seems undeniable now that events in Libya have served mainly to provide
a mirror for observers in which to make out whatever image they choose
to see. Concrete information has been very hard to get. Lies and
rumours have been treated as facts. Inconvenient facts have been
omitted and concealed.<br>
      <br>
Hardly anyone in the Western Bloc
propaganda media reported the lynchings and attacks against black
Africans in the parts of Libya controlled by the monarchist rebels and
their ad hoc salafist allies. But reports by Turkish and Somali people
who have left Libya confirm that the rebels have murdered at least one
hundred Africans in Libya while many thousands have suffered
ill-treatment and abuse at the rebels' hands.<br>
      <br>
Now the first
black President of the United States has authorized US military attacks
in support of groups of murderous racists and numerous salafist
fighters who sympathise with Osama bin Laden. It remains to be seen how
many innocent Libyan civilians will be blown to bits by Western Bloc
bombing supposedly carried out to prevent the bombing of innocent
Libyan civilians. <br>
      <br>
Almost all progressive opinion in the
Western Bloc countries has applauded the rebels without having the
least idea what those rebels stand for or the prosperity that people in
Libya have experienced over the last few years. Much progressive
opinion has ended up on the same side as the same repressive Arab
regimes that Western progressives allege they oppose. The opinion of
the African Union has been largely ignored. Nor have many advocates of
intervention paused to consider what might happen to women in Libya
should a reactionary Islamic regime take power following the current
Western Bloc miltiary intervention.<br>
      <br>
In particular in their
coverage of Libya, the Western Bloc corporate media have shown more
clearly than ever that they are merely propaganda outlets for their
respective governments. Likewise, highly regarded writers like Robert
Fisk, Pepe Escobar and Rene Naba have pushed their own propaganda
narrative demonizing the Libyan government without providing relevant
context or offering an honest account of conditions in Libya for the
country's people. The contradictions and hypocrisies thrown up by
Western and Arab responses to events in Libya are obvious. Action is
demanded in Libya but not in Bahrain, or the Ivory Coast, or Gaza, or
Western Sahara. Western and Arab cynicism is complete.<br>
      <br>
The response of the ALBA countries<br>
      <br>
By
contrast the ALBA countries have taken a very similar line to that of
the African Union. Led by Cuba and Venezuela, the ALBA countries
(including Nicaragua, Bolivia, Ecuador, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica
and St Vincent and the Grenadines) have insisted on fundamental
principles of international law, non-aggression, territorial integrity
and self determination. They too have called for a peaceful solution to
the crisis respecting the basic rights of people in Libya.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's
statement to the UN on Libya was typical : "Nicaragua is enormously
concerned at the loss of human life, of innocent civilians and in this
case we deeply regret the loss of life in Libya, a country with which
Nicaragua has maintained close relations. We trust in the capacity and
wisdom of the Libyan people and their leadership, headed by&nbsp;
Muammar
Ghadaffi, to resolve their internal problems and find a peaceful
solution in a sovereign way without interference or foreign military
intervention, of any kind under any justification."<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On March
4th ALBA made a declaration proposing an international commission to
mediate between the two sides and carry out humanitarian action to end
the situation of civil war in the country. The ALBA proposal was
received positively at the time by the Libyan government, by the Arab
League and, with some reservations, by Russia. Once the Libyan
government began to defeat the rebels, the Arab League then began
calling for foreign military intervention.<br>
      <br>
The day before the
decision of the United Nations to expel Libya from the UN Human Rights
Council, 65 civilians in Afghanistan were killed in bombing by NATO
warplanes. A little earlier, 9 Afghan children were killed by NATO
missiles. No NATO member of the UN Human Rights Council will be
expelled either for those massacres or for the carnage of over a
million Iraqi civilians dead and wounded by US and allied forces. Nor
will any NATO country ever be subject to sanctions for these and
innumerable other crimes committed in the name of democracy and
civilization over the last few decades.<br>
      <br>
Progressive people in
North America and Europe have never - with the possible exception
of&nbsp;
the French suitcase carriers for the Algerian FLN - directly and
unconditionally helped peoples struggling for liberation. They have
always offered their solidarity conditioned by their own priorities and
criteria. Progressive people in the Western Bloc countries often seem
more afraid of political power in majority world countries than of the
deeply corrupt elites that have betrayed their own societies to years
of lower living standards and cuts in public spending in health care
and education..<br>
      <br>
Those elites persist in massacring and starving
the rest of humanity while steadily turning the screw harder and harder
on their own peoples. Even so, progressive people in the Western Bloc
countries have facilitated a democracy and human rights alibi for the
rich country onslaught against Libya. It is only a matter of time
before people in the majority world remind themselves that Frantz Fanon
had it right. The self-serving cant of people in North America and
Europe connives with the sadistic application of indiscriminate
violence by those regions' governments.<br>
