<p><em><strong>Managua, November 8, 2018</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Towards the 15th anniversary of the Alliance Foundation</strong></em></p>

<p>The Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Heads of Delegations of the member countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-Treaty of Trade of the Peoples (ALBA-TCP), meeting in Managua, on the occasion of its XVII Political Council:</p>

<p>We reiterate the commitment of the countries of the ALBA-TCP to advance the Latin American and Caribbean unity, in the search of a proper, independent and sovereign destiny, for what we will continue working for the regional integration, to guarantee the sovereignty, independence, equality and self-determination of our peoples.</p>

<p>We reaffirm the need to strengthen unity in the diversity of our region, through political consensus and integration, as well as the defense of our sovereignty and self-determination, based on the principles of the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace approved at the II Summit of CELAC, on January 29, 2014, in Havana.</p>

<p>We express our concern about the most recent announcements about the increase of the presence and cooperation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with some countries of our Latin America and the Caribbean, which poses a potential threat to the peace and security in the region.</p>

<p>We denounce the current imperial strategy of undermining against Latin American and Caribbean integration processes, which are beneficial to the Empire and the historical enemies of Latin American and Caribbean integration.</p>

<p>We recognize the strategic value of the foundational ideas of ALBA-TCP in the creation of regional integration mechanisms that have favored the socio-economic development of the countries, the strengthening of the States and their political independence, such as the Petrocaribe Energy Cooperation Agreement that was conceived under the same principles of solidarity, complementarity and sovereignty, traced as ideological and political sustenance Our American and Caribbean vision.</p>

<p>We salute the Banco del Alba, for celebrating on November 5, 2018, the 10th Anniversary of the entry into force of the Agreement Establishing of this multi-state financial institution, conceived in the light of the urgency of the integration of our peoples and with the mandate of be part of the new financial architecture for financing and development of the region.</p>

<p>We congratulate ourselves for the positive results shown on the occasion of this 10th Anniversary, after having reached its breakeven point since 2016, and after having achieved its first capitalization of dividends in 2018.</p>

<p>We recognize the importance and the impact that the Alba-Caribbean region has had financing, equivalent to U$420 million dollars that during these ten years have favored a large group of development projects of great benefit to our people.</p>

<p>We urge the governments of Latin America and the Caribbean to consolidate any advances in the progress that our region has achieved in the last decades in the matter of integration. The strengthening of regional solidarity is the best response to threats of an interventionist nature against the sovereignty of our peoples.</p>

<p>We demand compliance with the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations and International Law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the prohibition of the use and threat of the use of force, respect for self-determination and sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of each country.</p>

<p>We note with concern how the United States government reports migrants as criminals, especially those from Latin America and the Caribbean, through the construction of walls on the border and intimidating by sending public forces to the border. The ALBA-TCP reminds - to the current government of the United States - the significant contributions that the migrants of our region give to the American society.</p>

<p>We condemn the systematic violation of Human Rights that the government of the United States of America continues to carry out by separating and stopping immigrant children on the border.</p>

<p>We promote the universal principles of non-discrimination based on nationality, race, gender or social condition, which promote irrational supremacy and nationalism, such as those that are an encouraged and disparagingly expressed by other countries towards our Latin American and Caribbean brothers.</p>

<p>We alert the international community about the advance of the extreme right-wing at international level, and especially in Our America; it could mean the strengthening of the offensive of aggression against the progressive peoples and governments of the region. The ALBA-TCP will be attentive to the defense of the peoples of our region.</p>

<p>We declare that our alliance today has more validate than ever before, we have been strengthened consequent upon the most recent attacks of the Empire and its allies. Far from subduing us, they strengthen us and encourage us to continue fighting in the name of the dignity of our peoples.</p>

<p>We support people from Nicaragua, who has resisted the imperial strategy of destabilization, with gallantry and heroism. The Nicaraguan people have given a lesson of dignity and resistance to the enemies of the progressive governments with the support of the free peoples of the world.</p>

<p>We distinguish that the brave people of Sandino will not bow to the interventionist actions against its independence and sovereignty and will not fear the constant threats through extraterritorial laws projects, by the United States, whose objective is the economic aggression.</p>

<p>We reiterate our unconditional support to the Nicaraguan Government and the people who have demonstrated their deep commitment to peace, with the development of policies of national unity through a respectful and inclusive dialogue, and that constitute an example of firmness and struggle for the full exercise of its sovereignty.</p>

<p>We express our full support to the government and people of Venezuela, a country that continues to resist the economic and financial siege that prevents it from acquiring food and medicine for its people. The unilateral sanctions that the United States; the European Union and Canada have imposed on the Venezuelan people, they have strengthened the Bolivarian Revolution and its people. Venezuela will continue worthily resisting and defeating the Empire and its allies.</p>

<p>We ratify our committed support to the people and government of Bolivia in its historic and just right to access to the sea with sovereignty. We urge Chile and Bolivia to restart the dialogue and exchange within the framework of the ruling of the International Court of Justice, with the purpose of resolving Bolivia's confinement.</p>

<p>We reject with force the measures adopted against the Caribbean countries, considering them non-cooperative jurisdictions, which joins their unjustified declaration as middle-income countries, all of which causes serious damage to their economies.</p>

<p>We reiterate the international community's demand that the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States on Cuba be lifted unconditionally, that it affects the Cuban people and that, due to its extraterritoriality, it affects all States. We welcome the recent approval in the General Assembly of the United Nations, for XXVII occasion of the Resolution that demands the end of the blockade and the success of the Cuban people by defeating the maneuvers of the United States to denaturalize it.</p>

<p>We denounce the attempts of the United States Government’s Administration to revive the unfortunate Monroe Doctrine, unacceptable political justification of interventionism and imperialist domination in our region.</p>

<p>We reject the systematic and interventionist actions of the Secretary General of the OAS and some countries that pretend to attack the sovereignty, self-determination and constitutional order of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and other countries in which their people have decided to govern themselves without tutelage of any kind, which would result in the destabilization of the region.</p>

<p>We promote the construction of a new international order, fair and inclusive, where there are no empires or hegemonies and relations between States are based on respect for the people and institutions chosen by them and the diverse cultures that coexist in the world.</p>

<p>We confirm our will to continue working and cooperating in the fight against climate change and natural disasters, a phenomenon that is the product of the irrational capitalist system that assaults our mother earth and that increases the frequency and intensity of natural phenomena that cause regrettable human and material losses.</p>

<p>We highlight the fact that developing countries are those that suffer most from the adverse effects of climate change and natural disasters, with a very strong impact on the most vulnerable sectors. The ALBA-TCP calls upon the international community to respect the commitments assumed internationally to stop global warming and work towards the achievement of sustainable development in harmony with nature.</p>

<p>We assume the decision to strengthen the institutional and operational structure of ALBA-TCP and to continue advancing in the work of the Ministerial Councils and the Executive Secretariat.</p>

<p>We thank the brother people of El Salvador for their efforts and struggles in favor of the development and strengthening of CELAC, and also express to the brother people of Bolivia all our support in their exercise of the Pro Tempore Presidency of CELAC in 2019.</p>

<p>We express that ALBA has shown that another world is possible on the basis of union, trust, respect among people, through educational, cultural, social and economic missions, among other initiatives.</p>

<p>We will meet in Havana, Cuba, next December 14th, on the occasion of the Fourteenth Anniversary of the Alliance to celebrate the XVI Summit of Heads of State and Government of ALBA-TCP.</p>

<p>We remember and make our own the words of the Sandinista leader Carlos Fonseca Amador, who said that "A revolutionary knows that wherever he is, as long as he fights for humanity, he will be fulfilling his duty".</p>
