in the Midday Edition of Multinoticias on Channel 4<br />
<br />
April 23rd 2025</strong></em></h3>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="300" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario75.jpg.html" width="450" /></p>

<p>A very good afternoon, Compañera. Really, a very good afternoon and very Good Times also, through which, thanks to the Heavenly Father, we are living: Times of Peace, Times of Affection, Times of Brother and Sisterhood, Times of Solidarity, Times in which to get to know each other, recognizing each other as complementary, complementing each other along the Ways of Peace and the Well-being of Nicaragua’s Families.</p>

<p>And well, yesterday we set out walking for Peace, yesterday we reasserted that Commitment of Nicaraguan Hearts, of the Souls of all who live in Nicaragua. A clear, forceful commitment to Peace, because we know that, without Peace, there is nothing. Because we see, conceive and consider Peace as an inescapable Commitment of Humanity and in the case of us as Nicaraguans, for ourselves and for the Sake of Everyone.</p>

<p>Without Peace, there is nothing, and the Opinion Survey circulated today by M&amp;R, presented today by M&amp;R, clearly says so: 99.4% of Nicaraguans say that under no circumstances should Peace, Economic and Social Stability be put at risk.</p>

<p>Those who wanted but could not, those who Could Not Prevail, Will They, however much they want to, they will not be able. Because, with Hatred and with Evil, Never Again...! With Perversion, Never Again!</p>

<p>We know how to value Peace, we have suffered greatly the adversities generated by hatred, by the curse of greed, selfishness, servility, lackeyism, surrendering and selling out, we have suffered a lot and that's why we know that defending Peace is not just our Duty, our Responsibility, but our Honor too. It is our Honor being Committed, as a People of Glorious History, of immense Courage... As God's people!</p>

<p>And I draw attention to all the opinions expressed in this Survey presented today by M&amp;R, where the population says: In Nicaragua, 98.1% of people say “we breathe Peace”.</p>

<p>In addition, people embrace Socialist Ideals and Christian Values, Christian Values together with Socialist Ideals and Practical Solidarity. We want to live in Independence, with Security. Peace as the basis of everything. Sovereignty, Independence, Security and Prosperity for all Nicaraguan Families is our Right, and it is our duty to seek it and to defend it.</p>

<p>Interesting this Study that has circulated through the Media, where the People express themselves, and express themselves on all issues, a very complete Study that evaluates all aspects: Security and Security Institutions, also the Struggle for National Unity.</p>

<p>89.5% in total agreement with the Unity of Everyone, for the Sake of Everyone, defeating Poverty, working together to defeat Poverty. And 81.7% of our people speak out in support of the direction in which Comandante Daniel is leading the Country. They approve the Management of our Comandante in 85.3%.</p>

<p>We live with hope...! This Model of Government of the People-President generates Hope in 85.8% of our People.</p>

<p>92.3%, Optimism. And 94% also view the construction of a Canal through Nicaragua with positive approval.</p>

<p>Only 15% of the respondents are thinking about emigrating.</p>

<p>This is a very important survey, an expression of the Opinions of our People, in these days when we celebrate all that we have achieved, that we have been achieving, all that we have been achieving and that we are going to continue achieving, by the Hand of God, so as to eradicate Evil, Hatred... That Hatred of theirs! They raged against everything Good, they raged and destroyed, they torched, burned and bound and tortured, exhibiting all their viciousness; they burned Brothers and Sisters alive.</p>

<p>Those, those are the ones on the other side of the world where, thank God, they are now, those are the ones who say they want the best for Nicaragua... Those same ones, those who burned our Brothers alive, those who destroyed, those who tied, tortured, and "tinted", a popular word, painting People, in hateful, inhuman, offensive practices, typical of the Heralds of Evil... Of the very Heralds of Evil! Diabolical practices, satanic practices, and we now know who was leading it all.</p>

<p>We know now..! They had their day. They Couldn’t Prevail Nor Will They, we say so every day with the certainty of a Peace-loving People who treasure Peace, a Noble People, a People of History, of Historical Courage. That is why we say, Honor and Glory to the Nicaraguan People, since at all times in our history we have been able to defend our National Dignity, with Pride, with Certainty. Because we are building, through History, a Future of National Pride, Pride in the sense of feeling a glorious and honorable appropriation of who we are.</p>

<p>That is our Pride: To be Nicaraguans, to recognize ourselves as Nicaraguans, to love our Sacred Territory; to love one another, as Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace, of Love, of Goodness, preached... To love one another, and that is not only our Heritage, our Pride, our Sense of National Dignity, but our Legacy and our Path to the Future, which we are building around the Good of Everyone.</p>

<p>And thank God also, since with this Peace we can fully ensure the Payment of all Salaries to Public Servants. That is to say, on Tuesday, April 29th everyone will be paid.</p>

<p>And precisely on April 30th we will be celebrating in a big way, God Willing, not only the Times of Peace, but also the Pride of a Working People, here we are all Workers, a People of Honor who can say of itself: “Work is our Laurel of Dignity”.</p>

<p>On April 30th commemorating Comandante Tomás, commemorating Labor Day and the Workers that all of us are, and celebrating these Times of Peace. Thanking God, because we are able to comprehend and take responsibility for the protection, the defense of our Foremost Blessing, which is Peace.</p>

<p>- o0o-</p>

<p>In Matagalpa, all over the country we marched yesterday, with so much Joy, so much Pride and so much dignity, beyond the Courage and the Pain from the memories of those terrible days, those days of Hell, when the devils wanted to fill our Nicaragua with flames. They were able to fill it for a few moments, but we doused them out, and we saw them off as well.</p>

<p>And their loud voices, full of hatred, cursing their own People. Just imagine what kind of condemnation: To curse their own Brothers and Sisters, to curse and wish evil on their own Brothers and Sisters while feigning good intentions... What good intentions? As we said, it can never be good to torture Human Beings, who are also our Brothers and Sisters.</p>

<p>It can never be good to burn down all those facilities representing Progress, to threaten to burn down a warehouse full of medical supplies destined for the entire country. Can that be for people’s good? What kind of love is that? So how can that be Christianity? Hypocrites! Such Hypocrites!</p>

<p>Now all those who persecuted our true Faith, now they declare themselves “defenders of the Christian Faith”. When have they ever been such...? When instead they mocked our Religious Traditions, our Rites. It's the truth, that is the truth, and now they appear claiming to defend the Faith.</p>

<p>Opportunists...! Fakers! They won't be back...! And we say to them clearly. You Couldn't Prevail, Nor Will You! Jesus reigns here forever, and Love reigns!</p>
