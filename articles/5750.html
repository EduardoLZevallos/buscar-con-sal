<p>We thank you for joining us on this Twenty-Seventh University of Police Sciences “Leonel Rugama" “Surrender your mother!”, dedicated to the legacy of Comandante Eduardo Contreras Escobar "Marcos" who joined the Sandinista National Liberation Front at a very young age. Comandante Eduardo Contreras Escobar, was Head of the Guerrilla Commando "Juan José Quezada”, which, on December 27th 1974, stormed the house of the Somoza Minister Chema Castillo, a historic operation of the FSLN, that broke with the stage of silent accumulation of forces. This action resulted in the release of prominent Sandinista militants and Members of the FSLN's Historic National Directorate, including Comandante President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and José Benito Escobar.</p>

<p>The police officers graduated in this promotion honor his legacy and make his feelings our own, when he said: ”We Nicaraguans can now look anyone in the face, because now we can proudly say that we are fighting imperialism with weapons in hand, thus helping achieve the final liberation of all the Peoples of Latin America." Eduardo Contreras Escobar</p>

<p>To refer to Comandante Eduardo Contreras Escobar, "Marcos", is to speak of Revolutionary Love, of the Just Cause, he bequeathed us his heroism, his Sandinista firmness, anti-imperialism and his loyalty to the Sandinista National Liberation Front. The motto of the Commando "Juan José Quezada" was: All orders will be fulfilled except one: surrender. A Free Nation or Death!</p>

<p>In this Twenty-Seventh Graduation of Cadets, 33 Compañeros and Compañeras join the police family at the service of our people (9 compañeras and 24 compañeros), assuminf the commitment to defend Peace, protect the Life and Physical Integrity of Individuals, families and communities. Of these, 25 completed their studies at the “Leonel Rugama” University of Police Sciences and 8 at Universities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, also 9 Compañeras are part of this promotion, Worthy representatives of Nicaraguan women, of our Women Police Officers.</p>

<p>The training of the graduates of the Bachelor's Degree in Police Sciences, from 2021 to 2024, was focused on the topics of Crime Prevention, Investigation of Common and Organized Crime, Traffic Accidents, Criminology, Police Intervention Techniques, Human Talent Management, Material and Technological Resources.</p>

<p>They were trained in the revolutionary principles and the legacy of our Heroes and Martyrs, prepared to give their Lives out of Love for this Blessed, Forever Free Nicaragua and committed to defending Peace and Prosperity.</p>

<p>Beloved Graduates, we will continue to work in coordination, articulation and communication with the Institutions of our Good Government, Municipal Authorities, Political Secretaries and the territorial structure of the FSLN, so that Nicaragua continues to be one of the safest countries in Central and Latin America.</p>

<p>You gave your best effort during these 4 years of studies, which have concluded with discipline. In this Promotion we offer recognition to the Graduates deserving of the Titles and Degrees they hold today; we recognize those who obtained the best grades:</p>

<p><b>Address by Daniel</b></p>

<p>Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, Families of these Lands, of these Heroic Peoples, who have always fought for the Sovereignty of the Nation, for Peace.</p>

<p>Compañera Rosario Murillo Zambrana, Vice President of the Republic of Nicaragua; First Commissioner Francisco Javier Díez Madriz, Director General of the National Police; Army General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Comandante-in-Chief of our Nicaraguan Army; Commissioner General Horacio Sebastián Rocha López, Minister of Public Security; Compañera María Amelia Coronel Kinloch, Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p>Commissioner General Zhukov Serrano Pérez, Deputy Director General of the National Police; Major General Bayardo Ramón Rodríguez Ruiz, Chief of the General Staff of the Nicaraguan Army; Major General Marvin Elías Corrales Rodríguez, Inspector General of the Nicaraguan Army; Commissioner General Zaida Matilde Pineda Arauz, Rector of the Leonel Rugama University of Police Sciences, with the motto: “Surrender your mother!”</p>

<p>Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, Nicaraguan families, Families of these Young People who are graduating today, who accompany us here and who also preside over this Event, honoring us with their presence. They come from some of the most distant places in our country; others will be from places not so distant.</p>

<p>The Compañera Leading Student is from Río San Juan, she comes from those Heroic Lands, where they fought in the Insurrection, in the month of October, in the Insurrectional October Offensive, when the columns of the Sandinista Front managed to take the main city of that Municipality, of that Department, San Carlos. The National Guad garrison there was well prepared, having combat units trained by the Yankees, and they were alert because we were already entering the Final Offensive, which would lead us to Victory in a short time. So also, on a day like today, in the battles that were being waged in the years leading up to the Victory of July 19, in 1976, in the Department of Matagalpa, in the mountains of Matagalpa, a Heroic Compañera, Adelaida García, originally from the Cerro Colorado Community, in the Municipality of Matiguás, fell in combat. That was a guerrilla zone, a combat zone, of the Sandinista Front.</p>

<p>And also in 1978, on a day like today, the combat took place there in Peñas Blancas, where there was a combat in which the National Guard was accompanied by their aviation, with mortars, and the guerrilla units first with their rifles, later the mortars would arrive, then even artillery would arrive, thanks to the solidarity of Comandante Fidel Castro.</p>

<p>And indeed, in combat on that day, in the month of December, on December 16th, the Combat Unit of the Sandinista Front in action was the Benjamín Zeledón Combat Unit, that was the name of the Combat Unit.</p>

<p>And the combat, as I was telling you, was there on the border, near the River El Naranjo and near the town of Los Mojones in Rivas, and of course, Somoza Guards fell, and our Sandinista compañeros and compañeras also fell, including compañeros Roberto Lara Pineda, Ariel Sánchez, Danilo Ponce, José Francisco Gaitán Muñoz and Ramón Escobar.</p>

<p>There too fell compañeros originally from Panama and other compañeros and compañeras originally from South America, because there were many Internationalist fighters on the Southern Front.</p>

<p>And today we salute the Supreme High Command of the Nicaraguan Army, the Ministry of the Interior, the National Police; the Members of the Government Cabinet, the National Council of Universities, the National Evaluation and Accreditation Council; the Compañera Mayor of Managua; the Naval, Air and Police Military Attaches who are accompanying us; the Professors, Students, Cadets, of the University of Police Sciences, and we have already greeted the relatives who are here presiding over this Event.</p>

<p>We also greet the Brothers and Sisters who are the Combatants of the Volunteer Units of the National Police.</p>

<p>Here before the People of Nicaragua, before the Civil and Military Authorities, before the Families present, we are going to proceed to swear in these Compañeros and Compañeras who come from the People, their Roots are in the People, and now as Graduates they have become Police Officers to serve the People.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/412756.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p>And thus the Great Unity decisive for the defense of Peace is being consolidated; both the Police and the Army come from the People, these are their Roots, and thus, the Battle for Peace is being waged by All of Us Together, the Army, the Police, and the People... The People, who are organized neither in the Army nor in the Police, are a determining force to defend peace.</p>

<p>And so, at the head of their fellow Graduates are Compañera Inspector Ledys Imara Maradiaga Mejía, originally from the Department of Río San Juan; Inspector Stiven Amaro Orosco Cano, originally from the Lands where our General Sandino was born; Inspector Alexis Alfredo Rocha Suárez, originally from the Land where a Comandante was born, one of the Founders of the Sandinista Front, a place where many Heroic Combatants were also born, but who were killed by the National Guard, such as Cornelio Silva Argüello.</p>

<p>We also have another compañero here, another young graduate, Alberth Josué Hernández Latino, also from the lands of our General Sandino. You know, we are talking about the Department of Masaya, where Niquinohomo lies, where our General was born, and another one who was born in Nandasmo, someone born in another Municipality of the Department of Masaya, born in the Lands of our General Sandino.</p>

<p>Inspector Alexandra Gabriela Brizuela Funez, originally from the Department of Madriz; Inspector Anielka María Acevedo Urbina, originally from the Department of Jinotega... Jinotega, which immediately calls to mind Zeledón, General Benjamín Zeledón was born there; Inspector Anthony Aldahir Flores Dávila, originally from the Autonomous Region of the Southern Caribbean Coast. The Coast, the Peoples of the Caribbean showing proof and example of their commitment to Peace, incorporated into the National Police, just as they are also integrated into the Nicaraguan Army.</p>

<p>Inspector César Alexander Torres Hernández, originally from the Department of León... León, of Rigoberto Lopez Perez! León, where Rubén Darío lies! Inspector Dominic Leonel Medina Reyes, originally from the Department of Carazo.</p>

<p>Heroes and Martyrs have multiplied in every department of the country, because throughout history, in all the battles fought against foreign invaders, from the Resistance of the Indigenous Peoples against the Spanish, the Resistance of the Nicaraguan People against Yankee expansionism that was headed by William Walker. There is Struggle!</p>

<p>Later Zeledón, then Sandino, and thus the Struggle goes. There has not been a day when Nicaragua is not fighting for Sovereignty, for Peace, and how much it has cost! It has cost the lives of thousands of Heroes and thousands of Martyrs, across the length and breadth of our Country.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned Inspector Dervis Zamora; Inspector José Porfirio Ramírez Sánchez, also from Masaya; Inspector July Nathalia García Esquivel, from the Chinandega Department; Inspector Kevin Jhoel Reyes Lira, from the Autonomous Region of the North Caribbean Coast, there by for Bilwi, by the Coco River.</p>

<p>Inspector Keyser Mojamet Lacayo Molina, originally from the Autonomous Region of the North Caribbean Coast as well. There are villages along the Plain, along the Coast, along the Coco River, there are many communities there too.</p>

<p>Inspector Lesther Emir García López, originally from the Department of Nueva Segovia; Inspector Marcio Alexander Ruiz Pavón, originally from the Department of Masaya; Inspector Marcos Antonio González Altamirano, from the Department of Jinotega.</p>

<p>Lieutenant María Elena Rivera Suárez, from the Department of Managua; Inspector Maricela Lucía López Conto, originally from the Department of Masaya; Inspector Maynor Manuel García Guzmán, originally from the Department of Carazo; Captain Meyling de los Ángeles Montoya, originally from the Department of León.</p>

<p>Inspector Oneyser Enoc López Sánchez, originally from the Department of Madriz; Lieutenant Pablo Efrén Cárdenas Melgara, originally from the Department of Madriz; Lieutenant Roberto José García Flores, originally from the Department of Managua.</p>

<p>Inspector Samira Samantha Osorno Suazo, originally from the Autonomous Region of the North Caribbean Coast; Captain Santos Augusto Ruiz Flores, originally from the Department of Managua; Captain Sergio Antonio Blas Ramirez, originally from the Department of Masaya.</p>

<p>Inspector Wilfredo Eloy Carrasco Carrasco, originally from the Department of Estelí, and Captain Yaneth del Carmen Fonseca Rojas, originally from the Department of Managua.I'm going to ask for clarification here. Most of the graduates are Inspectors, but to my surprise I see we have Captains.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/412770.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p><b>Words of First Commissioner Francisco Díaz</b></p>

<p>Those are the ones who were in the Russian Federation.</p>

<p><b>Words of Daniel</b></p>

<p>Oh, it's just that this can create confusion. For both the Army and the Police, when they graduate, the Graduates do so as Lieutenants, even, and here suddenly I see Captains appearing. They come with that rank because these four compañeros, Captain Meiling from Los Angeles Montoya, from Leon... Where's Meiling? Can you come closer, Compañero? So you did your studies in the Russian Federation? How long were you studying? 6 years! And here it's four years, there it's six years, that explains why you come with the rank of Captain.</p>

<p>Then too we have Inspectors. Here we have one who already has the Rank of Lieutenant as well, he is Pablo Efrén Cárdenas Melgara, from Madriz. He also studied in Russia, but at another School, because they come one rank lower than the Classmate who studied 6 years. Then there is another Lieutenant, Roberto José García Flores. Come closer, Compañero. Which school did you study at in Russia? You studied for five years, so you were with the compañero who also has the rank of Lieutenant. The Companero who was there for six years, that explains why he comes with the Rank of Captain and you come with the Rank of Lieutenant. We're getting that clear now.</p>

<p>So then we have also another Captain, who is Santos Augusto Ruiz Flores. And we are clear now that the reason those have the rank of Captain is because they studied six years there in Russia.</p>

<p>Then we have another Captain, Sergio Antonio Blas Ramirez, from the Department of Masaya. And another Captain, Janeth del Carmen Fonseca Rojas. Where is Janeth del Carmen Fonseca Rojas? Come closer, Compañera. That now makes two Female Captains here. So you were in Russia for 6 years. Congratulations! It is that they had a high level of performance, because the schools there are very demanding.</p>

<p>So, we discovered the mystery, because I was reading and asking myself, but how does this work? I was suddenly seeing Captains and Lieutenants.</p>

<p>We are going to make the Promise of Law.</p>

<p>Do you promise, before God, before the Nation, before the Nicaraguan People and Families, before our Heroes and Martyrs, to respect the Constitution, the Laws, the Rights and Freedoms of the People, and faithfully fulfill the Missions entrusted, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Action of the National Police, to defend the Peace, Security and Stability of our Nation, under the Motto of: Honor, Security, Service?</p>

<p><b>Cadets</b></p>

<p>Yes, I promise!</p>

<p><b>Words of Daniel</b></p>

<p>If you do so, let the Country and the People recognize it; if not, let them indict you.</p>

<p>Long live the National Police!</p>

<p>Viva, Viva, Viva!</p>

<p>Long live the Volunteer Police!</p>

<p>Viva, Viva, Viva!</p>

<p>Long live the graduates of this afternoon! And our Embrace, our Love, our Affection, for the Families who have accompanied them throughout these years and who are a vital part of this great step they are taking at this moment.</p>

<p>Long live Nicaragua, Blessed and Forever Free!</p>

<p>Long Live Nicaragua, Christian, Socialist and in Solidarity!</p>

<p>Long live peace!</p>

<p>Long live peace!</p>

<p>Long live peace!<br />

<h3><em><strong>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua, after the XXVII Graduation<br />
of Cadets from the Leonel Rugama National Police Academy “Surrender your mother!”</strong></em></h3>

<h3><em><strong>December 16th 2024</strong></em></h3>

<p>A very good evening, and very good evening too, Beloved Families of our Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Today we are here with these Young Women and Men, who are completing a stage of training, learning, of gathering Knowledge so as to apply that Knowledge, all the while working for the Security of our Families, the Security of our Youth, the Security of Nicaragua's People, which is the priority.</p>

<p>For us to live securely is to live in Peace. To live in Peace is to live in calm and security. And so this Month of December is especially beautiful, not only for all that we celebrate as Christians, as the People of God, but also for all these Graduations and Promotions, be it from Preschool or High School, in Universities, in Technical Schools, or in the Army and Police Academies of Police Sciences or Military Sciences, leading us not only to think, but to assure us all of the certainty that We are Moving Forward and that Education is a Priority, precisely so as to prepare ourselves, to be able to serve better, and to better realize ourselves as Human Beings.</p>

<p>Because the fulfillment of each one of us depends on how we feel integrated into the Community, into Society, in this Country that we love so much. Integrating so as to move onward! That is why I say that all these learning processes are a significant advance.</p>

<p>And today I was also watching on Russian Federation television a very beautiful report about the Universities in our Countryside, I always insist: the Universities, the Culture Centers, the Trade Schools, everything that we are managing to carry forward , is because we have Peace...! Universities, Technical Schools, Technical Centers, Centers for the Development of all our faculties, all our capabilities.</p>

<p>And this is possible because we have Peace, and because Nicaragua's Families are full of confidence, grateful to the Heavenly Father and with full confidence that We Are Going Forward United. That is why we want to learn, that is why we want to work more and more, that is why our Vocation to make progress becomes a reality every day at all these levels, in all these spaces where we are realizing ourselves as the People of God.</p>

<p>This is a Month for celebrating that we are one Big Family, a Month to tell us, each one of us, that we are consolidating the Future of Everyone in our Homes and our Families where, because we hold to our Values, there is our Heroism, there is our Strength, there is our Spirit, in our Homes, with our Families.</p>

<p>From there we set out every day on the path of advancement in our Blessed Nicaragua, from our Values; our Ideals and our Values, because we have faith, and also, because every Dawn also represents, for all of us, the Sun, that Sun which illuminates us and never sets... The Sun of a Hardworking People, a People Victorious by virtue of being Hardworking, being Heroic, being Brave, being Noble, a People full of Faith, a Christian People.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is made of Vigor, of Glory, of Faith, of Hope, of Trust, of Certainty. We are made to be Free and we are made to advance and make our way in that Always Further On which our General of Free Men and Women, Augusto Sandino, left us as a Magnificent Motto.</p>

<p>An embrace to all the families. An embrace to the Families of the Graduates, to the Graduates, and above all, for the assurance all of us have that each one of them, each one of their Families represent pillars for the Secure, Fullfilling Future of Nicaragua's Families.</p>

<p>Warm embraces, Compañeras and Compañeros.</p>
