<h3><br />
<b>NICARAGUA: </b> <b>IN </b> <b>DEFENSE </b> <b>OF </b> <b>NATIONAL </b> <b>SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW </b></h3>

<p><b>13th June 2021 </b></p>

<p><b>I. A </b> <b>LEGAL </b> <b>FRAMEWORK </b> <b>THAT </b> <b>ENSURES </b> <b>DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW </b></p>

<p>An unprecedented and relentless attack is unfolding against the People and Government of Nicaragua, driven by false narratives advanced by rightwing and U.S. financed media outlets and “opposition figures.”</p>

<p>In the light of evidence that has been presented against certain individuals and organizations, related to the crimes of money laundering, fraud, treason and seditious conspiracy, the Office of the Nicaraguan Attorney General began an investigation into the dealings of Cristiana Chamorro and her “Fundación Violeta Barrios de Chammorro for Reconciliation and Democracy (FVBCH),” that received tens of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars through USAID, NED, IRI and other U.S. government agencies, that were then transferred through corporate and personal accounts to Chamorro family members, including her brother Carlos Fernando Chammorro (CINCO, Confidencial) and her uncle Jaime Chamorro Cardenal (La Prensa); as well as to other affiliated organizations such as, Channel 10, Channel 11, Channel 12, and Vos TV, Radio Corporación and Radio Show Café con Voz; as well as online outlets 100% Noticias, Artículo 66, Nicaragua Investiga, Nicaragua Actual, BacanalNica, and Despacho 505.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Attorney General's investigation therefore, is to determine, whether Cristiana Chammorro and her FVBCH have committed any crimes as related to Law No. 1040, that requires organizations to report in detail any funding they receive from abroad and Law No. 1055, that protects the Nicaraguan People against the crimes of treason and seditious conspiracy.</p>

<p>The investigation is being conducted in a thorough and transparent manner, with periodic updates being published in a timely manner to inform the Nicaraguan People of its progress.</p>

<p>It is important to highlight that similar legislations exist throughout North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and the rest of the world and moreover, Governments have zero tolerance for crimes of this nature. Consider for example, articles 2381 through 2390 of the United States Legal Code that contains definitions and punishments related to the crimes of Treason, Misprision of treason, Rebellion or insurrection, Seditious Conspiracy, Advocating the overthrow of Government, Registration of Foreign Organizations, Activities affecting armed forces Generally, Activities affecting armed forces during war, and recruiting for service against the United States; all of which are federally prosecuted and may entail punishments that range from death to imprisonment, to fines and to the prohibition from running for public office.</p>

<p>Any attempt, therefore, by a national or foreign actor to undermine an investigation of this nature, must also be viewed in the context of the standing legislation, and perceived as an outright attack against the principles of respect for the rule of law, democracy, national sovereignty and self- determination in Nicaragua.</p>

<p><br />
<b>II. ELECTORAL REFORMS, POLITICAL PARTIES </b> <b>AND THE NICARAGUA OPPOSITION </b></p>

<p><b>A. ELECTORAL REFORMS: </b></p>

<p>Nicaragua’s best practices related to democracy and citizens’ participation include: (1) Ongoing citizens’ education campaign in Spanish, English, Miskito and Mayagna, prioritizing voters’ registration and actively promoting voting as a right and a civic responsibility; (2) Continuous expansion of the network of voting stations in order to include the most remote communities; (3) Strengthening of the communal voting system, in which voting stations do not exceed 400 citizens, allowing for a greater familiarity among voters; (4) Representation of all political parties among the members of each voting station; (5) Training and certification of Political Party Monitors that are located within the voting stations during the voting process and while ballots are being counted; (6) Legal reforms and policies aimed at ensuring a 50% participation of women in all publicly elected spaces; (7) Technical improvement to voters' identification card to ensure a “one person one vote system”, including detailed biometric photography, registration number, bar codes, watermarks, among others; and (8) Continuous updating of the general voters' list in order to integrate new citizens and remove those who have changed address or have died.</p>

<p>Additionally, on 4 May, the Nicaragua National Assembly enacted Law 1070, Law of Reforms and Additions to Law 331, Electoral Law, following a consultation process between the Special Committee of Parliament and the representations of the 19 registered political parties that exist within the country.</p>

<p>Electoral Reforms were aimed at ensuring Coherence and Harmony between the Electoral Law and the Constitution in the light of the 2014 reforms, ensure gender equality, promote the use of new information and communications technologies, update relevant electoral cartography, strengthening civil registration processes, protect the rights of political parties and political alliances, and ensure respect for the rights of sovereignty, self- determination and national independence.</p>

<p>A new Supreme Electoral Council was also elected in May, that includes one-third of members from outside of the FSLN and is also one of the most diverse electoral bodies in the region, with several indigenous and afrodescendant magistrates and boasting a female majority.</p>

<p>The new Electoral Law prohibits political parties from accepting foreign funding from any source or in any shape or form. However, the State of Nicaragua will allocate 1% of the General Budget of the Republic to reimburse the expenses of the Electoral Campaign incurred by the Political Parties or Alliances of Political Parties, that participate in Elections.</p>

<p>In coherence with the provisions of articles 4 and 10, subsection (5) of Law number 1070 "Law of Reform and Additions to Law 331, Electoral Law", the Supreme Electoral Council of the Republic of Nicaragua prepared and approved in consensus with the political parties, the Electoral Calendar, which was published in the Official Gazette, on 11 May, 2021. The following are the key dates of the Nicaragua Electoral Calendar:</p>

<p><b>12 MAY </b> Registration application for the constitution of Political Party Alliances.</p>

<p><b>24-25 JULY </b> Citizen’s verification in the Electoral Registry.</p>

<p><b>18 AUGUST </b> Definitive publication of the candidate lists.</p>

<p><b>21 AUGUST – 03 NOVEMBER </b> Electoral Campaign Period.</p>

<p><b>08 SEPTEMBER </b> Last day for changing of addresses in Electoral Registry.</p>

<p><b>10 OCTOBER </b> Appointment of the members of the Voting Stations.</p>

<p><b>07 NOVEMBER </b> Suffrage and transmission of results.</p>

<p><b>25 NOVEMBER </b> Proclamation of the elected.</p>

<p><br />
<b>B. POLITICAL PARTIES AND ALLIANCES: </b></p>

<p>In accordance with the Electoral Calendar, as of 14 May, 19 national and regional political parties have duly constituted and registered to participate in the 2021 National Elections, either individually or in alliance.</p>

<p><b>National Political Parties: </b></p>

<p>1. Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC)<br />
2. Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)<br />
3. Independent Liberal Party (PLI)<br />
4. Citizens for Freedom (CxL)<br />
5. Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN)<br />
6. Conservative Party (PC)<br />
7. Christian Unity Party (PUC)<br />
8. Alternative for Change (AC)<br />
9. Alliance for the Republic (APRE)<br />
10. Nicaraguan Christian Way (CCN)<br />
11. Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance Party (ALN)<br />
12. Nationalist Liberal Party (PLN)<br />
13. Christian Restoration Party (PRD)</p>

<p><b>Regional Political Parties: </b><br />
14. Coastal Unity Movement Party (PAMUC)<br />
15. Yapti Tasba Masraka Nanih Aslatakanka (YATAMA)<br />
16. Yapti Tasba Masraka Raya Nani Movement Party (MYATAMARAN)<br />
17. Indigenous Multi-ethnic Party (PIM)<br />
18. Autonomous Liberal Party (PAL)<br />
19. Moskitia Pawanka</p>

<p>A total of 11 political parties requested to run in alliances, 2 in the Alliance "Citizens for Freedom", led by Citizens for Freedom and 9 in the Alliance "United Nicaragua Triumphs, led by the FSLN."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, 18 May, the legal status of the Conservative Party (CP) was cancelled, because its legal representative presented a resolution on 9 May, deciding NOT TO PARTICIPATE in the electoral process, which constitutes a violation of the Electoral Law, that establishes “...refusal to participate in a convened election is an explicit cause of cancellation of the legal status of any given political party.”</p>

<p>The legal status of the Democratic Restoration Party (PRD), was also revoked given this political party did not register changes made to its Statutes and By Laws.</p>

<p><br />
<b>C. THE SO-CALLED OPPOSITION: </b></p>

<p>As expressed above, the registered political parties and alliances are abiding by the provisions of the Constitution and the Electoral Law and are working tirelessly to participate in the November Elections.</p>

<p>A few individuals, however, that have not registered or been selected as the presidential candidate of any political party, have been falsely claiming to represent the “true Nicaragua opposition,” undermining the efforts of the political parties, and aiming to disqualify any possible candidate that may arise.</p>

<p>The only thing that this group of opposition usurpers share in common is their allegiance to the government of the United States of America and the fact that they have directly or through their respective NGO's, received millions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer money through USAID, NED, IRI and other agencies, aimed at overthrowing the elected government of President Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra.</p>

<p>For their actions, several of these individuals are currently being investigated by the Office of the Nicaragua Attorney General, in the framework of Laws No. 1040 and 1055.</p>

<p>As the Attorney General's investigation, in part, calls into question the use of funds provided by foreign governments, high level officers of these governments has sought to sidetrack its progress, seeking instead to focus international opinion on the “possible candidacies” of the accused, instead of on the likelihood that the resources of its people are being used to destabilize an entire nation, even in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic.</p>

<p>These governments are also lobbying and pressuring the Members of the Organization of American States (OAS), with the purpose of approving resolutions that interfere in the internal and sovereign affairs of Nicaragua, in what can only be considered a gross violation of the Purposes and Principles of International Law, the UN Democratic Charter and the Interamerican Democratic Charter.</p>

<p><br />
<b>III. THE WAY FORWARD </b></p>

<p>Nicaragua is committed to the celebration of a free, fair and transparent general election this coming 07 November. In this regard, Nicaragua must demand noninterference by any foreign government, given that an opinion or declaration expressed by a foreign government, can affect the proper implementation of the electoral process.</p>

<p>In reference to the ongoing investigation of the Attorney General against individuals that are being accused for the crimes of money laundering, fraud, treason or seditious conspiracy, the Government of Nicaragua states that a thorough investigation carried out without interference from national or foreign actors, and that yields a fair verdict, is the only result that can contribute to Peace, Reconciliation, the Rule of Law and Democracy in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>As a good neighbor and member of the international community, Nicaragua does not represent a threat to any country of the world, on the contrary, Nicaragua has always aimed to establish bilateral relations based on mutual respect, solidarity and cooperation.</p>

<p>Within the American Hemisphere, Nicaragua is a key ally in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime, as it continues to implement the successful containment wall strategy with its partners.</p>

<p>Nicaragua does not contribute significantly to irregular migration, as it aims to create the necessary conditions to boost local production, promote Central American economic integration and attract investments that generate jobs for its people at home. Nicaragua also stands proudly with the Peoples and Governments of Central America and the Caribbean, that are among the most vulnerable to the effects of Climate Change.</p>

<p>As Nicaragua continues to fight against the COVID19 pandemic, it has repeatedly called for justice and equality regarding access and distribution of the vaccines, denouncing any attempt to hoard the available doses and calling for greater international solidarity.</p>

<p>Finally, Nicaragua demands that all unilateral, coercive and illegal measures imposed on countries, institutions or individuals must be eliminated. Reiterating that the application of such measures in times of pandemic, raises their illegality to the level of a crime against humanity. The only legal sanctions are those of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
