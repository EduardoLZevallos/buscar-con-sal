<p><i><b>DISPUTE CONCERNING ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF SOVEREIGN RIGHTS AND MARITIME SPACES IN THE CARIBBEAN SEA</b></i></p>

<p><b>(Nicaragua v. Colombia)</b></p>

<p><b>ORAL PLEADINGS</b></p>

<p><b>THE FACTS REGARDING COLOMBIA’S VIOLATIONS OF NICARAGUA’S RIGHTS</b></p>

<p><b>Paul S. Reichler</b></p>

<p><b>20 September 2021</b></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">I.Madame President, Members of the Court: it is, as always, an honour for me to appear before you, and it is a privilege to do so on behalf of Nicaragua in these proceedings. I am deeply grateful to the Court for allowing counsel to plead virtually from their home countries, and thus avoid the risks of international travel during this period of heightened public health concern.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">II.My task today is to address the facts pertaining to the present dispute, concerning Colombia’s violations of Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in Nicaragua’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, as delimited by the Court in the Judgment of 19 November 2012.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">III.I will discuss these facts under three headings in the following order: <i>first,</i> facts concerning Colombia’s rejection of the Court’s 2012 Judgment, including its refusal to accept the boundary established by the Court, and its ongoing insistence – to the present day – on its own sovereign rights and jurisdiction in areas located on Nicaragua’s side of the delimitation line; <i>second, </i>facts concerning Colombia’s establishment of a so-called Integral Contiguous Zone, encompassing parts of Nicaragua’s EEZ and continental shelf, in furtherance of Colombia’s assertion of sovereign rights and jurisdiction beyond the limits of the maritime areas attributed to it by the Court; and the revival, and maintenance to this day, of its pre-Judgment claim to all of the maritime space east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian; and <i>third</i>, facts concerning the Colombian Navy’s physical interference with Nicaragua’s exercise of sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its EEZ, based on the assertion that the 2012 Judgment is inapplicable, and that Colombia is therefore entitled to exercise its own sovereign rights and jurisdiction in these waters.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">IV.Although, for clarity, I will address these three sets of facts under separate headings, they are all closely linked, and constitute inseparable parts of the same dispute. All of Colombia’s wrongful actions, including those of its Navy, since Nicaragua’s <i>Application </i>was filed, relate back to Colombia’s rejection of the 2012 Judgment, its refusal to accept the boundary with Nicaragua established by the Court, and its reassertion of a claim to the entire area east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian, the same claim that Colombia advanced before the Court, and the Court rejected.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.64cm; line-height: 150%">V.In fact, pursuant to this revived claim, the Colombian Navy, upon confronting Nicaraguan coast guard vessels in this area, warned them, in recorded audio messages, some of which you will hear today, that the Court’s Judgment was inapplicable, exactly as the President of Colombia first declared in November 2012; that all of the waters east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian were Colombian, and that Nicaragua had no jurisdiction in these waters.</p>

<h1 class="western">VI.Colombia’s Rejection of the 2012 Judgment and the Boundary Fixed by the Court</h1>

<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-left: 3.81cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height:&#10;      115%" xml:lang="en-GB"> </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">VII.The statements by Colombia’s President denouncing the 2012 Judgment, disavowing it, and rejecting the boundary fixed by the Court are set out in Nicaragua’s Memorial. My purpose in reading some of them aloud today is not to rub salt in Colombia’s self-inflicted wounds; nor is it to inflame passions by recalling remarks that are truly disturbing, not only for their impact on Nicaragua’s own hard-won rights, but for their disregard of the rule of law, and for the sanctity of the judgments issued by the world’s supreme judicial authority<b>.</b> Rather, Nicaragua invokes these statements here for the sole reason that they constitute the origin of the dispute that is presently before the Court, as well as the basis and the alleged justification for the actions subsequently carried out by Colombia, including by its Navy, in flagrant violation of Nicaragua’s rights, as determined by the 2012 Judgment. As such, these statements explain, and cannot be separated from, the unlawful conduct to which they gave rise, and thus, like those actions, constitute part of a single, indivisible dispute.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">VIII.To be precise, Colombia did not reject or disavow the entire 2012 Judgment. It was perfectly content to accept and applaud the Court’s ruling on sovereignty over disputed islands, which its President, Juan Manuel Santos, described as “a final and unappealable judgment on this issue.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc" id="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a> Colombia’s rejection of the Judgment was selectively limited to the maritime boundary in the Caribbean Sea, which President Santos described as riddled with what he called “omissions, errors, excesses and inconsistencies that we cannot accept.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc" id="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> The conclusion, in the President’s own words, <b>SLIDE 1 </b>was: “Colombia – represented by its Head of State – emphatically rejects that aspect of the judgment rendered by the Court today.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc" id="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">IX.Within 10 days of the Judgment, Colombia formally denounced the Pact of Bogota, withdrawing its acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc" id="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> President Santos left no doubt that this was in further rejection <b>SLIDE 2 </b>of the Court’s Judgment: “I have decided that the highest national interests demand that the territorial and maritime boundaries be fixed through treaties, as has been the legal tradition of Colombia, and not through judgments rendered by the International Court of Justice.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc" id="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">X.It might have been hoped that Colombia, disappointed with this aspect of the Judgment, would eventually reconcile itself to it, and that its extreme reaction would ultimately give way to conduct more befitting a responsible State, like the one gave the name of its capital to a historic agreement – the Pact of Bogota – under which the States Parties agreed to submit their disputes with one another to the Court. Unfortunately, such was not the case. Ten months after the Judgment, in September 2013, <b>SLIDE 3 </b>President Santos again declared: “The Judgment of the International Court of Justice is not applicable – it is not and will not be applicable – until a treaty that protects the rights of Colombians has been celebrated, a treaty that will have to be approved in accordance with our Constitution. I repeat the decision I have made: the judgment of the International Court IS NOT APPLICABLE without a treaty.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc" id="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XI. Of even greater concern, upon making this statement, President Santos ordered the Armed Forces High Command to “defend with ‘cloak and sword’ the continental shelf Colombia has in the Caribbean Sea.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc" id="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a> The High Command understood this as a call to defend the entire maritime area historically claimed by Colombia east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian, notwithstanding the delimitation effected by the Court’s 2012 Judgment. Vice Admiral Hernando Wills Velez, the Commander of the Colombian Navy, responded to the President’s call by declaring that his forces would “comply with the order of the Head of State to exercise sovereignty throughout the Colombian Caribbean Sea,”<b> </b>since “the judgment of The Hague is inapplicable,” and the Colombian Navy would fulfil its duty “to defend all the Colombian maritime space”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc" id="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XII. And that is exactly what the Colombian Navy proceeded to do, including by interfering with, and preventing, Nicaragua’s exercise of its sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its own EEZ, in areas that unmistakably fall on the Nicaraguan side of the boundary fixed by the Court, as I will describe in the third part of my presentation.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.64cm; line-height: 150%">XIII. To conclude this first part, it is indisputable, and Colombia does not seriously attempt to dispute, that it denounced, rejected and refused to accept the maritime boundary fixed by the Court in its 2012 Judgment, and that, as of September 2013, by order of its President, its Armed Forces had pledged to disregard that Judgment and enforce Colombia’s claims against Nicaragua, including its purported sovereign rights and jurisdiction, in the areas east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian that the Court had determined to fall within Nicaragua’s EEZ. Nor can it now be disputed that this has remained Colombia’s official position until today: <b>SLIDE 4</b>.<b> </b>This is what its current President, Ivan Duque, said as recently as 1 September 2021: “The 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian is the boundary we have today with Nicaragua and that is why we are very clear that our Constitution says that Colombia’s limits can only be modified through treaties; we are defenders of its integrality.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc" id="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a> All of these statements by Colombia’s Presidents can be found at Tab <b>6 </b>of your Judges’ Folders.</p>

<h1 class="western">XIV.Colombia’s Establishment of an Integral Contiguous Zone and Renewed Claim to All of the Maritime Space East of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian</h1>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XV.This brings me to the second part of my presentation, Colombia’s establishment of an Integral Contiguous Zone, and the renewal of its claim to all maritime space east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian, despite the Court’s rejection of that claim. The Integral Contiguous Zone was established by Presidential Decree No. 1946, on 9 September 2013.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc" id="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a><b> </b>Article 5 describes the “Contiguous Zone of the Western Caribbean Sea <i>Insular</i> Territories”. Paragraph 1 of that Article declares a contiguous zone of 24 M around the Western Caribbean Insular Territories, but this is expressly without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2, which extend it beyond 24 M in order to “connect” the contiguous zones of the various islands of the San Andrés Archipelago, so that they form “a continuous zone and uninterrupted zone of the whole of the San Andrés, Providencia and Catalina Department”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc" id="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a><b> </b></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XVI. Upon introducing this Decree, President Santos displayed a map illustrating the extent of the newly created Integral Contiguous Zone<b>.</b><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc" id="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a> <b>SLIDE 5 </b>This slide shows President Santos and his map. Next is the same Integral Contiguous Zone displayed by President Santos <b>SLIDE 6 </b>superimposed on the maritime boundary established by the Court, as reflected in sketch map no. 11 from the Judgment. Here, we have highlighted in pink <b>SLIDE 7 </b>the areas where the Integral Contiguous Zone overlaps waters attributed by the Court to Nicaragua as its EEZ. As can easily be seen, the Integral Contiguous Zone depicted by President Santos in 2013 substantially transgresses areas subject to Nicaragua’s exclusive sovereign rights and jurisdiction. All three of these maps of Colombia’s Integral Contiguous Zone are at Tab <b>7 </b>of your Judges’ Folders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XVII. Here is another map of the Integral Contiguous Zone, provided by Colombia in its Rejoinder. <b>SLIDE 8 </b>This map, which is also at Tab <b>8 </b>of your folders, is helpfully entitled, by Colombia itself: “Areas of Colombia’s ICZ lying beyond 24 M and within Nicaragua’s EEZ”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc" id="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> I am tempted to say: “QED”. But there is much more to say, and it gets much worse for Colombia.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XVIII. First, Colombia’s transgression of Nicaragua’s EEZ was exacerbated by the powers Colombia attributed to itself in its Integral Contiguous Zone. <b>SLIDE 9 </b>According to President Santos: “In this Integral Contiguous Zone we will exercise jurisdiction and control over all areas related to security and the struggle against delinquency, and over fiscal, customs, environmental, immigration and health matters and other areas as well.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc" id="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a> This presidential statement is at Tab <b>9 </b>of your folders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XIX. At Tab <b>10</b>, you will find <b>SLIDE 10</b> that Decree 1946 itself specifies that “the Colombian State shall exercise in the established Integral Contiguous Zone <i>its sovereign authority</i> and the powers for the implementation and the necessary control regarding: [<i>inter alia</i>] environmental protection, cultural patrimony and the exercise of historic rights to fishing held by the State of Colombia …”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc" id="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a><b> </b>Colombia later modified the Decree by deleting the reference to fishing rights.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc" id="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> But, in practice, Colombia has continued to assert and enforce them, as you will soon see. In its Rejoinder, Colombia acknowledges that, under international law, “The contiguous zone does not bestow upon the coastal State any territorial or sovereign rights.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc" id="sdfootnote17anc"><sup>17</sup></a> But those are exactly the rights that Decree 1946 expressly attributes to Colombia in its Integral Contiguous Zone, and that Colombia itself has continuously exercised.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XX. As Professor Lowe will show, the rights a coastal State may exercise in a properly established contiguous zone, that is, one that does not extend across an international boundary, do not include control of fishing or environmental protection.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc" id="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a> And, as Mr. Martin will show on Friday, Colombia has no fishing rights, historic or otherwise, in any of the areas the Court determined to be within Nicaragua’s EEZ. Yet, in practice, as I will come to in the final part of my presentation, Colombia has invoked its Integral Contiguous Zone, and the powers declared thereunder, as well as its resurrected claim to all of the maritime area east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian, to justify its exercise of sovereign rights and jurisdiction in Nicaragua’s EEZ, including its authorization of Colombian and foreign-flagged vessels to fish in Nicaragua’s waters; and its prevention of Nicaraguan-authorized vessels from fishing or conducting marine scientific research in those same waters.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XXI. By 2014, it became clear that Colombia’s pretentions to sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the areas determined by the Court to belong to Nicaragua went well beyond the limits of the Integral Contiguous Zone. President Santos declared at that time that Colombia’s exclusive rights and jurisdiction extended over the entire area that Colombia had claimed prior to the Court’s Judgment, as if the Judgment were never issued, that is, all the waters <b>SLIDE 11 </b>east of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian: “In consequence, for our country as long as a new treaty is not signed – the limits of Colombia with Nicaragua continue to be those established in the [1928] Esguerra-Barcenas Treaty. That is to say, the limits previous to the International Court of Justice’s judgment.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc" id="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a> This statement is at Tab <b>11 </b>of the folders.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XXII.This was not a mere rhetorical exercise. It was the position and policy of the Colombian State, as pronounced by the Head of State himself. And it has remained Colombia’s official position. To this day, Colombia claims that its maritime rights and jurisdiction are limited not by the boundary fixed by the Court, but by the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian, and that everything to the east is theirs, in complete abnegation of Nicaragua’s judicially determined rights in this area. This map, <b>SLIDE 12 </b>which is at Tab <b>12 </b>of the folders, is from a power point presentation given by the Commander of the Colombian Navy, Admiral Hernando Wills Vélez, on 3 March 2015. It remains available today on a Navy-connected website.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote20sym" name="sdfootnote20anc" id="sdfootnote20anc"><sup>20</sup></a> It is captioned “Areas of Responsibility of the National Navy”. The map depicts Colombia’s maritime boundaries in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. In the Caribbean, boundaries are shown with all of Colombia’s neighbours, including Nicaragua, where the boundary is depicted as the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian. This is where, according to Colombia, Nicaragua’s maritime jurisdiction ends.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XXIII.<b> </b>The same power-point presentation, by the Commander of the Colombian Navy, also includes this map, <b>SLIDE 13 </b>captioned “National Navy Areas of Operation”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote21sym" name="sdfootnote21anc" id="sdfootnote21anc"><sup>21</sup></a> It too is at Tab<b> 13</b>.<b> </b>I call your attention to the blue dot, in the upper left part of the map.

I turn now to the third and final part of my presentation, which addresses Colombia’s physical acts of interference with Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its own EEZ, as defined by the Court in its 2012 Judgment. In its written pleadings, Nicaragua identified and offered proof of 51 such acts by Colombia’s Armed Forces, particularly its Navy, from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2018. These, too, are not separate, isolated events, but manifestations of the same dispute that began with Colombia’s rejection of the Court’s 2012 Judgment, its denial of Nicaragua’s rights thereunder, its reversion to its pre-Judgment position that the boundary is the 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian, and its attribution to itself of sovereign rights and jurisdiction that exclusively belong to Nicaragua under the 2012 Judgment.</p>

These incidents, all of them except for the last one, have occurred in or near the rich fishing area known as <i>Luna Verde</i>, <b>SLIDE 29 </b>depicted here in green, and at Tab <b>28 </b>of your folders. As you can see, it is plainly within Nicaragua’s EEZ. Nevertheless, Colombia has made no secret of its encouragement of Colombian and foreign-flagged vessels to fish at <i>Luna Verde</i>. For example, Resolution No. 4780, issued by the General Maritime Directorate of the Department of the Archipelago of San Andrés and Providencia <b>SLIDE 30 </b>on 24 September 2015, grants an “Industrial Commercial Fishing Permit” to the owner of the company <i>Pesquera Serranilla</i> to fish in “the area known as ‘la esquina’ or ‘luna verde’, which includes our insular territory and fishing zones.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote66sym" name="sdfootnote66anc" id="sdfootnote66anc"><sup>66</sup></a><b> </b>As this permit makes clear, it licenses “Industrial Commercial” fishing. That is what Colombia has regularly licensed at <i>Luna Verde, </i>in Nicaragua’s EEZ. The evidence thus belies Colombia’s claim that it only licenses small-scale, artisanal fishing by local island inhabitants in these waters. As Mr. Martin will show on Friday, even if Colombia’s issuance of fishing licenses were limited to artisanal fishing, which is not the case, this would still violate Nicaragua’s exclusive fishing rights in its EEZ under well-established principles of customary international law.</p>

On 8 October 2018, the Colombian naval frigate <i>ARC-51 Almirante Padilla</i> stopped the Mexican-flagged research ship, the <i>Dr. Jorge Carranza Fraser</i>, which had been licensed by Nicaragua under a research project funded by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote68sym" name="sdfootnote68anc" id="sdfootnote68anc"><sup>68</sup></a> <b>SLIDE 32 </b>The incident occurred along this route, depicted in red on this map, which was submitted to the Court by Colombia, and is included in the Judges’ Folders at Tab <b>30</b>. Although the entire route followed by the Mexican research vessel, as shown by Colombia, was within Nicaragua’s EEZ, the Colombian frigate forced it to leave the area, and prevented it from completing its mission. These facts are confirmed by correspondence from the Director General of Mexico’s National Institute of Fishing and Aquaculture, which is part of the Mexican Department of Agriculture, to his Nicaraguan counterpart.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote69sym" name="sdfootnote69anc" id="sdfootnote69anc"><sup>69</sup></a> The Mexican Director General’s letter, dated 16 April 2019, which is at Tab <b>31 </b>of your folders, <b>SLIDE 33</b> and shown here in relevant part, explained that his institute’s research vessel had been unable to complete its mission due to<b>:</b> “an interception by a marine military patrol from the government of a third country to the Jorge Carranza Fraser vessel during the cruise in the areas near the missing transects, indicating that it was sailing without permits in the waters of its marine jurisdiction, escorting the vessel Jorge Carranza Fraser until it departed the area.”</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">XLIX. There is no doubt about the identity of the “third country” referred to by the Mexican official. Colombia itself acknowledges this. Nor is there any doubt that the Mexican vessel was navigating within Nicaragua’s waters when it was “intercepted” by a “marine military patrol” from that third country. Colombia’s own map, which I just showed you, demonstrates this.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">L.All of this evidence – as well as the evidence of the dozens of other, similar incidents described in Nicaragua’s pleadings – demonstrates the hypocrisy of Colombia’s insistence, in its Rejoinder, that its actions in these waters have allowed Nicaragua to “continue to enjoy its sovereign rights in its EEZ.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote70sym" name="sdfootnote70anc" id="sdfootnote70anc"><sup>70</sup></a> The evidence also belies Colombia’s assertion that its actions reflect nothing more than its exercise of the right of freedom of navigation.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote71sym" name="sdfootnote71anc" id="sdfootnote71anc"><sup>71</sup></a> Earlier this month, Colombia’s own President let the cat out of the bag, again, and dispensed entirely with these pretexts, as I displayed on your screens earlier: “The 82<sup>nd</sup> Meridian is the boundary we have today with Nicaragua”. Freedom of navigation? That is not what the President of Colombia said. Nor is it what the Colombian Navy itself repeatedly told Nicaragua it was protecting. Rather, in the recorded words of its naval commanders, it was engaging, repeatedly, in the exercise of Colombia’s sovereign authority over these waters, and especially to protect Colombia’s “historic fishing rights” in areas the Court declared to constitute Nicaragua’s EEZ.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote72sym" name="sdfootnote72anc" id="sdfootnote72anc"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LII. Faced with its inability to defend the indefensible, Colombia seeks refuge in a casuistic jurisdictional argument that would erase all these incidents from the case, as if they never took place, on grounds that they are beyond the scope of the present dispute, hence outside the Court’s jurisdiction. In its Counter Memorial, Colombia simply refused to address any of the incidents that post-dated 27 November 2013, the effective date of its withdrawal from the Pact of Bogota, arguing that these incidents were separate disputes, each of which arose after the jurisdictional title for Nicaragua’s <i>Application</i> had lapsed.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote75sym" name="sdfootnote75anc" id="sdfootnote75anc"><sup>75</sup></a><b> </b>In its Rejoinder, Colombia likewise refused to discuss any of these incidents in the main body of its text, relegating its response to an Appendix.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote76sym" name="sdfootnote76anc" id="sdfootnote76anc"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LIII.Colombia can run from these incidents, but it cannot hide from them. Certainly not behind a half-baked jurisdictional argument. In its Judgment of 17 March 2016, the Court rejected Colombia’s Second Preliminary Objection, and affirmed its jurisdiction over: “dispute concerning the alleged violations by Colombia of Nicaragua’s rights in the maritime zones which, according to Nicaragua, the Court declared in its 2012 Judgment appertain to Nicaragua.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote77sym" name="sdfootnote77anc" id="sdfootnote77anc"><sup>77</sup></a> The Court found that this dispute existed as of the time that Nicaragua filed its <i>Application</i> on 26 November 2013, which it regarded as the critical date for jurisdictional purposes.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote78sym" name="sdfootnote78anc" id="sdfootnote78anc"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LIV.Colombia would interpret the Court’s Judgment as limiting its jurisdiction only to acts by Colombia which occurred before that date. But the Judgment of 17 March 2016 does not say that. It does not limit the Court’s jurisdiction to acts occurring before 26 November 2013; it affirms jurisdiction over the dispute<i> </i>that arose prior to that date. Thus, as Professor Pellet has explained, acts by Colombia afterwards that are part of the same dispute inevitably fall within the jurisdictional scope of this case.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LV.The Court was called upon to decide what was fundamentally the same question, that is, whether subsequent and ongoing violations of the Applicant State’s rights relate back to the date the dispute arose, or constitute new and separate disputes, in the case concerning <i>Legality of Use of Force</i><i> (Yugoslavia v. Belgium). </i>In that case, NATO’s bombing of targets in Yugoslavia, which was the subject of the dispute between the parties, began on 24 March 1999. This was before Yugoslavia made its Article 36(2) declaration on 25 April 1999, and filed its application four days later. Yugoslavia, like Colombia, attempted to slice the dispute into discrete pieces. It argued that each bombing incident gave rise to a new and separate dispute distinct from the original one, such that bombings after 25 April 1999 fell within the jurisdiction of the Court even though the NATO bombing campaign, began before that date.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LVI.The Court upheld Belgium’s preliminary objection on the ground that the individual bombing incidents after Yugoslavia’s Article 36(2) declaration were part of the same dispute that arose prior to it, and thus, like the dispute itself, fell outside the scope of its jurisdiction. The Court explained that “each individual air attack could not have given rise to a separate subsequent dispute”, because “Yugoslavia has not established that new disputes, distinct from the initial one, have arisen between the Parties since 25 April 1999 in respect of subsequent situations or facts attributable to Belgium …”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote79sym" name="sdfootnote79anc" id="sdfootnote79anc"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LVII. This was not the first time the Court ruled as such. In the <i>Fisheries Jurisdiction </i>case<i> </i>(<i>Germany v. Iceland</i>), Germany alleged violations of its rights by Iceland that post-dated its Application. The Court had no difficulty holding that it had jurisdiction over these actions, on the ground that they constituted part of the same dispute that was submitted in the Application: “The Court cannot accept the view that it would lack jurisdiction to deal with this submission. The matter raised therein is part of the controversy between the Parties, and constitutes a dispute relating to Iceland’s extension of its fisheries jurisdiction. The submission is one based on facts subsequent to the filing of the Application, but arising directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of that Application.”<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote80sym" name="sdfootnote80anc" id="sdfootnote80anc"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LVIII.The same is true here. Colombia’s violations of Nicaragua’s EEZ rights after November 2013 were unquestionably part of the same dispute raised by Nicaragua in its <i>Application</i> over which the Court affirmed its jurisdiction, that is, in the Court’s language, “the dispute concerning the alleged violations by Colombia of Nicaragua’s rights in the maritime zones which, according to Nicaragua, the Court declared in its 2012 Judgment appertain to Nicaragua”.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="12946.html#sdfootnote81sym" name="sdfootnote81anc" id="sdfootnote81anc"><sup>81</sup></a> Because the Court ruled that it has jurisdiction over this dispute, all of the individual incidents that form part of it, or relate back to it, necessarily fall within that same jurisdictional competence. Just as each post-Application bombing of Yugoslavia did not give rise to a new dispute, separate from the one that arose when the bombings first commenced, neither did the Colombian Navy’s recurring and repeated violations of Nicaragua’s sovereign rights and jurisdiction in Nicaragua’s EEZ constitute new disputes separate from the one raised by Nicaragua in its Application. And, just as Iceland’s post-Application actions arose directly out of the subject matter of Germany’s Application, Colombia’s actions after 2013 arose directly out of the subject matter of Nicaragua’s <i>Application</i>.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-left: 1.27cm; text-indent: -1.27cm; margin-bottom:&#10;      0.42cm; line-height: 150%">LIX. As a consequence, Colombia cannot escape its international responsibility for violating Nicaragua’s rights on jurisdictional grounds, any more than it can avoid its responsibility on the merits.</p>
