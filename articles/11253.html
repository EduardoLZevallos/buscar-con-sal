<br />
21ST MEETING OF THE ALBA-TCP POLITICAL COUNCIL<br />
<br />
CARACAS, MARCH 1ST, 2021</strong><br />
<br />
Virtual Format</h3>

<p><em><strong>The Ministers of Foreign Relations of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – People's Trade Treaty (ALBA-TCP), on the occasion of the 21st Meeting of the Political Council, held in virtual format on March 1st, 2021:</strong></em></p>

<p>1.    We reaffirm our commitment to a genuinely Latin American and Caribbean integration, which will allow us to jointly face the imperialist attempts at domination and the growing threats to regional peace and stability, multilateralism and the principles of International Law, including respect for the self-determination of peoples, sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference in the internal affairs of the States, as well as the prohibition and threat of the use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes, as endorsed in the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace.</p>

<p>2.    We denounce the war and domination policies carried out by Western countries, particularly the United States of America, that even in times of deep world crisis caused by the COVID 19 pandemic do not cease in their attempts to subdue sovereign States, such as the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic. In this regard, we recall the urgent appeal of the Secretary General of the United Nations “for a global ceasefire in all corners of the world”.</p>

<p>3.    We strongly urge the immediate lifting of the unilateral coercive measures imposed by the U.S., which prevent the affected countries from fighting against COVID-19, especially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua.</p>

<p>4.    We reiterate the call made by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of Human Rights, Ms. Alena Douhan, urging the United States, the European Union and other States to lift the unilateral sanctions imposed on the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.</p>

<p>5.    We strongly demand the immediate and absolute cessation of the U.S. economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba and urge an immediate end to the possibility of filing lawsuits in U.S. courts under Title III of the Helms-Burton Act.</p>

<p>6.     We reiterate ALBA-TCP's strong condemnation of all terrorist acts, methods and practices in all their forms and expressions, including those cases in which States are directly or indirectly involved; which is totally inadmissible regardless of the grounds, considerations or factors invoked.</p>

<p>7.    We strongly and categorically condemn the designation of Cuba as a State sponsor of terrorism by the United States government and its inclusion in the spurious list of the U.S. Department of State.</p>

<p>8.    We express our deep condolences for the fatalities caused by the pandemic in the world and particularly in our region. In the face of the devastating impacts of the multiple crises generated by COVID-19, we must respond in solidarity, in a coordinated and joint manner, in order to guarantee the inclusive and resilient recovery of our economies, which would allow us to strengthen the sustainable development of our peoples, as well as the eradication of poverty.</p>

<p>9.    We recognize that all people, particularly those of the Caribbean, and the Central American isthmus are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and natural disasters. Several countries of the Alliance recently suffer the serious effects of the severe weather events. Therefore, The ALBA-TCP countries commit to continue highlighting the importance of the recognition of "Damage and Loss" in the multilateral processes of financing for climate change.</p>

<p>10.    We reaffirm that the inequitable financial system and the inclusion in lists of non-cooperative jurisdictions, which endanger the small economies of the Caribbean countries; a situation that is exacerbated by the pandemic, with a significant decrease in tourism, a fundamental sector for their income, and limited access to sources of international financing. We call for fair, special and differentiated conditions for them.</p>

<p>11.    We must work together towards wide-ranging immunization against COVID-19 as a global public health priority. Equitable and solidarity-based distribution is imperative to protect the poor and most vulnerable ones. Our peoples have the right to access all essential quality, safe, effective and affordable technologies and health products necessary for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the urgent removal of barriers to such access and distribution, in accordance with the provisions of international agreements.</p>

<p>12.    We hereby denounce the monopolization of vaccines against COVID-19, carried out by the most powerful countries in the world.</p>

<p>13.    We insist on the importance of addressing the special needs of our sister Caribbean countries, which would allow them to benefit from cooperation to prevent and fight against the pandemic.</p>

<p>14.    We recognize the gigantic effort of health professionals, scientists and humanitarian personnel to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions of the world, to defend the right to health and life, even putting their own lives at risk. We highlight the leadership of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the process of coordinating and responding to the pandemic.</p>

<p>15.    We particularly recognize the contribution of the Republic of Cuba to the response to the pandemic, despite the complex circumstances imposed by the tightening of the economic, commercial and financial blockade of the United States and the campaign of its government to discredit and sabotage the international medical cooperation that Cuba offers in dozens of countries and territories, which has benefited millions of people.</p>

<p>16.    We congratulate and recognize the humanistic and altruistic work of the Henry Reeve Cuban Medical Contingent and its contribution to the confrontation of the coronavirus in ALBA-TCP countries and other nations of the world. We welcome the numerous initiatives to formally register the candidacy of this Contingent for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

<p>17.    We congratulate the Bolivian people for the recovery of democracy, thanks to the unity and work of the social organizations, indigenous peoples and peasants. This has resulted in significant advances, especially in the health sector, during the first 100 days of the government led by President Luis Arce Catacora and Vice-president David Choquehuanca.</p>

<p>18.    We reiterate the commitment of the ALBA-TCP member countries to address the most urgent needs such as feeding and food and nutritional security of vulnerable populations, stressing that food production and distribution systems are essential for sustainability and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>19.    We welcome the agreements reached at the recent meetings of ALBA High Level Authorities on Health, Agriculture and Education, revitalizing our Alliance and demonstrating that only with unity is possible to face the serious threats affecting us.</p>
