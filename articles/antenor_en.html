Interview with President of Nicaragua's Central Bank</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
Interviewed by Tortilla con Sal in mid-October this year, the president
of Nicaragua's Central Bank, Dr. Antenor Rosales spoke about the
effects of the international financial crisis on Nicaragua and the
region. Dr. Rosales explains some of the challenges he and his
colleagues face in order to keep prices stable, which is the main remit
of the&nbsp;Central Bank in Nicaragua. The interview is an interesting
portrait of a senior official in a revolutionary government working for
change to benefit the majority, but faced with an opposition majority
in the country's legislature. That adverse national context is now
compounded by a damaging and uncertain international context</span>.<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Tortilla con Sal : When we have talked to other leading members of the
government here, they have generally mentioned problems they encountered
when they took over from their predecessors in the previous
administration. What was your experience when you took over the Central
Bank in January 1987.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Antenor Rosales : What I can&nbsp; tell you is that the process of
taking over Nicaragua's Central Bank was linked to the vision we
brought with us, after discussion with President Ortega that in the
Central bank we needed to insert a mentality of change along with
continuity. So we came to the Central Bank with the institutional aim
of getting the best out of the staff and resources we had to work with,
imprinting on them the philosophy of our government of Unity and
National Reconciliation. So we worked along those lines with the
outgoing president of the bank, Dr. Mario Arana, and given the Bank's
organizational levels one has to remember that we as a political party
were represented on the Board of the Central Bank prior to the victory
of President Ortega by Dr. Silvio Conrado. So to that extent our work
was made easier by an understanding of the Central bank's organic
structural reality </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : In terms of what you found, do you think you were taking over a
body that had been adequately fulfilling the role, objectives and
mission of the Central Bank?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : The Bank is subject to its organic law.&nbsp; In fact, the
previous administrations in the course of their work&nbsp; tried to
abide by that law,. Obviously in doing so the bank authorities did not
always count with the support of Nicaraguan society and that is an
issue still pending, for example the notorious CENIs case.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
What we maintained from the start is that in institutions like this one
we ought to take a series of measures allowing us to strengthen the
Central Bank's institutionality. So you could say that has been the
main internal objective of the Central Bank and clearly of Nicaraguan
society. What we want is that Nicaraguans feel this really is a Bank
for Nicaragua, that it be a Bank of Nicaragua for all Nicaraguans to
promote the particular national project that our country has.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
So in that sense , when we took over the responsibility we did so
convinced that the big decisions of political economy ought to serve
the policies that we as a government of Unity and National Reconciliation have proposed, obviously in strict accordance with the
law.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : One of the issues that has been distorted&nbsp; a lot by people
who criticise the government has been inflation. In the first part of
the year&nbsp; inflation seemed as if it would take off out of control.
But you and your colleagues managed to get a grip on it. Can you
comment on the outlook for inflation in Nicaragua and the region now?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : Sure. The phenomenon of inflation, now, this year is a phenomenon
that has hit the entire world. It's not just something relevant to some
regional or national reality, as has been the historical experience of
economic studies carried out of that phenomenon. In the US, in Canada,
in Mexico, in South America, in Europe especially, in Asia too, in
China for example. The levels of inflation reached in 2008 have been
truly surprising. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
At the beginning of the year we fixed a target that we had to change
during discussions with the International Monetary fund (IMF) because
in fact the basic function of the Central Bank is to maintain price
stability. So for that reason with other government bodies we worked on
an anti-inflation plan that might allow us to control inflation from
shooting up to higher levels than we had, say, last year.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
In that plan, basically, we insisted on the importance for Nicaragua of
production. The base of our anti-inflation plan was production. So we
had to ensure that Nicaraguan producers, small, medium or large, but
especially small and medium producers who are the ones that produce
most food in Nicaragua should be able to bring to market in Nicaragua
beans, maize and those products which are the basic components of
ordinary people's domestic economy.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
We have made steady progress towards that. If you study our national
reality, you can see that in July, August and September, we have had a
real impact on the rhythm of inflation with important results. But here
now we have a problem, we have to make clear.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Namely that the current heavy rains are going to have an objective
effect on national production. What is that impact? We still don't
know. But we think it is inevitable there will be one. We are certainly
going to have less production than forecast. And that was the base of
our anti-inflation plan.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : You have mentioned that the main objective of the Nicaraguan
Central bank is to guarantee price stability. That is very similar to
the mandate of the European Central Bank. The United States on the
other hand has a central bank institution, the Federal Reserve which
also has the responsibility of promoting full employment. What are your
thoughts on that issue here in Nicaragua?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : That is a discussion that has both defenders and detractors. What
is the main function of a Central Bank. Some argue that it ought to be
exclusively the control of prices. Others argue that it should have
other objectives, as in the case you mention of the Federal Reserve,
because they do indeed have a role in promoting full employment. It
seems to me that the fundamentally important thing, even in the United
States, is faced with this financial problem, to control inflation. And
in fact in Nicaragua we are bound by the law as it stands and the
Central Bank has as its basic objective to control inflation. So we
would need a legal change that might lead to that matter of promoting
employment being another of the main tasks of the Central Bank. So for
now we do not foresee a proposal to that effect making the Central Bank
responsible for promoting employment.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : Staying with the issue of inflation. From mid 2007 the European
Central Bank has injected liquidity energetically&nbsp; and from
December 2007 the Federal reserve has opened various facilities also
making available huge amounts of liquidity to their financial system.
But even these measures have been superseded lately by coordinated
measures at a global level to supply the global financial system with
unprecedented amounts of liquidity. Do you and your colleagues not fear
that this phenomenon might generate very complicated inflationary
effects in months to come for regions like Central America.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : Certainly there is going to occur in Nicaragua and Central America
an effect resulting from the international financial situation. But
here we have to decide whether we are going to address the problem of
today or the problem of tomorrow. It looks as though the decision of
the big financial centres is to address today's problems. I think of
today's problems as being a crisis by Cs. There's a Capital crisis, a
Credit crisis, a crisis of Confidence and a crisis of Control. Why?
Because despite the injection of capital you have just described, it is
still not enough. Despite financial entities needing to again receive
funds to capitalize themselves they have not been able to. It is the
State, once more, that is playing that role.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
There is a credit crisis because absolute mistrust exists as regards
the real financial state of all those institutions. The banks don't
want to lend to each other. Obviously that is going to have
repercussions here in Nicaragua. That is beyond doubt. Where might the
international financial situation hurt us? In various ways. I'll
mention a few.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
First, there was a tendency many analysts thought might last for many
years, namely the rise in food prices. That tendency is now downwards.
Nicaragua's main export products are primary products. So that tendency
will certainly have an objective impact on the Nicaraguan economy.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
We have important sources of employment in the free trade zones,
regardless of whether or not we agree with the free trade zone
employment system, regardless of that, objectively, there it is. A
number of Nicaraguans work in those zones. Now then, the main market
for those products produced on out national territory under the free
trade zone regime is the US market. And the data show us very clearly
this year there has been a drop of purchases in retail outlets for the
products we make here by way of clothing and textiles. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
SO a drop in US purchasing power, a drop in consumption in the US
market affects Nicaragua because the maquila companies here.are going
to have a drop in the orders their sales representatives get from the
wholesalers that buy their goods.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
We are going to be affected in the tourist sector. Some people, in
Honduras&nbsp; too, I have read the Tourism Minister there, like our
own, said it was an opportunity because we are going to see a kind of
budget tourism appear now. Someone might say "Perhaps I cannot go
somewhere else but I can choose Nicaragua "...&nbsp; that's possible
but one has to look hard at the reality because it looks the way things
are going&nbsp; that person&nbsp; won't have the resources to go
anywhere, even for budget tourism. There is a great&nbsp; deal of&nbsp;
uncertainty now. I am talking about the ordinary person, the ordinary
citizen. So in tourism as well we could see things notably affected.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Let's talk too about foreign investment. How might one have a problem
with foreign investment? In the sense that, in situations like this
one, the capitalist system exacerbates the contradictions of the most
needy and so, just as Nicaragua is a very impoverished country, there
are a load of poor countries that could take measures to attract
investment. And we know at what cost attracting that investment has to
be done and Nicaragua is not necessarily going to be among the first
places investors may want to come.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
So it's not just whether or not the investor&nbsp; wants to come here
but the competition the same countries in need of that investment&nbsp;
engage in for that investment to come. Except of course, obviously,
when we have a type of investment or trade adjusted to other criteria,
like fair trade for example, or South-South investment.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
But that is another thing we have not developed as much as we might
although we have as horizon the importance of export diversification.
But we are not right now going to diversify exports overnight. It is
not true that overnight we are going to say about the free trade zone
products or other exports, "no, those aren't all going North, now we'll
send 50% somewhere else...."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Another problem that is certainly going to be affected - and I am not
giving any of these in any special order - is linked to national banks
financing from foreign banks. Somewhat. But also the finance from
foreign banks to national producers. Because not all businesses based
in Nicaragua fund themselves with resources from our own financial
system. Some do so directly&nbsp; with foreign banks because they get
cheaper interest rates. So&nbsp; the continuity&nbsp; of lines of
credit entered into directly between those institutions and our banks
and between those institutions and our companies cold be reduced. In
fact they have been reduced.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Right now we are talking, at least with the most important companies in
Nicaragua, so as to know what their obligations are and with the banks
too to know what their short term obligations are that they all have to
pay to those foreign banks and how their lines of credit are behaving.
We are in daily contact because you can imagine what it would mean if
one of these international banks suddenly decided to suspend a line of
credit to one of our national banks.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
And lastly, but not less important for that one has to explain that
this situation will see us competing strongly also for international
cooperation. We are going to be competing for investment. But we are
also going to be competing for international cooperation. Why? Because
to some degree we have, let's say some difficulties in relation to some
other countries. we cannot receive funds that are not concessionary
funds because we are members of the HIPC initiative for highly indebted
poor countries.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
And obviously that makes if difficult for us to get funds on
non-concessionary terms that many countries, most western hemisphere
countries can have access to at the moment. Whether its from the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) or the Latin American Reserve
Fund (FLAR) or the Financial Investment Corporation who have announced
amounts of almost US$10 billion available for emerging countries and in
this case the Latin American Countries with the IADB.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
But there you are, one has to remember that in the Americas there are
giants, one might say, like Brazil, Mexico, Argentina. And when they go
to access that credit, they do so but it is not the same for Nicaragua
or Honduras or Guyana. So there are some difficulties that are
objectively present on the international financial scene that's despite
instruments like the IADB in theory being our banks for&nbsp;
facilitating development. So all that means we are looking very
attentively and with much concern at developments in the international
financial situation.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS :&nbsp; Has the mistrust between banks caused any significant
problems in the national banking system so far?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : Among other things one would have to say that mistrust&nbsp;
between banks in those rich countries comes about in proportion to the
development of the inter-bank markets. For example the loans between
banks made to be able to ensure liquidity for the following day and so
forth. In our case the inter-bank market is very small and I think our
main concern right now is to conserve the lines of credit our national
banks receive from international funds. That is our fundamental worry.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Because remember that the rules that typify that capitalist financial
world are different from the ones that result from relations with
another type of State or with countries having a different vision, like
solidarity, fair trade, a vision towards integration and so on. Because
there in the capitalist system the great majority of lines of credit
stipulate that they can be rescinded at any moment. You have no
guarantee they are going to be on offer for ever. If there is any
weakness in country risk, a weakening in the index of country risk or
is they consider your cash flow is going to be affected or whatever
other reason, that'll be enough to demand you give them their money
back.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : Do you see any chance here in the region or in Latin America
generally the possibility that some country or group of countries might
do the same as Ireland was the first to do and guarantee all deposits,
something it was heavily criticized for?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR :&nbsp; It was criticized but they immediately turned round and did
the same! Even the Euro countries did after Ireland did so. But they
did it differently. Because Spain said, "No, that doesn't suit me, I'm
putting up more..." To give one example. Iceland said it would
guarantee all deposits. Germany will probably do the same as did Greece
and Portugal.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
So here what we are watching are the contradictions of the capitalist
system. Because what one is trying to make out are positions. here one
sees US financial capital&nbsp; fighting against European financial
capital. We cannot deny that. Prime Minister Brown's had one position
to start with and now it's different. And the positions of Sarkozy and
of Berlusconi are different in relation to Germany's position.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Here what we are seeing is that a genuinely coordinated strategy does
not exist. That's why the annual meeting of the IMF and the
International Financial and Monetary Council ordered a revitalization
of the IMF, ordering it to play a better role in establishing a
genuinely coordinated policy because capitalism as a system now
requires that coordination because otherwise we are just going to have
what we have always had : the struggle between different capital for
hegemony.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : Might something similar happen in Latin America?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR :&nbsp; I think the major Latin American powers will propose&nbsp; a
new design of international financial architecture.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS :&nbsp; And the Bank of the South?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : Not just the Bank of the South . Because right now for example,
Brazil, India and South Africa are in a meeting. President Lula is
there, demanding a new design of that architecture. Zoellick has
clearly said the seven countries are no longer enough, we need 14 now .
Let's include Brazil, Mexico, Russia as a full member, South Africa,
China and India. Why? Because the system needs it and they too need it,
a change. It is no longer possible to run international finance the way
its has been managed up&nbsp; until now, that model of absolute
deregulation.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
And Sarkozy said a couple of days ago and said again yesterday that we
need to regulate entities like hedge funds. Because that is part of the
crisis, the crisis of control by the State. So I think we are
approaching a position in which everything will be different.
International finance is going to change. Now that absolutist vision
that the United States were the only ones allowed to drive
international finance policy, the way things are going I don't think
that will return in the next few years</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : Returning to the matters here in Nicaragua, at a trade level,
have you and your colleagues found any problems for the bigger
companies with regard to letters of credit or other mechanisms for
essential for facilitating trade.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : That's one of the issues we are researching with those companies
quite deeply so as to understand what is the real impact on their lines
of credit&nbsp; but apart from that, basically,&nbsp; and independently
of the current crisis, over the last few months we have begun to pay
much more attention to a problem becoming clearer in Nicaragua which is
the growth of consumer credit. One example can illustrate the problem.
If we have a drop in the sales of produce from the free trade zones that
we export to the US that could lead to unemployment in the free trade
zones. Have you any idea of the proportion of workers in the free trade
zones with credit cards.? It is extremely high. What might happen to
those workers who have been given credit cards is that they will not be
able to pay it because they will be out of work.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
So the policy of increasing consumption has been a concern of ours all
through 2008. The Bank Superintendent's office and other financial
institutions even issued a prudential notice aimed at strengthening
credit for production. We think it is very, very important, obviously
that Nicaragua has credit for production so as to drive greater levels
of competitiveness in Nicaragua and thus its productivity. But th
rhythm of consumer credit we have is a menace to Nicaraguans' capacity
to pay.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : So in Nicaragua the same phenomenon exists of predatory loans
being made even though it is clear the recipients are unlikely to be
able to pay....</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : That phenomenon does indeed exist given that the profit level
obtainable in that market mean one can accept as a lender&nbsp; a high
level of non-performance so as to achieve a level of returns
satisfactory&nbsp; for the business plan those lenders use.&nbsp; But
more than anything right now it seems to me we need to be very
attentive to international developments, very attentive to credit
policies and very concerned about strengthening Nicaragua's position at
a very difficult time.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
You touched on the issue a moment ago of what should be the policy to
guarantee deposits in Central America. We have already done some
calculations and in practice the US$10,000 guarantee we have now covers
very many of Nicaragua's depositors. And that is the main problem. What
is that deposit guarantee fund able to protect. And here we are not
talking about protection wholesale for protection's sake. We are
already familiar with that policy of protecting all deposits 100%.
rather what we want here is protection so as to ensure stability and
confidence. Problems of confidence or systemic problems in the national
banks would not be helpful to this government of&nbsp; Unity and
National Reconciliation.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
But now it does not just depend on us because everything is too
interconnected. All the Nicaraguan banks, practically all, have a
presence at a Central American level. And it is absolutely guaranteed
that if a problem happens in another country here, that is going to
have repercussions in Nicaragua. And it the problem happens in
Nicaragua, it will have repercussions in Central America. So the most
important thing here is to guarantee the stability of the financial
system, to regulate prudently, to improve regulation of the financial
system by the Nicaraguan authorities. We have to play a very active,
strong role, determined to protect the national interest and even more
so at a time as complicated as the present.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : Changing the subject a bit. Presumably relations with the IMF are
very important for you and your colleagues. I understand you had
another meeting with them recently.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : We went to the annual meeting of the IMF. The President of
Nicaragua's Central Bank exercises governorship in relations with the
IMF. So we went to talk to them in a meeting with all the world's
Finance Ministers and central bank presidents because that meeting is
also a meeting of the World Bank. And we took advantage of the occasion
to discuss with the IMF officials the establishment of a contingency
line of credit in case Nicaragua needs help with its balance of
payments, so as to protect our reserves if problems present themselves.
And the IMF officials clearly understood that should that eventuality
occur then rapid disbursement mechanisms would be necessary so that we
would not have to be going through the whole process that generally
characterizes that kind of disbursement.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
So I think the visit was very positive for the Nicaraguan Central Bank,
because it has allowed us to agree with the IMF that if a special
situation arose we could get an increase of the current quota our
country has within the framework of the Service, growth and Poverty
Reduction quota that could be up to US$80million more, if we need it,
only should we require it.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
And secondly, we managed to set a date for the second programme review
that will happen in November when the IMF will visit. So I see those as
very positive results of that meeting.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS&nbsp; Does the approval of the IMF&nbsp; help Nicaragua in its
relations with other international bodies?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR :&nbsp; Look, to be honest, we have always maintained and with them
too that while what you say is true, in the sense that many people
seeing that we are in a programme with the IMF,&nbsp; the IMF has good
relations with us and in so far as we reach certain agreements is is
important for other relations, we have always maintained that these
relations should be separate.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
That is not easy, because some actors for sure want to deal with us on
the basis that only if we have a programme with the IMF will they talk
to us and release funds. A few. Not everyone. Because most of them
understand that what is important for Nicaragua is to guarantee its
macro-economic stability, to maintain healthy&nbsp; financial policies,
spending controls and good results in poverty reduction so as to
continue the cooperation that historically we have received.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
So we are always somewhat firm on that matter. But realities sometime
impose themselves. In fact when we have a programme with the IMF to
some extent we find fewer difficulties in maintaining relations towards
the things we want, which are investment, cooperation and increasing
the country's productive capacity.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS :&nbsp; Going back to the issue of macro-economic stability, the
case of the CENIs you mentioned at the outset has been very
controversial. The Central Bank and the government have managed to
stabilize the situation via a negotiation with the bank's concerned. Do
you think that is a closed chapter now or could it again become
problematic in future as the case being prosecuted by the Public
Prosecutor's office unfolds?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : From the point of view of the Central Bank the so called CENIs
case only need the approval of its Board. Once that has been obtained
then from a financial point of view we can&nbsp; close that page.
Because we think it helps Nicaragua to continue strengthening the
credibility of the Central Bank. And this decision on negotiating the
bank securities, in the Bank's judgement has helped strengthen the
institution. It has helped maintain confidence in the government's
bonds and the bonds of the Central Bank. That obviously has nothing to
do with whatever developments there may be from a judicial perspective
with regard to the authority or attributes to do with their issue or
any other matter that is in doubt.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
For us one can say that with that authorization from the Board we could
say it is a closed chapter for the Central Bank.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : And with regard to the formation of the new Board? Apparently
that is being held up by the National Assembly. To what extent is that
a political problem and to what extent is that&nbsp; problem holding up
the normal work of the Central Bank?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR : At the moment there is a series of functions that only the Board
can carry out, for example approving the Central Bank's budget for
2009. Currently the budget review is not finished because we haven't
been able to adjust some of the line items. Because only the Board can
approve them, monetary policy review, review of legal arrangements. All
these are components that require the presence of the Central Bank's
Board </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
And too, in a situation like this imagine if we had to inject funds
into a bank&nbsp; the way other countries are doing , under normal
circumstances we would require the presence of the Board. Since it is
not active then we have to assume that role and it will be another
story whether we are authorized to do so or not. But for now the
important thing is to manage and cope with whatever difficult case or
problem we are confronted. So I think that yes we do need to get over
that political hurdle because it is in the National Assembly and the
deputies there should proceed with confirming the Board.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : Are you optimistic they will?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR :&nbsp; I think the Central Bank wants to think the deputies are
serious and interested in strengthening its institutions and making
them work. And furthermore it is a commitment we had with the IMF for
September&nbsp; after a discussion, since we should really have done it
beforehand. But we had a discussion and it was put back to September.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS :&nbsp; Obviously the international crisis has created a series of
unforeseen challenges. Were it not for the crisis, what would have been
your&nbsp; and your colleagues priorities in the Central Bank over the
next couple of years?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR :&nbsp; Our objective, our task and main function is keeping prices
stable. That is a task to which we must pay great attention. Only via
strict coordination with government policy between government and the
Central Bank and with support across Nicaraguan society is it possible
to achieve anti-inflationary objectives in Nicaragua. According to
studies the Bank's technical officials have carried out, a large
percentage of Nicaragua's inflation stems from inflationary
expectations. Or in other words what people believe inflation will be
is transmitted directly to the cost of products and services </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
So that can only be resolved through confidence, security via the
transmission of that security and confidence in anti-inflationary
policy not just from the government but&nbsp; through other economic
agents and operators so it translates into a feeling among the
citizenry, among the population diminishing those expectations to what
one might call normal levels in a society as complicated as ours here
in Nicaragua.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
TcS : A final question, how relevant is the Bank of the South or the
proposed ALBA bank?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
AR :&nbsp; We have been working a lot on the ALBA bank. In fact, I can
tell you&nbsp; the Bank of the South is an opportunity, an alternative
for us to really make sure&nbsp; the resources we Latin American
countries have and which we can obtain do in fact go into our
development. In the case of the ALBA bank, which is a project closer to
us, one of Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia,&nbsp; and Nicaragua&nbsp; we are
waiting for the ratification of the agreement to found the bank. And we
have pending a meeting of the people responsible for the bank. We had
envisaged it being on September 21st, but for numerous reasons the
finance ministers and myself, the person responsible here for the ALBA
bank, could not agree on a date to make the meeting happen. But it is
more than an interesting alternative, it is important, necessary, vital
to guarantee the development of our peoples.</span><br>
