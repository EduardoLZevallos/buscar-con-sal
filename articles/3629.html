<p><strong>Remarks by General Nikolay Patrushev</strong><br />
<br />
Thank you for this opportunity to speak. Beloved Compañero Comandante, beloved Compañera Rosario, above all I would like to thank you for the warm welcome in this land of Nicaragua.<br />
I would like to thank all the Nicaraguan people, but with special thanks to Compañero Laureano, for his efforts to organize both the Bilateral Meetings and the Multilateral Meetings.<br />
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to convey to you the best wishes of the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin. He pays a lot of attention to the development of our relationship.</p>

<p>The invitation to these Meetings and their realization will give additional impetus to strengthening and intensifying relations between our Countries.</p>

<p>Compañero Laureano has just mentioned the representatives of the Institutions that took part in these Meetings. In our opinion they worked very well and fruitfully, and I hope that we will be able to see results not only in the fields of Security, Defenseand Military-Technical Cooperation, but also in the socioeconomic field.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Meeting between all Five Parties was held which was also very fruitful. This was  the second such Meeting and everyone expressed the opinion that it was very successful.<br />
We will continue the work in this format, but we will also develop our work in other formats. For example, the Meeting of the High Representatives for Security Affairs will be held in St. Petersburg from April 23rd to 25th.</p>

<p>We held the first Meeting of this kind last year in the Moscow Region, when 101 Countries participated at that time; I hope that this time we will manage to bring together even more participants interested in cooperating.</p>

<p>During the Meetings, each side expressed interest in the development of cooperation in the field of Information Security, and this topic will be one of the main issues we will address in St. Petersburg in April.</p>

<p>Our counterparts also expressed interest in addressing the issue of traditional values, and this issue will also be addressed within the framework of the April Meeting.</p>

<p>Many companies, many institutions are going to participate in this event, especially in the field of Security and Defense, different presentations will be made. We are also going to show our guests the sights of St. Petersburg, and I hope that our work will be very fruitful.</p>

<p>This year your country is celebrating the 45th Anniversary of the Sandinista Popular Revolution and you, Compañero Comandante, were one of the Leaders, and we congratulate you for that.</p>

<p>However for our Peoples to live in Security, and for Sovereignty and Independence to be preserved, we must pay close attention, on a permanent basis, to these issues.</p>

<p>Our Nicaraguan Friends informed us, once again, about the events that took place in 2018, and these acts must not be repeated.</p>

<p>Today we visited the Training Center of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and I think it is very useful, not only for Nicaragua, but for other Latin American Countries and for our Country as well.</p>

<p>One more important issue that we will address is Biological safety.</p>

<p>We also know that the MECHNIKOV Joint Venture operates in Nicaragua, where the Russian Federal Medical-Biological Agency operates, and the operation of this Center is very effective.<br />
The creation of a Nuclear Medicine Center, under the direction of the ROSATOM Company, is also not far away, and I believe that this would also be very effective.</p>

<p>It is very important to note that the Meetings were held not only between the Delegations representing the Forces Institutions, but also the Representatives of the economic bloc. They had very fruitful meetings and we hope that all the Agreements reached can be implemented soon.</p>

<p>We cannot slow down the pace of the development of our relationships. As far as I recall, this year we are celebrating 80 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries.<br />
That is why, Compañero President, Compañera Vice-President, I thank you for the hospitality, the warm welcome and the work carried out; I hope we will be able to continue working, cooperating, on a regular basis, both in the bilateral format and in the multilateral format. And you also just mentioned our cooperation at the UN, where we support each other. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Words of Daniel</strong></p>

<p>Beloved Compañero Nikolay Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation; Beloved Brothers and Sisters of the Russian Government Delegation and your leader President Putin, to whom we send our greetings, do tell him that we always remember his visit to Nicaragua, a historic visit. We greet the Russian Delegation, the Russian People, on behalf of the Nicaraguan people, who continue to strive for peace.</p>

<p>This Meeting, on which Compañero Patrushev has already informed us in detail about the issues that were addressed, is a Meeting for Development, for the fight against Poverty, for the Security of our Peoples. It's a meeting for Peace!</p>

<p>We cannot ignore the crimes that are being committed in the world right now. These are crimes committed by States, by governments that are well known for attacking, invading, even dropping atomic bombs on defenseless cities.</p>

<p>They are Nations calling themselves democratic andwho want to give us lessons in democracy, when they have a history of carrying out colonialist practices against the Peoples of the World; Nations whose criminal record includes setting up the business of slave trafficking; Nations with Leaders who have no shame and who with the utmost cynicism try to justify the crimes they have committed throughout history.</p>

<p>We already know the interest that is the motive behind these crimes: the interest of seizing the wealth of Peoples, of Developing Nations. They call themselves “human rights defenders" when they have been the greatest violators of Human Rights in the History of Humanity, and pay no attention to the damage being done to Planet Earth and the damage they are doing to their own Peoples.</p>

<p>Because they want to reinstall and strengthen Nazism not only in Ukraine, but also in Europe, where the doors through which Hitler walked to take power in Germany are open again. Yes, in Europe people are progressing who follow the thought, the logic and the path of terror that Fascism imposed on the German people and the Peoples of the World.</p>

<p>In other words, the United Nations has been impotent, because it simply does not have the correlation among the Nations represented there to allow the Principles of the United Nations to be fulfilled. The interests of the Fascists, the Nazists, the Imperialists are imposed in the United Nations.</p>

<p>Thus we see in Ukraine, whose People have been a victim of Fascism, of Nazism, already in earlier times, how following the defeat of Fascism, of Nazism, in which the Russian People was decisive in the Victory against Nazism, we see how they unite in NATO, Europe and the United States to defend Nazism, while the Government, the Russian people, the Russian soldiers, are waging the battle against Nazism in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Now we are even hearing European Presidents, the President of France, the France that murdered millions of Human beings in Algeria and other Peoples whose land they occupied, openly talking about bringing troops from Europe, and they also want American troops, so as  to defend Nazism in Ukraine.</p>

<p>And as if the crimes that already being committed were not enough, we have too that other reality, bloody, brutal, painful, where the Government of Israel, with the military backing of the United States and European countries is determined to make the Palestinian People disappear.</p>

<p>We see the crimes via direct broadcasts, how they kill children, victims of the Zionist bombings, how they destroy homes, how they destroy hospitals, how they have said very clearly, the Prime Minister of Israel has said, that Palestine must disappear.</p>

<p>There are protests of course, the Peoples protest, the People of Israel itself does not agree, the whole People of Israel, with these crimes; Peoples in Europe march and protest; Rulers, Latin American, Caribbean Peoples, have also condemned the crimes, except naturally the Fascist Governments that we already have in Latin America, Fascist Governments, Nazi Governments, who feel very confident, without taking into account the Conscience of their Peoples. Because the Peoples’ conscience is being built up against these crimes, and against the Governments that promote and participate in these crimes.</p>

<p>The blood spilled in Palestine and the blood spilled in Ukraine is blood that is spilled as a result of the fascist, Nazi attitude of the governments grouped in NATO.</p>

<p>These are policies that differ in nothing, in nothing at all, nothing, from the practice of that politician of German origin, Adolf Hitler, who came to government and then set out to occupy those self-same European Peoples.</p>

<p>We are facing what is an attempt by World Capitalism, Imperialism, to reimplant Fascism, Nazism, not only in Europe, not only in Ukraine, but also in our Latin American and Caribbean Countries.</p>

<p>Earlier these crimes did not attract attention enabling the corresponding steps to be taken at the United Nations so as to stop the war Europe has launched against the Russian Federation and the war they have launched against the Palestinian People, the United Nations has no mechanism, words are exhausted there, to the point of being ridiculous while its votes are mocked.</p>

<p>After all, on how many occasions have all the Countries that are Members of the United Nations voted to lift the blockade on Cuba, the Cuba of Martí, of Fidel, of Raúl? Year after year. And they vote massively in favor, only two or three countries do not vote in favor, but democracy has no value, the votes have no value, because instead the blockade simply intensifies.</p>

<p>The same thing has happened against our Sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and is still happening, the Land of Bolivar, which inspired Sandino, the Land of Chávez. And, so much effort President Nicolás Maduro has made to reach understanding, agreement, but suddenly just when it seems that those agreements, those understandings are going to be reached, more aggression is unleashed.</p>

<p>Our solidarity with the Bolivarian People, our Solidarity with the People of Cuba, with President Miguel Díaz Canel, who have accompanied this meeting. To them, our Affection, our Brotherly Embrace. Because Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and our Older Sister, the Russian Federation, have all participated in this Meeting.</p>

<p>As our Brother Patrushev recalled, we are in the 45th Year of the Triumph of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, which is the expression of the Conscience of a People, the Nicaraguan People, who after confronting the Spanish colonialists, even defeating them in the first encounters with the Cacique Diriangén, after Nicaragua was occupied by the Spanish Empire, in the end, the Independence of Spain, of our Peoples, accompanied by the gigantic battles that Bolivar fought and which favored the Independence of Central America, and the gigantic battles that Mexico also fought, with Hidalgo, with Juárez. Two countries that fought their battles.</p>

<p>And we here in Central America fighting the same battle, of course without the power of two big nations like Mexico, finally achieving Independence, the Independence of Central America in the year 1821. On from1831, 1841, to 1851, just 30 years after Independence the Yankees were already intervening in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The Yankee Empire fell on Nicaragua, why? For the Canal. Yes, there is no oil here, but there is that strategic route, the Canal route, and the Yankees set upon Nicaragua, imposing on us a President, William Walker, who was recognized by the United States Government at that time.</p>

<p>The plan was to take all of Central America and then advance on Mexico, but Nicaragua’s Patriots rebelled against the invaders, and fought the invaders even with stones, like Andrés Castro, and the people of Nicaragua managed to defeat the first Yankee attempt to seize Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Then came the second Yankee attempt in which they overthrew a government because it held progressive, Liberal positions, and did not lend itself to being an instrument of the Yankees. They defeated President Zelaya. But the Nicaraguans again rebelled out of patriotism and with the same Spirit of the San Jacinto Fighters who faced Walker, this time with General Benjamin Zeledón at the head, and around this time Zeledón was fighting the first battles just as the Yankee troops were landing here in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Then Zeledón fell in combat against the Yankee troops, and Sandino who was a boy at the time took up Zeledón's flag, and continued the combat against the Yankee troops, and Sandino managed to defeat the Yankee troops. Faced with their defeat, the Yankees left behind military officers of the US Army to lead Somoza’s National Guard.</p>

<p>And when Sandino came here to Managua, when the Peace Accords were already being signed, then Sandino was assassinated. And he was assassinated after President Sacasa, who was a man of good intentions, invited him to dinner at the Presidential House. The Peace Accords had already been signed, there were no longer any Yankee troops in Nicaragua, but the United States’ plan was to assassinate Sandino and they took him when he was returning from the Presidency, and shot him along with other Heroes, with other Patriots.</p>

<p>Well, the battle was a long one, because Somoza was the Governor the Yankees installed here in Nicaragua, and they gave him arms, because for them he was a Democrat. But the Nicaraguan people rebelled, as ever; always in rebellion against the Yankee invaders, against the US troops that Zeledón fought, that Sandino fought, and then those that the Nicaraguan people fought with the Sandinista National Liberation Front at their head.</p>

<p>We are in the 45th year of the defeat of Yankee Imperialism in Nicaragua, which is why they continue to conspire, attacking us in various ways and planning all kinds of crimes, crimes of which the Peoples, all the Peoples and their Governments that have been participating in this Meeting are victims. Hence, to ensure on the one hand the defeat of Fascism, the defeat of Nazism, the defeat of those with policy of destruction and death against the Palestinian People, Unity is the Way, Unity through addressing issues such as these that have been addressed at this Meeting.</p>

<p>We have not come here to discuss plans to invade the United States, or to move against NATO, or to move against the Government of Israel. No! We have come here to work on a plan to defend our Peoples so that our Peoples have the opportunity to overcome poverty, achieve better socioeconomic development. Justice and Solidarity are the Principles that have brought us together during these days here in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>We have gathered to continue striving for Peace, because no matter how hard the current situation is given what is happening, on the part of NATO attacking the Palestinian People, attacking the People of Ukraine and threatening the Russian Federation; in the end, we have the certainty, we have the conviction, we have the confidence that Peace will defeat Fascism, Peace will defeat Neo-Fascism, Peace will defeat Imperialism.</p>

<p>And we feel strengthened by this event, this Meeting, it is historic here in our country, where the Russian Federation together with Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, convened us all to meet here in Managua, in the Land of Sandino and on the 45th Anniversary of the overthrow of the last Yankee marine.<br />
<br />
Thank you, thank you.</p>
