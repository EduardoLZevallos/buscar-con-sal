<p><strong>Address by Daniel</strong><br />
<br />
Good evening, Brothers and Sisters, families of Nicaragua, today, on this day in which we commemorate our brother Carlos, Carlos Fonseca, on the day of his birth, while he is in another space, but he is present here. Present among the Nicaraguan People, Present in the Soul of the Peasants, the Workers, Nicaragua’s Youth, Present in the Spirit of Struggle to defend Peace, the Police and the Army.<br />
<br />
These are times when it is clear that the most important thing to take care of is Peace, because war, violence, interventions, aggression are multiplying in a great part of our planet, and there are Regions where People are even being massacred, Peoples are being destroyed, such as the Palestinian People, a Heroic People, who continue to resist, continue to defend their Right to Life, their Right to have a Home.<br />
<br />
And then we hear about nuclear armaments. Nuclear armaments are a weapon, there were commitments in the United Nations so that there would be no nuclear weapons, but the Imperialists of the Earth, who have the capacity and the resources, to build nuclear weapons, have built them, and they do not allow other countries to build nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
How they burst out in fury when the President of North Korea announced that they would not stand idly by in the face of an aggression; because they are constantly surrounded, threatened, by the weapons of the US Army.<br />
<br />
And the Republic of which he is President is a small nation, a small territory, the territory of Iran and the population of Iran are much more immense, there are more than 90 million inhabitants in Iran. And  North Korea has been clear in saying, if we are attacked we will not hesitate to respond with the nuclear weapons that we have. Because they have nuclear weapons, they have managed to build them under difficult conditions, and that makes them untouchable.<br />
<br />
That is to say, it seems that in the World so that no Country can be attacked, sanctioned, invaded, bombed, every country should have nuclear weapons, nuclear missiles, such that no one would dare, no one would dare mount an attack, an aggression. But the way forward is not to multiply nuclear weapons in the world.<br />
 </p>

<p>We have declared Latin America a Zone of Peace and also one free of this type of weaponry, and the challenge that humanity has, the challenge that the Imperialists of the Earth have, above all, is to start destroying their nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Only by disappearing nuclear weapons can there be Peace and Security in the World; otherwise, all peoples are threatened and blackmailed when an imperialist Power dares to launch bombings, when a Country is not at war, to destroy the laboratories that were working on in Iran, under the inspection of the International Organization of the United Nations.</p>

<p>For what? To make sure that Iran's Program was a Program, as they have explained, of development in the nuclear field, but for peaceful uses. Because in many Countries there are Nuclear Energy Plants and they are very safe, very stable and the cost is also the lowest when it comes to generating electricity, and that's what they were inspecting there.<br />
<br />
And after they launched the bombs on the points where the laboratories were supposed to be, it turns out that all this is theater; because the President who orders the rockets to be launched does so in order to help the Government of Israel. Because at the same time, the Government of Israel, which has nuclear weapons, does not accept to be inspected, and no one inspects it.<br />
<br />
And what is the United Nations for after all? What is the United Nations for? Nothing at all! Nothing at all! Because no matter how much people talk at the United Nations about reaching agreements at the United Nations, they are not fulfilled. Ah, but if the Agreement is to attack a country, then that one is indeed fulfilled. If the Agreement is to invade, bomb, destroy Libya, that Agreement is fulfilled, as when they assassinated our Brother Muammar Gaddafi.<br />
<br />
But when the majority Agreements there demand that the blockade of Cuba be suspended after 63 years, in a vote where practically everyone votes in favor of suspending the blockade of Cuba; there are two, three countries, Israel and the United States, that do not agree, they vote against.<br />
<br />
It is of no use that the vast majority of the Peoples of the world vote there in favor of suspending the blockade on Cuba, because simply nothing happens there, and the blockade instead is intensified, and that causes suffering for the People of Cuba, a Heroic People, the People of Martí, the People of Fidel, of Raúl, of our Brother Díaz-Canel at the front, fighting a Heroic, a Heroic, a truly Heroic Battle.<br />
 </p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/426509.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p>It is a brutal blockade, where they are left without Energy, they are left without the ability to acquire spare parts to be able to put the power plants to work. A total, brutal blockade! And what do the United Nations say? They vote, everyone votes there, everyone votes, but there are no conditions there, in the United Nations, for what the United Nations or its Agencies vote for to be fulfilled.</p>


<p>The United States owes us many millions in compensation after the war imposed on us by President Ronald Reagan, which caused thousands of deaths here in Nicaragua, murdered young men and women, peasants, humble working people. Armed and trained by the United States, funded by the United States.</p>

<p>It was from ‘79 to ‘90 an uninterrupted war, which was fought from the heart really, because we were a Revolution that had an Army and a Police Force, that they were only getting organized when the onslaught of the Yankee Empire began.</p>

<p>And we went to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which is an Instrument of the United Nations, such that what the Court says is supposed to be fulfilled. And the Court ruled condemning the United States for terrorist activities against the Nicaraguan people, and ordered them to pay compensation. And to this date they have not paid compensation.</p>

<p>That is to say, it is becoming clearer every day that there are a number of Organizations in the United Nations that serve no more than as instruments of Empire, to choke the throat, the neck, of those Peoples who are fighting for Sovereignty, for Well-being, for Peace, and that, all the rest is theater, total  theater, as if mocking the world’s Peoples.</p>

<p>Father Miguel d’Escoto, when he was president of the United Nations on behalf of Nicaragua, he raised a Proposal there, a Banner, that the UN had to be rebuilt, that it would have to be refounded... Refounded... what does that mean? It means doing away with the foundations, with the foundations that the United Nations has right now, that those who maintain those foundations are the world’s prevailing Powers.</p>

<p>So it would be necessary to take that power away from those Powers, such that the power may be given to all Peoples, to all Nations, and so in that way then the United Nations would make sense.</p>

<p>The United Nations is simply a mockery to the world’s Peoples, a mockery to humanity. The United Nations should disappear, disappear completely! And that presents the challenge of building with the foundations of the world’s Peoples, with the Strength of all Peoples, of all Nations, a League of Nations in which the Imperialists of the Earth will doubtless not want to join; because they want International Institutions at their service, drawing up Resolutions to punish, assassinate, attack, those Peoples who defend their Sovereignty, defend their Right to Prosperity, to Well-being.</p>

<p>These are times that are not new in the history of humanity, they are not new, involving the powerful, the Imperialists of all times. It is enough to remember that two World Wars originated in Europe, and that the Second War, led by the Nazis, by Hitler, who was going all over Europe, and was going to take over the world and disappear those citizens who did not have the Aryan gene in their blood, because they said that those who were not Aryan had to disappear, had to go to the gas chamber.</p>

<p>That is, if they had come to dominate these Nations, these Peoples, well, off to the gas chamber, simply because they are brown, let alone black. To the gas chamber. Because for them it was only the Aryan race that counted.</p>

<p>And in order to dominate all of Europe and beyond, they launched themselves against Russia, and Russia faced up to them, defeated them. And this year has been a year for celebrating one more anniversary of the defeat of Nazism.</p>

<p>Hitler had his scientists, not to build nuclear missiles, because at that time nuclear weapons were not known, but to build nuclear bombs; they had their scientists working hard there, and he was sure that with nuclear bombs being launched everywhere there would be no Country and Nation that would not surrender.</p>

<p>Well, Hitler was defeated by the Red Army and by the army of that Great Nation that Mao Tse-Tung founded and where President Xi Jinping now is. Hitler was defeated by the People, the Workers, the Soldiers, of Russia and under the leadership of that Great Leader, Joseph Stalin.</p>

<p>Stalin managed to defeat the Nazis, and immediately after the defeat of the Nazis, the US ran to find German scientists to take them to work the bomb. This was in '45, after the war was over, they took them to the United States, and together with US scientists, well, they made some little bombs there. The war had already passed, it was already over.</p>

<p>And in the year 1945, in the first days of August, they decided to go and test the bombs, at that time there were no missiles, they had to carry the bombs, loading them on the planes and then dropping them on the targets. They had targeted two Cities in Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Anniversary is coming now in August. There they dropped the nuclear bombs, the first and only nuclear bombs that have been exploded on any population in all history.</p>

<p>Another one who is tempted to drop nuclear bombs is the current President of the United States, although he talks about Peace, however on the other hand he issues threats.</p>

<p>But the only two atomic bombs that have been exploded in the world, the United States exploded them, and there were 325,000 killed with those bombs.<br />
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not military targets, and there part the population was left, a part of the population was killed, and the population that was not killed was contaminated by radiation, and children began to suffer from cancer and thousands of diseases, adults too, and many people began to die from radiation. And to this day still in Hiroshima and Nagasaki there remains proof, the living traces of descendants of families who are affected by radiation.</p>

<p>And it is incredible to listen to the Imperialists of the Earth, who do not condemn these facts, they do not condemn them; rather, the Europeans have rushed to find how to arm themselves with missiles. Ah, it seems they have that right.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/426584.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p>If it occurred to us to look for a few missiles so that they wouldn't touch us, although nobody touches us here anymore with missiles, that's just how it is. But it does not occur to us, because we are not Peoples to fall into the game and the use of nuclear armament.</p>

<p>No one even knows how this war started by Israel will end. From one day to the next it launched attacks against Iran, with the story that in Iran they were operating those laboratories, but which were of Nuclear Energy for peaceful purposes. They said no, they were for nuclear missiles. And the specialists of Agencies that have visited them, who have gone to inspect the places, said that there was no sign that they were there building bombs or missiles, but that it was for peaceful purposes.</p>

<p>But Israel, which has nuclear missiles, doesn't even want to think that Iran can have them, because it already imagines that Iran is going to launch missiles at them; so it has preferred to start attacking Iran first. It does not launch the nuclear missiles, because it knows that if they launch those missiles, Israel would be committing a crime and falling into a crime that would be condemned,since no government wants to support them in launching nuclear missiles, with nuclear material.</p>

<p>So, what Israel did was to start a war of attrition and persist in attacking, attacking, attacking, attacking, attacking... This was obviously done in agreement with the US government.</p>

<p>To the degree that they attacked, Iran also responded, that is, the law gives them the right to defense; the attacks started from Israel every day, then Iran had to start responding to them as well. And Israel began feeling how the bombs coming from Iran through these modern devices, modern instruments of war, were causing them a lot of damage, so they told the U.S. government to go on and finish off the places where the missiles were being worked on in Iran.</p>

<p>And they did, in the end they set out and organized an operation with a number of planes and bombed the sites, effectively, where the laboratories were. When they bombed the places where the laboratories were, nothing happened, because if there had been uranium there, it would immediately reproduce a thousand times what the Chernobyl accident was, it starts spreading, carried by the winds, and that contaminates with radiation and kills thousands of people for as far as the wind carries it; floating there, but nothing of that happened.</p>

<p>The US government says that they have now destroyed the laboratories, but, on the other hand, it is now known that the laboratories had long ago moved elsewhere, because the Iranians knew that what could come. So, in a way that's a tragicomedy, but really it’s a tragedy, it puts the people of the region in terror, and, on the other hand, they put the world in terror too, and they say they are doing it for Peace.</p>

<p>So, after he had fulfilled the commitment to the Israelis, not to the People of Israel, to the Government, because the People of Israel are a noble People and suffer with all this; when he fulfilled his commitment to the Government of Israel, murderer of the Palestinian People, then the President of the United States came out saying that the problem was already solved, because he had already finished it, and that he had already reached Agreements with the Government of Iran for Peace.</p>

<p>But here is a piece of information where Iran contradicts Trump, because Trump came out saying, as if, I have now complied, I have disrupted them now; so now already let’s cease-fire... The man of peace! But no one pays attention to him there, Netanyahu, the executioner of the Palestinian people, has more power because he continues to launch his explosive devices against Iran.</p>

<p>Of course, Iran has to respond to these attacks as well; and Iran, what has it said? Let Israel cease fire, and we’ll cease fire. Then there would really be conditions to seek understanding and to seek the restoration of Peace in that entire Region.</p>

<p>So far, the truth is that it is difficult to believe the President of the United States, because he constantly says one thing, then says another. Well, those are his characteristics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he is against our Peoples, against the Peoples of our entire Region, the Peoples of Africa, Asia, etc., who have emigrated to the United States, where they have made a family, where they have been given residence, why? Because they are the fundamental workforce allowing this Empire to be sustained economically.</p>

<p>And they are persecuting them, they are hunting them down, they are putting them in prison, because they say they are all bandits, they are all criminals, that they are murderers. How many barbarities has he not said about the Mexican Brothers and Sisters and all the Latin American Brothers and Sisters, as well, bandits he says, murderers, and they are persecuting them.</p>

<p>But there is also a rebellion by the migrants who take to the streets to protest and so they put them in prison, beat them. There in San Francisco, in Los Angeles, there is the greatest resistance. Why? First, because the President of the United States should know that this territory did not belong to the United States, this territory belonged to Mexico since its ancestors.</p>

<p>And then when the emigrants arrived in the United States, they came from England, they came from Europe, and they began to take over the lands of the indigenous Communities in the United States, then they also fell to that entire Region of San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>That is Mexican territory, it is Mexican territory, and deep down, the Mexican Brothers and Sisters feel that, giving battle to defend their right to continue working. Because the police take everything from them, they put them in prison, they go searching through all the workplaces; the police, or the Guard, go into a work center and grab all the workers.</p>

<p>They make no difference there, they grab them and take them away, and then, if a worker who is really a US citizen appears, they release them; but if the others are not from the US , they go to prison and wait to be deported.</p>

<p>They also capture mothers and separate them from their children, it is a real tragedy that is being lived in the United States, against immigrants. And this also affects US companies, because that is the labor they have available, both in agricultural work and in construction work, and work of all kinds.</p>

<p>But there is a persecution without going through lawful procedures, they care little about the Law, he simply decides, this is to be done, and that is to be done. And the judges say no, but he cares very little and goes straight ahead.</p>

<p>Well, that's causing enormous damage to the United States.</p>

<p>And then, the first thing he did was to order to increase tariffs on all Countries in the world, and there are discussions, lawsuits, even with the European community which has been their instrument via NATO, there too they are looking for how to negotiate.</p>

<p>That is to say, these are times when humanity, having so many means, so many instruments to create conditions of Peace, Stability, Progress, Well-being, in the United States itself with all those migrants, and to offer a Policy of Cooperation with all the Countries of the World, and especially with the Developing Countries, does not do so.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the People's Republic of China does, and so they get angry when the People's Republic of China is developing work in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America. They get angry and threaten the governments for accepting the entry of companies from the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p>So, hope lies in these Powers, such as the People's Republic of China, which has a humane, supportive, generous attitude, and that naturally makes it easier for all countries to receive it, and that angers them US Government.</p>

<p>The same thing happens with the Russian Federation, where the Russian Federation comes along and offers cooperation, including cooperation in the field of security, because the Russian Federation has installed a Center here to combat crime, drug trafficking.</p>

<p>It has now been established here in Nicaragua for 12 years, it is a School and they manage it; it is Russian Military Specialists who work at that School, and they have it open for the whole Region and beyond. And from different Central American Countries they come to this School to take courses. The US doesn't like that.<br />
<br />
The most important thing, I think, in these difficult times for so many Peoples, the most important thing is that we have to continue insisting on and make binding the Consciousness that leads us to a defense of Sovereignty and leads us to work for Peace. Because if there is peace,  we can work making progress for the benefit of the People. Work of all kinds that I am not going to list today, because we would be here till daybreak, but public works that are multiplying and reaching the most distant places of our Country.<br />
<br />
Faced with these tribulations provoked by the Imperialists of the Earth, the aggression, well, we bet on Peace... Hopefully, hopefully, the Government of Israel will stop attacking Iran, and then Iran will of course cease fire, and other conditions would open up to be able to reach an Agreement now.<br />

<p>The Israelis didn't want those laboratories in Iran? President Trump has now said that he disappeared them with the bombings he ordered. So where is there, let's say, the brake on things? The brake is the Government of Israel, the Government, not the People of Israel, the Government of Israel, which is the instrument that the Imperialists of the Earth are using to set about seizing the entire region.<br />
<br />
Because it is not only Palestine, they want to take over all those Peoples where there is great wealth, minerals, oil, everything, they want to take over the whole region, without measuring the consequences. Because taking over the whole region is simply not possible, because there are Peoples with History, Brave Peoples,</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Peoples who have fought, Peoples who have suffered, millions of people, in their struggle against the colonialists.</p>

<p>And here in Nicaragua we continue to be united here, with the example of Carlos, Carlos, who gave his life for the Nicaraguan People, for the Peasants; who went into the mountains in difficult conditions when the Guerrillas were totally isolated and were being destroyed.</p>

<p>And with his very thick glasses, because he suffered a myopia that made it difficult for him to see even with those glasses; but he thus took on the challenge of going to join the mountain detachment so that a meeting for Unity would take place there and that Unity would give us more Strength. And he gave his life fighting for Unity.</p>

<p>And in that aspect this is a fundamental point for all of us Nicaraguans, for Youth, for Workers, for the Army, for the Police, Unity, Unity! Because the skills of the enemy look for ways to make us susceptible to sowing distrust, sowing division, speak ill of each other, and so to then cause fractures.</p>

<p>And we must be sure that the more united we are, the stronger we will be, the more united we will be, then we will be guaranteeing peace for the Nicaraguan people. And to guarantee peace for the Nicaraguan people is to guarantee that we continue to make progress with all Social Programs to defeat poverty so that with every day that passes the conditions of Nicaraguan families improve.<br />
<br />
The mission of the People, of all the Institutions, and the fundamental support so this Mission can be developed, where are they? In the Police, in the Army, in the Ministry of the Interior, they are there, and they are administering the measures that we have been taking to avoid so many deaths.</p>

<p>We have to keep track of when we started applying these measures which we are taking to avoid deaths, accidents, on the roads, on the streets our towns. What the average was that we had before, and now we have to take the average from that date, let about 15 more days pass and let's see.</p>

<p>Because here this about saving Lives, and it is about getting us to understand that just because we like to speed, we all like to speed, that's the truth; but how many deaths there are every day, and how much suffering in the Families of those who pass away.</p>

<p>Well then, Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters, Nicaraguan families, on your behalf we are going to take the Legal Oath of Commissioner General Mauricio Lenin Sosa Robelo, Commissioner General Esteban Antonio Torres Rocha, Commissioner General Álvaro José Pérez Marenco, and Commissioner General Oscar José Alemán Marques. And our congratulations to their families, our embrace.</p>

<p>Do you promise, before God, before the Nation, before Nicaragua’s People and Families, before our Heroes and Martyrs, to respect the Constitution, the Laws, the Rights and Freedoms of the People and faithfully fulfill the Missions entrusted, in accordance with the fundamental principles of action of the National Police, to defend the Peace, Security and Stability of our Nation under the Motto of “Honor, Security, Service”?<br />
<br />
<strong>Commissioners General:</strong><br />
Yes, We Promise!<br />
<br />
<strong>Daniel</strong><br />
If you do so, may the Nation and the People recognize you, and if not may they demand against you.<br />
Long live the National Police!<br />
Long live the Nicaraguan Army!<br />
Long live the unity of the whole People!<br />
Long live Peace!<br />
Long live the Comandante in Chief, Father of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, Carlos Fonseca Amador!</p>
