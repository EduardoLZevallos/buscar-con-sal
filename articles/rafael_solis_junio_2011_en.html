            <br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Dr. Rafael Solis was one
              of the lawyers responsible for framing the Constitution of
              1987 and organizing the legal aspects of Nicaragua's first
              transition from one democratically elected government to
              another in 1990. That year, constitutional arrangements
              were complicated by the fact that the elections had been
              brought forward from November to February.</span><br>
            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : Can you tell us about the legal context
            of the Presidential decree of January 2010 that extended the
            periods&nbsp; of office for the magistrates of the Supreme
            Court of Justice and the Supreme Electoral Council?<br>
            <br>
            Rafael Solis : The fundamental thing for all the officials
            in this situation , above all the magistrates of the Supreme
            Electoral Council is that the political Constitution
            established an Article so that until a new magistrate is
            named to replace the previous one whose period of office has
            expired, the current magistrate continues in his position
            indefinitely until a replacement is named.<br>
            <br>
            In this case the National Assembly could not name
            replacements because there weren't the votes. So the
            institutions could not disappear or become tied up or lame
            ducks and so it was sorted out as has been done throughout
            Europe, in that the interpretation of that Constitutional
            article in Nicaragua was oriented to the future as a final
            disposition, not just a transitory one for the moment in
            which the Constitution was applied when there were
            magistrates with their periods expired. <br>
            <br>
            Rather it was for whenever in the future, and the
            magistrates were able to continue in their posts until the
            new magistrates might be named. That's what the second
            clause of Article 201 states and that is the main argument
            of the ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice which left the
            matter clear.<br>
            <br>
            As well as that, there was a decree, No. 3-2010, issued by
            the President of the Republic exercising his functions which
            he issued in the month of January when the National Assembly
            was not in session. He has the power to issue a decree&nbsp;
            and that also ordained in practice that all the officials
            whose periods were to expire in the following months should
            continue in their positions.<br>
            <br>
            So that is is to say there was a Constitutional disposition,
            a decree, a law issued by the President of the Republic that
            is also valid, although of a lower order than the
            Constitution, which obliged all us&nbsp; officials whose
            periods have expired to stay in our posts until the new
            officials are elected. <br>
            <br>
            That is what has been done<br>
            <br>
            Really we are working well. Currently in the Court only one
            magistrate has not returned to work,. That's Dr. Cuaresma.
            The National Assembly..., practically everyone is back
            working and in teh Auditor General of the Republic where
            there was some resistance among the Liberal Controllers,
            there the Liberal Controllers are working. Some left their
            position one day but returned after a couple of weeks. The
            Superintendent of Banks is working with his period expired.
            The Public Prosecutor of the Republic too. <br>
            <br>
            The importance of this&nbsp; debate has been aired publicly
            indicating that we should apply the Constitution and the law
            by continuing in our posts until new officials are elected
            and let's hope that will happen shortly.<br>
