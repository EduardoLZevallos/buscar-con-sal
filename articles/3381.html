<p><strong>MESSAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT<br />
OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY OF NICARAGUA<br />
XIX Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Denis Moncada Colindres<br />
Minister of Foreign Affairs</strong></p>

<p><strong>January 19-20, 2024<br />
Kampala, Uganda</strong></p>

<p>His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta, President of the Republic of Uganda and President of the Non-Aligned Movement.</p>

<p>His Excellency Mr. Ilham Aliyev, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and outgoing President of the Non-Aligned Movement.</p>

<p>Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of State and Government and Heads of Delegations.<br />
<br />
His Excellency General Odongo Jeje Abubakhar, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the countries that integrate the Non-Aligned Movement.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Observers, special guests and members of the press who accompany us at this Meeting.</p>

<p>1. The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of the Republic of Nicaragua transmits a cordial and fraternal greetings from the People of Nicaragua, from our President, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and our Vice President, Compañera Rosario Murillo, to the people and Government of Uganda, to Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government and Heads of Delegation, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation of the Member States of the Non-Aligned Movement present at this Summit.</p>

<p>2. The delegation of Nicaragua wishes to thank the warm attention, kindness and hospitality of the People and Government of Uganda, as well as the efficient coordination and organization for the celebration of this successful Summit.</p>

<p>3. We meet after four years since our last Summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where we committed to continue upholding the Bandung Principles to ensure an adequate response to the challenges of the contemporary world, and as we celebrate this Nineteenth Summit of our Movement, it is important to note that our world continues to face the ideology of domination embraced by Western elites and characterized by the control and manipulation of the international financial world, as well as ideological and cultural perversion, imperialist, unipolar, excluding and racist thinking.</p>

<p>4. This is why the theme of this Summit: “Deepening cooperation for a shared global prosperity”, represents the need to strengthen international solidarity, to join forces and commitments to ensure the progress of our countries in the Global South, by contributing to a new Multipolar World Order, with the rise of new intercontinental regional actors and greater cooperation between developing countries.</p>

<p>5. Multipolarity is the correct response of our Developing Countries to break with imperial hegemony, which for so long has subjected the planet and the majority of the human population to war, environmental collapse, destruction, instability, poverty and hunger.</p>

<p>6. It is based on the principles of mutual respect, non-discrimination, and sovereign equality among States, regardless of geographic or population size, military or economic power; and it is also based on measures and actions related to Respect for the Charter of the United Nations, as well as universal values such as Peace, Development, Equity, Social Justice, Democracy and Freedom, always prioritizing negotiation, harmony, non-interference, mutually beneficial cooperation and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>

<p>7. As a Movement and by being faithful to the Bandung principles, we must continue to propose a global consensus based on Multilateralism, Multipolarity, Cooperation and Solidarity, which allows our countries to successfully implement the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, eradicate poverty, with inequality, reduce hunger, lack of health and education, as well as urgently comply with the commitments established in the Paris Agreement, especially, limiting the increase in global temperature to 1.5°C. and support adaptation, mitigation, Climate Justice actions and a compensation mechanism for Losses and Damage for developing countries.</p>

<p>8. Nicaragua advocates for the strengthening of Multilateralism and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>

<p>9. This important meeting is held in a context of global indignation at the inhuman aggressions, genocide and serious war crimes committed by the Zionist State against the Palestinian population in Gaza and the West Bank, endangering Regional and Global Security and Peace.</p>

<p>10. The Government and People of Nicaragua denounce and strongly condemn the atrocities committed by the Government of Israel against innocent children, defenseless women and the entire Palestinian population in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

<p>11. The People and Government of Nicaragua reaffirms its solidarity with Palestine and joins the friendly Peoples and Governments in supporting an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of genocidal actions and attacks by the Government of Israel against the Palestinian People in the Gaza Strip.<br />
<br />
12. Nicaragua welcomes South Africa's lawsuit against Israel before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) filed on December 29, 2023, for violating its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crime of Genocide of 1948 in relation to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>13. We support with conviction the request of the Sister Palestinian delegation in its legitimate right to recognition as a Full Member of the United Nations, its integration into it and into International Organizations.</p>

<p>14. We also support the celebration of an International Peace Conference on Palestine. It is time for the Peoples of the World to firmly and decisively support the Palestinian People and their Just Cause for the materialization of the Palestinian State, for its Security and for Peace.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>15. Nicaragua takes this opportunity to thank the NAM for the support given to our country in including in the Final Document of this Summit, the case of Nicaragua versus the United States in the International Court of Justice, the highest judicial body of the United Nations, as well as Nicaragua's request to comply with the judicial ruling issued by the International Court of Justice on June 27, 1986, to compensate Nicaragua.</p>

<p>16. The Peoples of the World have the right to exercise our National Sovereignty, Independence, by advancing in the construction and development of our own Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Development Model, free of foreign interference or interventions, threats or aggression.</p>

<p>17. Nicaragua rejects and condemns the illegal, criminal and arbitrary Unilateral Coercive Measures, aggressions and sanctions aimed at suffocating Sovereign Peoples and Governments that do not submit to the powers of imperialism, colonialism and neocolonialism.</p>

<p>18. Our solidarity and revolutionary embrace to the Sister Republic of Cuba that continues to resist acts of terrorism, blockades, economic sanctions, all the aggressions of imperialism and its destabilizing actions.</p>

<p>19. The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of the Republic of Nicaragua, under the Light and Guidance of our President, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and our Vice President, Comrade Rosario Murillo, remains firm and committed to the preservation of peace, stability and security in Nicaragua, making its best efforts and developing its policies to guarantee prosperity for all Nicaraguans, with inclusion and without distinctions.</p>

<p>20. May Justice, Peace, Cooperation, Stability, mutual respect between States, Peoples and Governments, non-interference in internal affairs, respect for International Law, be the path and behavior of our Non-Aligned Movement Countries , in a New International, Multipolar Order, in peaceful coexistence, progress and Inclusive and Sustainable Development.<br />
21. We salute and congratulate the Republic of Uganda, its Government, and its People as the Presidency of this Movement, and we convey our best wishes for success in the leadership during its Presidency.</p>

<p>22. Likewise, we thank the Republic of Azerbaijan for its leadership during these four years, 2019-2023, and for the efforts and initiatives made in leading our Non-Aligned Movement, during its Presidency, particularly during the unprecedented times of the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>23. From now on you have all our support and collaboration to continue advancing in the strengthening, protagonism and revitalization of the NAM, and to make the rights and aspirations of our peoples prevail, without interference or aggression, in a space of sovereign equality, respect mutual, peace, progress and stability.</p>

<p>24. United and in international solidarity, our Progressive and Revolutionary Peoples and Governments will continue to win.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Sisters and Brothers!</p>
