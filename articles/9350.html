after the Memorial Service of the 124th Birth Anniversary of General Augusto C. Sandino<br />
<br />
May 18, 2019</strong></em></h3>

<p>Good afternoon, compañeras, compañeros. Into your homes, into our homes, a fraternal embrace for us all, between all of us, we embrace you with faith and trust in God, striving, as we do every day, for Life, health and strength, striving too so we may continue to work together in Peace and tranquility, following these ways of the common good, of solidarity, of family, seeking to better our lives and the prosperity we all deserve.<br />
<br />
We say today, on the 125th Anniversary of the birth of our General Sandino: Sandino lives and the struggle continues, the struggle that is Life. We have the duty to fight, we have the duty to seek solutions. There are always problems, difficulties, trials, challenges, but we have the duty, in the first place, to call on God, and from the hand of God, to seek solutions to problems, so that we can move forward.<br />
<br />
And these days there are so many questions, so much research, if one reads the written media, if one sees also the national and international media, what does one find? Many questions and few answers. The situation that we have at a global level, what we call a pandemic, is a new situation, unknown, in terms of what the actual disease is that we are facing in the whole world... Unknown and therefore its treatment, treatments also take different approaches.<br />
<br />
Every day we see an opinion in one sense, and another opinion in another sense, or many differing opinions, and the search for vaccines and the search for fairness too, justice in the distribution of vaccines, drugs and the means that all countries, and particularly small countries need in order to address this pandemic in better conditions, in fair conditions, .<br />
<br />
We also learn every day and it is good to have an open mind and heart to learn, the humility above all, to learn, to continue learning, and to accompany us also in our anguish, in our afflictions, in our grief. These are unforeseen, unanticipated situations, no one would have imagined in the middle of last year that we would be facing a world situation like the one we have been facing since March of this year or a little earlier.<br />
<br />
Suffering, much suffering among many families... One of the main causes of suffering is isolation, because we are used to seeing each other, touching each other, enbracing each other, visiting our loved ones, or our friends, to visit also our grandparents, our elderly relatives, and they are activities that we have not been able to do recently. They are a luxury now, and we have been waited for the former times to be restored, to become a little more normal, to share our Love, as we know how to do. We have learned to give Love in other ways, but it is not the same, it is not the same to meet by video conference as it is to greet each other with a great embrace that expresses our Love.<br />
<br />
And well, better times will come, we Believers know that God gives us burdens we can cope with, and we trust in His Mercy, in His Wisdom, and we ask Him to fill us too with serenity, wisdom, patience, prudence, and above all Solidarity which means working for the Common Good, as sisters and brothers, as family.<br />
<br />
I also want to express, today May 18, our Solidarity, speaking of mercy, solidarity, fraternity, with all the Peoples of the world, with our People as well. We all have doubts, afflictions, questions without answers, because, I said, the questions are many, and the answers are more and more dubious still because there is not just one answer, but many, and furthermore we see one information one moment, and then two, three hours later we see another. One day it is said, for example, that there will be a vaccine soon, and another day it is said that the vaccine will take another two years, one year, two years, in short, we are always receiving contradictory information. We are filled with doubts and we are filled with anguish.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as People of faith, People of God, Christian People, in the first place we express our Love and Solidarity in our homes, with our families, in this model and in this strategy that Nicaragua has applied rom the beginning, In response to the need of a small country like ours, which was hit by a Pandemic of hatred in 2018, hit by malevolent hearts in 2018, we need to continue working, continuing to bring food to our families, to the tables of families, through honest labour.<br />
<br />
In this strategy of continuing, insofar as possible, with our daily life, always invoking God, taking all the measures, applying all the recommendations, here we keep going, moving forward. And we feel, of course, in the first place, solidarity among all of us, together with others, given the situation we are going through in the region and in the World, solidarity with others as a Nicaraguan family here too, and assuring each other that all this will pass, and we will emerge from it, I believe, learning and knowing more if we pay enough attention.<br />
<br />
What is God telling us?  What does humanity tell us ? What does this difficult time tell us? What does He teach us ? Because it is our turn to learn, and I hope that we can all learn and grow spiritually and culturally, to be able to promote a life that is more and more fraternal, a life based more on Solidarity and goodwill, among all and for the good of all.<br />
<br />
An embrace to all Nicaraguan families, we know that the struggle continues and we know that the victory is ours, because they are struggles and victories of Peace and Goodness, of good heart, of good hope. We will do better, God willing! We will come out of this strengthened, because we will have learned once more about our own ability, in the Name of Jesus, to face any difficulty, always in the Name of God, with the humility and conscience that we in this plane of life owe to the Lord, and in His Name, and working for the common good, we can overcome.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Dear Friends. This is one more day of struggles and victories, victories of health, of Peace, of goodness. A strong embrace to you all, sharing the challenges and sharing Hope. Thank you, compañeras, compañeros.<br />
