study of declining US influence in Central America</span><br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">By Karla
Jacobs, April 2nd 2009</span><br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Two high level meetings involving Central American leaders took place
last week. On March 25th an extraordinary SICA (Central American
Integration System) Presidential meeting took place in Managua,
Nicaragua. This meeting was organized by Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega who currently holds SICA's rotating presidency. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The main objective of the meeting was to consolidate a united regional
position prior to the Summit of the Americas
which will take place in Trinidad and Tobago in mid-April. Costa Rica,
which has always had a supercilious attitude to the Central
American integration process, chose not to send a representative to the
meeting.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Five days later on March 30th US Vice-President Joe Biden met with the
Presidents of most of the Central American nations in San José,
Costa Rica. This meeting was called by Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias at Biden's request. For Vice-President Biden, San José
was the second and last stop of a trip aimed at getting a feel for
Latin America's leaders' concerns and opinions going into the Americas
summit at which President Barack Obama will encounter the continent's
leaders for the first time. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
If, as he claims, one of Biden's aims was that his trip would mark the
beginning of a new phase of US-Latin American relations based on
mutual respect, he was unable to deliver. In protest at what was
considered the disrespectful decisions not to take into account the
SICA framework for the organization of the second meeting and not to
bother inviting the President of an important associate member&nbsp;of SICA - the
Dominican Republic - neither Ortega nor Honduran President Manuel
Zelaya attended the event, sending government representatives instead. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
The Managua meeting provided clear evidence that the process of Central
American integration is rapidly advancing towards its aim: the
consolidation of an effective regional bloc with a view to countering
intimidation of individual countries by rich nations during bilateral
negotiations or at international forums. What is more, the positions to
come out of the meeting put significant ideological distance between
Central America and the US.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
In the </span><a style="font-family: sans-serif;" href="http://www.sica.int/busqueda/documentos_recientes.aspx">declaration</a><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
signed at the Presidential meeting participants confirmed their "firm
intention" of facilitating regional integration and unity given that it
is considered "the ideal channel through which to overcome our peoples'
problems."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
According to the declaration the aim of agreeing
on a united Central American position going to take to the Americas
summit was achieved. The details of this regional position were
not given but prior to the meeting, President Ortega had confirmed that
one of the most important issues&nbsp;would be an insistence
that Cuba be invited to future Americas' summits and that the US bring
an end to its embargo on the Caribbean nation.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
One of the important issues discussed at the Managua meeting was migration. In
the declaration the Central American leaders were very critical of
current US policy and practice:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Migration
issues should be removed from the US security policy and considered
within the US' development agenda. ...<br>
      <br>
[Policy surrounding migration] should prioritize family unification. ...<br>
      <br>
The practices of mass deportation and persecution [of migrants] within
the US amount to a violation of migrants' human rights.</span><br>
      </div>
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
In anticipation of the meeting with Biden in Costa Rica the SICA
Presidents expressed their thoughts and positions on certain issues:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">i) Diplomatic
exchange and the regional organizations are the legitimate channels
through which bilateral and multilateral agendas between [Central
America and the US] should be discussed and analyzed.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
ii) The principle of mutual respect between democratically elected
governments should be put into practice.<br>
      <br>
iii) All interventionist practices including the use of under cover
operations, parallel diplomacy and media campaigns that go against the
interests of our peoples and our governments must be eliminated. ...<br>
      </div>
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
One of the most surprising things about the meeting was outgoing
Salvadoran President Elias Saca's attitude during the press conference.
Saca, who has acted as a US proxy in the region during his soon to be
completed term, could easily have presented himself as an amiable
dissident but chose instead to express his satisfaction with the
meeting's conclusions and his enthusiasm about SICA's integration
strategy. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
As for the San José, Costa Rica meeting with Biden, analysts and
commentators seem generally to agree that the outcome was significantly
insignificant. Biden did not commit to providing any of the financial
assistance requested as part of the different proposals and requests
presented by the Central American leaders. The only concrete proposal
he brought to the meeting was to increase the funds destined to Central
America as part of the Merida Initiative from US$65 million to US$110
million. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
For many analysts the most important message to come out of the meeting
was that the US is unwilling (or, if Biden's statements are to be taken
at face value, unable) to help the region cope with the effects of the
global financial crisis.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
During both the "Progressive Leaders Summit" in Chile and the meeting
with the Central American leaders in Costa Rica Biden iterated and
reiterated the Obama Administration's desire to "renew" relations with
Latin America, to interact with the region's leaders "as equals." </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
It seems more than evident, however, that many if not the majority of
Latin American leaders expect to see this verbal commitment played out
in terms of the practical consequences of the foreign policy the
US administration applies to the region before defining the conditions of
their engagement with the&nbsp;government of President Barack Obama. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
Unless Obama is able to demonstrate the political will to take a bold
and unconditional move such as bringing an end to the embargo on Cuba,
or implementing a humane migration law in the US, it is hard to imagine
his administration's expressed desire to turn over a new leaf in terms
of its relations with Latin America will come to fruition.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><big style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
