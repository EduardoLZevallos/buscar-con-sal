              15th 2011</span><br>
            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : Would it be fair to say the opposition
            manage a double discourse on the use of the ALBA funds?<br>
            <br>
            Walmaro Gutierrez Mercado : In principle I think it's
            important to emphasise that the Economic Commission is
            practically unanimous in considering&nbsp; that the
            introduction and establishment of Nicaragua as one of the
            members of the Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas -ALBA
            &#8211; has been an important contribution, especially so given
            its growth which is something that has been recognized both
            inside this Commission including by the opposition deputies.<br>
            <br>
            The way in which Nicaragua joined and the way in which it
            has made its economy more dynamic, guaranteeing its economic
            growth is undeniable. So we have to recognize at an
            institutional level that ALBA has been very positive.
            Obviously and unfortunately, mediocre interests prevent
            opposition deputies react in that way for external purposes.<br>
            <br>
            And, sadly, that's where you'll see this double discourse
            whereby although internally they will publicly acknowledge
            that Nicaragua's presence in the ALBA framework has worked
            fundamentally to the benefit of the Nicaraguan economy, for
            external purposes they have attack it with arguments that
            focus negatively. And lamentably that is what some news
            media decide to broadcast. However as teh Economic
            Commission we do indeed believe ALBA has had an highly
            positive, a qualitatively positive impact for Nicaraguans.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : From teh perspective of the Economic Commission what
            in practice has been ALBA's impact? Do you get reports?<br>
            <br>
            Walmaro Gutierrez : As I said to start with, the positive
            impact of Nicaragua's membership of&nbsp; ALBA is
            undeniable. With a reality like that all that's left to the
            opposition is to try and disqualify the source and
            management of the resources because they simply cannot
            disqualify their impact. Because the mere fact that in the
            context of such a strong international economic crisis it's
            possible for more than a million Nicaraguans in Managua to
            use public buses with the same fare of two c&oacute;rdobas
            fifty cents, which is a price frozen since the beginning of
            2007 and that has been guaranteed by ALBA. That is
            undeniable.<br>
            <br>
            The fact, for example, that the price of electricity
            nationally has been subsidised is undeniable. The fact that
            we began 2008 with a trade in basic goods with Venezuela of
            just US$28 million and now in 2011 that trade is reckoned as
            likely to reach US$350 million. When it is impossible to
            disqualify or disparage this kind of attack&nbsp; what they
            do is shift to other lines of attack like trying to smear or
            make the population believe the funds are not managed
            transparently.. The truth is that if these funds were no
            managed transparently they simply would not have had the
            impact they have in fact had, especially for the most
            impoverished Nicaraguans.<br>
            <br>
            Now in relation to information, on repeated occasions the
            various institutions involved in the Bolivarian Alternative
            of the Americas have reported and sent information to the
            Economic Commission concerning the origin, use,
            beneficiaries and impact of the ALBA resources. But it
            should be noted that not only do they supply information to
            the Economic Commission. That information is also freely
            available to those responsible for regulating the national
            economy such as the Central Bank and you will know very well
            that the Central Bank publishes all its information on its
            web site. Likewise the Superintendent of Banks is informed.
            The Finance Ministry also has the relevant information.
            PRONICARAGUA has the relevant information.<br>
            <br>
            In other words, the only ones who cannot see are the ones
            who out their hands over their eyes. The truth is that the
            information is there. It is available at any time. It is
            highly accessible. But most importantly it is serving to
            reduce the poverty spread around over 16 years by neoliberal
            governments and that is why today Nicaraguans recognize the
            positive results of President Ortega's administration and
            obviously too the support and huge help ALBA has been in
            terms of economic growth and poverty reduction in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            When the President of the Republic took the correct decision
            for Nicaragua to join ALBA that led to a series of
            international treaties on economic issues aimed at
            consolidating and formalizing&nbsp; economic relations with
            the State of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. As a
            result of the signing of those treaties, in accordance with
            the Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua, those
            treaties came here to the National Assembly to be ratified.<br>
            <br>
            So then each and every one of the substantive elements of
            economic and trade relations between Nicaragua and Venezuela
            within the ALBA framework are fully documented and well know
            to all the deputies in this national parliament. The
            different instruments, for example, the treaties to do with
            financial strengthening, the treaty on trade and the treaty
            on help to change the country's energy matrix, the one to do
            with basic foods and with strengthening the agricultural
            sector among other treaties of a commercial nature and of
            trade relations, all these were known by the Foreign Affairs
            Commission which is not even managed by the Frente
            Sandinista but rather is controlled by the country's
            opposition.<br>
            <br>
            They controlled it then and they continue to control it. As
            for the Economic Commission this is no controlled by the
            Frente Sandinista, but when these relations were formalized
            it was not. At that time, it too was controlled by the
            opposition. So all these substantive elements of Nicaragua's
            bilateral relations with Venezuela are fully known to the
            opposition deputies and they know very well too the positive
            impact this trade relationship has had and the positive
            impact it has had on our export growth.<br>
            <br>
            So then to say there is no information or there are no
            mechanisms for information flows is a vile untruth because
            at the moment they request that information from the Central
            Bank, from PRONICARAGUA, from any of the institutions
            involved in the country's economic management they have
            perfectly ready access to that information. Furthermore, the
            President of the Central Bank himself, prior to the
            ratification of those treaties here in Nicaragua, came to
            explain to the deputies of all the different parliamentary
            groupings in the different parliamentary commissions the
            objective, the extent the content and the impact of that
            bilateral relation within the ALBA framework.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : What's your vision of ALBA's development over the next
            few years?<br>
            <br>
            Walmaro Gutierrez : I think Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cuba,
            Ecuador, Bolivia are countries that are trying to show by
            example to the rest of the sister countries of Latin America
            that there does exist an alternative of developing fair
            trade. Remember throughout our history have endured trade
            relationships developed under extremely unequal conditions,
            the kind of relations in which whoever has money calls the
            shots and the ones who don't have to keep quiet. <br>
            <br>
            With the Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas, the
            proposal for fair trade is a reality&nbsp; and it is being
            shown that trade as such is being turned into a tool to
            combat poverty not as it has been traditionally seen, namely
            as a tool of enrichment for countries with great resources
            and one of systematic impoverishment for countries that were
            economically vulnerable.<br>
            So we think that in the short, medium and long term we are
            going to have the capacity and the chance to be able to
            continue integrating more Latin American countries into this
            alternative. Remember that Bolivar's dream is that of the
            great Latin American nation and to have the opportunity a
            group of being able together to review and renegotiate the
            rules of the game with which unfortunately up until now have
            been imposed on us via unfair free trade treaties which in
            one form or another have been imposed the length and breadth
            of Latin America.<br>
            <br>
            I think that in fact ALBA means a new beginning, a new
            opportunity for Latin American nations to be able to use
            their resources for trade exchange that allows them to
            escape from poverty and ensure a more just redistribution of
            wealth not just at a national or regional level but at the
            level of all of Latin America. That is why we recognize
            clearly and categorically the positive impact of ALBA in
            countries like Nicaragua and we hope that in the same way
            that Nicaragua has benefited from this solidarity framework,
            let's hope that many Central American and Latin American
            countries may be able to benefit themselves, just as
            Nicaragua has.<br>
            <br>
            This isn't a case of I get what I need and everyone else can
            go to hell, get carried away on the tide. No. Quite the
            reverse. One hand washes the other. Only the people will
            save the people. And so we think this alternative is going
            to give us the chance to bring the countries of Latin
            America together because I think that is the only way to
            fight poverty, systematically and in an integrated way, the
            poverty we inherited from earlier unjust trade treaties.<br>
