Most of what has happened in Honduras since the shock of the&nbsp; coup
d'etat on June 28th has confounded traditional regional clich&eacute;s
and stereotypes about the country. On the other hand, events have
reinforced longstanding and widely held opinions in Latin America about
the cynicism of the United States government and its allies and also
about the utter mediocrity of the region's right wing oligarchies. It
has also clarified beyond any doubt the blatant propaganda role of
Western Bloc corporate media's use of foreign news coverage as a
conscious and key component of their governments' imperialist
strategies.<br>
      <br>
The day after the coup it was possible to write &#8220;Obama will talk about
the need for dialogue and negotiation &#8211; anything to delay and waste
time until his administration can recognize a newly elected government.
The most likely outcome will be a government all too ready to ratify
the illegal acts of the current usurper pinochetti regime. The closest
US allies, world champion hypocrites, the Europeans, will probably do
the same.&#8221; (1) Now, after four months of acting in practice to win time
for their coup-regime allies, the US government has finally intervened
in order to get the result it needs to validate the elections scheduled
for November 29th this year. <br>
      <br>
On October 30th Thomas Shannon, Barack Obama's point man for Latin
America and the Caribbean, as he was for George W. Bush too, persuaded
the Honduran coup regime leaders to strike a deal that might permit
deposed president Manuel&nbsp; Zelaya to see out his presidential term
as a figurehead president without real power, until January 27th 2010.
Throughout, President Obama pointedly avoided meeting President Manuel
Zelaya even once, despite Zelaya's frequent visits to Washington in the
course of his attempts to mobilize and sustain diplomatic support for
his reinstatement. The episode could not indicate more clearly US
government hypocrisy and cynicism at the very highest level about
support for democracy.<br>
      <br>
At a diplomatic level, it has been the practical, political support of
the ALBA countries led by President Chavez of Venezuela and President
Ortega of Nicaragua and, of late, Brazilian President Ignacio Lula da
Silva, that has enabled Manuel Zelaya to sustain his challenge to the
mediocre fascists running the coup regime in Tegucigalpa. It was
Zelaya's own courage and obstinacy that made possible his return to
Tegucigalpa so as to force the coup regime's hand. His presence in the
Brazilian embassy and the grotesque abuse inflicted on him and his
supporters there by the coup regime, embarrassed the regime's
supporters around the world, but especially Hillary Clinton and her
colleagues in the US State Department.<br>
      <br>
Now, under the wording Thomas Shannon seems to have imposed, the coup
regime may or may not implement the spirit of the agreement signed on
Friday October 30th. Clause Five of that Tegucigalpa/San Jos&eacute;
Agreement&nbsp; reads: <br>
      <br>
&#8220;To obtain reconciliation and strengthen democracy, in the spirit of
the issues of the proposal of the San Jos&eacute; Agreement, both
negotiating commissions have decided, respectfully, that the national
Congress, as an institutional expression of popular sovereignty, in the
use of its faculties, in consultation with the instances it may
consider pertinent, like the Supreme Court of Justice, and in
accordance with the law, resolves on what is fitting with regard to
'retro-enact the position of the Executive Power to its state prior to
June 28th until the conclusion of the current period of government on
January 27th 2010.'<br>
      <br>
The decision that the National Congress adopts should lay the basis for
reaching the social peace, political tranquility and democratic
governance that society demands and the country needs.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
One wonders what collective fever took hold of the people who
celebrated this evasive farrago as some kind of breakthrough for
President Zelaya. The text could very easily be abused via a literal
interpretation in line with the coup regime's rejection and hatred of
President Manuel Zelaya. Still, as one might have expected (since it
solves their difficulty about being able to recognize the upcoming
elections), the US government representatives hailed the agreement as
the end of the matter &#8211; despite that disingenuous, formalistic nonsense
in Clause Five. <br>
      <br>
Ambassador Hugo Llorens announced that normal consular services will
resume on November 2nd. Pro-coup regime governments around the world
heaved a collective sigh of relief. They too now can openly &#8211; rather
than covertly as they have done until now - channel resources and
support to the reactionary elements that executed and sustained the
coup. Other governments, with long experience of the deceitful cynicism
of the United States authorities and their regional allies have been
more circumspect. <br>
      <br>
For example, Venezuela's ambassador to the Organization of American
States remarked, &#8220;My delegation is not in any mood to join in an orgy
of congratulations. One should let time mature the latest news so as to
be sure of this precedent, and that democratic processes are not
impeded by means of constitutional tricks managed either astutely or
stupidly...&#8221; Nicaragua's OAS representative Denis Moncada said, &#8220;one
cannot approve any document... so long as it lacks confirmation by
Zelaya that he is in agreement with what the Congress agrees.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
As of November 1st, all the signs indicate that the coup regime will
drag out implementation of the Tegucigalpa/San Jos&eacute; Agreement so
as to delay even more any eventual restitution of President Manuel
Zelaya until after the elections scheduled for November 29th. The only
pressure on the coup regime is that the United States government and
its allies need to be able to validate the elections in order to be
able to recognize the new government that may result from them. The
crucial point of the Tegucigalpa/San Jose Agreement is that President
Zelaya's team has agreed that his reinstatement depends on a decision
of the National Congress. The coup-monger Congress deputies may agree
to reinstatement or they may not.<br>
      <br>
That crucial point means that the United States government and its
allies will probably be able to recognize the elections of November
29th even if the National Congress refuses to reinstate President
Zelaya. Should that turn out to be the case, two things are likely to
happen. Firstly, the Organization of American States will divide. The
split may well threaten the very existence of the organization.<br>
      <br>
On one side of the division will be countries allied with the United
States (principally, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico Panama
and&nbsp; Peru). On the other side will be countries opposed to the
United States (the ALBA bloc of Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador and
Bolivia - supported by Cuba which is not a member of the OAS). A group
of countries including Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador, Chile,
Guatemala, Paraguay and Uruguay will probably tend to side with the
ALBA countries but will be loth to deliver the coup de grace that will
signal the demise of the OAS . <br>
      <br>
The second thing that will happen, if the National Congress refuses to
reinstate President Zelaya promptly prior to the elections scheduled
for November 29th, is that the popular resistance to the coup regime
will radicalize and intensify. That in its turn will provoke increased
repression from the coup regime security forces. The consequences of
such a spiral of radicalization and repression are unforeseeable and
may well render the elections even more of a farcical failure than they
were likely to be anyhow.<br>
      <br>
The unprecedented&nbsp; endurance of the popular resistance movement,
faced with murderous, brutal repression, combined powerfully with
President Manuel Zelaya's stubborn refusal to abandon his campaign for
reinstatement. Continuous mass mobilizations took place not just in
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, the country's main cities, but in
smaller cities and towns across the nation. Trades unions, especially
the teachers unions, rural workers organizations, women's
organizations, students and professional organizations, like those of
lawyers and artists, astounded the coup regime and its supporters with
the resilience and determination of mass non-violent resistance in
defiance of the regime's utterly ruthless, vicious repression.<br>
      <br>
Now, by jerry-rigging a non-solution to the four month long crisis via
the Tegucigalpa/San Jos&eacute; Agreement, the United States government
has ignored the fundamental demands of the Honduran Resistance. Those
demands were a meaningful restoration of President Zelaya to power and
a Constituent Assembly. An intimately related issue is that of
impunity. The US brokered agreement leaves the crimes of the coup
regime untouched. So what, in fact, the US government seems to have
done is impose a fake resolution to the crisis, overwhelmingly
favourable to its allies in the coup regime, that simply postpones the
conflict to another phase.<br>
      <br>
All those commentators who suggested that an Obama Presidency might
usher in an era harking back to the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
&#8220;Good Neighbour&#8221; diplomacy in Latin America were right. Just as in
Roosevelt's time, the US government has used hypocritical half-measures
and emitted double-talking declarations in support of democracy. By
default, it has tacitly approved and effectively enabled a vicious,
brutal dictatorship in Central America. The US government had the
chance to act in solidarity and sympathy with the gentle giant of the
democratic, non-violent, majority, Honduran popular resistance and
chose, under the non-leadership of President Can't-press-a-button
Obama, not to do so .<br>
      <br>
It is 80 years since the Roosevelt administration's support for the
murderous Honduran dictator Tiburcio Carias Andino. Now the the Obama
administration hopes to validate the Pinochetti coup regime's overthrow
of President Manuel Zelaya, locking in place measures taken under the
criminal coup regime, by means of a hopelessly discredited election
supervised by the same corrupt fraudulent authorities who participated
in the coup. Likewise, those already discredited elections are to be
secured by the same murderous, brutal security forces responsible for
killing dozens, and seriously injuring hundreds, of non-violent
resistance supporters. <br>
      <br>
It will all be &#8220;observed&#8221; by bodies like the OAS and the European
Union, pre-disposed to impose a flawed, unfair result. The precedent
has already been set in Haiti. Perhaps that is why there has been talk
that the executioner of democracy in Haiti, Colin Powell, may have been
drafted in to oversee the &#8220;verification&#8221; phase of the agreement in
Honduras.&nbsp; Despite the long drawn out, false manipulation of
events by the Good Neighbour and its regional proxies, it seems
unlikely, after all the sacrifices and suffering, that the gentle giant
the coup woke up on June 28th this year will just go tamely back to
sleep.<br>
