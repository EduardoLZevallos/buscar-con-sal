On June 16th, 39 former public officials and other individuals accused
of collaborating in and facilitating the fraudulent financial operation
known as the CENIs scandal received formal notification of the
indictment against them. On June 22nd the preliminary hearing took
place, although Judge Julio César Arias suspended the trial until two
of the accused, Noel Ramírez and Eduardo Montealegre (who are protected
from legal prosecution thanks to the parliamentary immunity they enjoy
as deputies in the Central American and National Assemblies,
respectively) are stripped of their immunity and obliged to present
themselves in court. <br>
<br>
The CENIs scandal is widely referred to as the biggest fraud in
Nicaraguan history. CENIs are government bonds - literally Negotiable
Investment Certificates - issued by the Central Bank in a somewhat
similar way to US Treasury bonds. The CENIs scandal resulted from a
three stage financial operation
implemented during the administrations of former presidents Arnoldo
Aleman (1996 - 2001) and Enrique Bolaños (2001 - 2006), the Nicaraguan
state was effectively bankrupted to the personal and commercial benefit
of
a number of Nicaraguan oligarchs.<br>
<br>
The operation began in 2000 when the Directors of Interbank (a private
Nicaraguan bank) declared the institution insolvent. As part of an
agreement between the government of the time and BANPRO, another
private Nicaraguan bank, BANPRO absorbed Interbank under extremely
favourable conditions: The Nicaraguan Central Bank would issue a number
of Negotiable Investment Certificates or CENIs (high interest rate
bonds) in favour of BANPRO to compensate BANPRO for the losses it might incur. But BANPRO - thanks to
dishonest evaluations by unscrupulous government financial advisors - was able to acquire Interbank's
loan portfolio for less than 30% of its real value and then go on to
make multimillion dollar profits charging full value to former Interbank clients
according to the original interest and payback arrangements.<br>
<br>
The damage to Nicaragua's finances would not have been so catastrophic
if the operation ended there. But during the next few months, in the
second stage of the scandal, four
more private banks - Bamer, Banic, Banco del Sur and Bancafé -were
declared insolvent. To cope with the effects of thsoe insolvencies, the
government proposed a similar deal to the original deal with Banpro.
Terms
were agreed between the government and two other private banks,
Bancentro and BDF, whose directors fell over themselves to grab
the concessionary conditions on offer. <br>
<br>
According to the government of the time, the CENIs bonds were issued in
the name of guaranteeing public deposits and macroeconomic stability.
As economist Adolfo Acevedo says, however, "the issuing of the CENIs
actually provoked a much greater risk of a severe financial and
monetary crisis."<br>
<br>
As part of the initial agreements CENIs bonds earned up to 21% annual
interest. Consequentially the Central Bank incurred short term loan
obligations
equivalent to 95% of the country's brute international reserves. It was
impossible, therefore, for the Central Bank to pay the debts
without a dramatic drop in the country's international reserves which
threatened to provoke a disastrous&nbsp;national financial and
monetary crisis.<br>
<br>
In order to avoid this scenario, the Nicaraguan government embarked on
a programme of severe budgetary cut backs, adversely affecting crucial
sectors of public spending. Even funds freed
up as the result of the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative)
were used to service Nicaragua's internal debt despite the explicit
requirement that these funds be used for poverty reduction programs.<br>
<br>
In 2002 the amount the government&nbsp; set-aside to
service&nbsp;internal debt grew by approximately US$100 million
compared to 2001.
The amount grew by a further US$100 million in 2003 compared to 2002.
By 2004, as a result of accumulating interest, the amount grew by a
further US$200 million compared to 2003. These are shocking figures
considering that Nicaragua's average annual budget between 2002 and
2004 was just over US$929 million.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the debacle of the state's finances provoked by the fraudulent
operation surrounding the CENIs is probably one of the main reasons,
along with lack of political will, that the Bolaños government was
unable to deliver on even its most basic social obligations in terms of
things like
healthcare, education and infrastructure development. All this time
the governments of the United States and the European Union were
praising the Enrique Bolaños government for its responsible fiscal
management and its stance on anti-corruption, for its commitment to the "free market".<br>
<br>
In 2003 the third stage of the financial operation was set into motion
during the period in which Eduardo Montealegre served&nbsp;under President Bolaños as Finance
Minister. This stage, referred to as the "re-engineering" of the CENIs
debt, involved a slight reduction in the interest rates the State paid
on the CENIs bonds issued to BANPRO, Bancentro and BDF and the
auctioning off of properties and goods inherited by the State from the
banks declared insolvent in 1999 - 2000. While the government put a brave face on the supposed benefits of the
renegotiation of the CENIs debt, in fact the beneficiaries of this
stage of the operation were the private banks and in particular
Bancentro. <br><br>At
the time Montealegre was a major shareholder in the bank
and a member of its Board of Directors. A major concern related to the
auctioning off of properties and other goods. The sell-off incurred
major losses for the State's patrimony. The results of the auction were
widely&nbsp;perceived to have been&nbsp;
rigged. The values of auctioned properties were were effectively those
of a fire-sale, reduced to approximately 10% of their real
value, according to the Public Prosecutor's Office investigation.<br>
<br>
According to the&nbsp;Comptroller-General's Office, which had carried out a
previous investigation into the CENIs scandal in 2005, this second
phase of the financial operation provoked losses to the Nicaraguan
State of over $100 million, on top of the losses of US$492 million
resulting from the initial phase.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Since the FSLN came to power in 2007 there has been pressure from a
number of sectors, including sectors within the FSLN, not to continue
servicing the CENIs debt which, as established by the Comptroller General's
Office, is an illegal debt. Current President of the Central Bank,
Antenor Rosales, has refused to consider this option, however, arguing
that the practical consequences of simply refusing to service the debt
(plummeting confidence in the security of Central Bank bonds) would be
more damaging than continuing to make payments.<br><br>Rosales
and his colleagues argue that Nicaragua could not manage the
consequences should existing and potential holders of Negotiable
Investment Certificates lose confidence in the Nicaraguan government's
commitment to honouring the terms of those bonds in the open market.
The government uses bonds like the CENIs to manage the country's money
supply and to help fund its budget deficit. Furthermore, it is not at
all clear whether some significant proportion of the original CENIs
that were the cause of the scandal have not been sold on to foreign
investors outside Nicaragua, with all the complications that might imply.<br>
<br>
What Antenor Rosales and his colleagues have been able to achieve, in 2008, is a second renegotiation of
the debt. This renegotiation saw interest rates reduced to 8% or lower
and increased the payback period from 8 to 20 years thus freeing up a
significant amount of government funds for public spending, funds that
would otherwise have been used to service the debt. Argument continues
as to the legitimacy of the latest renegotiation and that of the&nbsp;
renegotiation in&nbsp;2003.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Now that it looks as though the trial against those implicated in the
CENIs scandal is finally about to begin, expectations about political and other fallout that could result dominate political
commentary in&nbsp;Nicaragua. It would appear to be only a matter of
time until the National Assembly
deputies vote on whether to strip Eduardo Montealegre of his immunity.
Meanwhile there are signs that suggest the US Embassy has finally
realized that Montealegre - widely regarded as&nbsp;their golden boy -
is actually a dud and plan to create a
united right wing force around the figure of Arnoldo Aleman.<br>
<br>
At the end of May, Arnoldo Aleman presided over a meeting between
leaders of the PLC
and right-wing figures closely associated with the US Embassy such as
Antonio Lacayo, Violeta Chamorro's son in law and former first
minister, and César Zamora, head of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Nicaragua. According to Francisco Aguirre, a PLC
deputy, the fundamental conclusion reached during the meeting was that
only a united&nbsp;right wing would have a chance of winning the 2011
elections. A&nbsp;majority vote to
strip Montealegre of his immunity may or may not happen. That
definitely does now depend on the PLC deputies controlled by Arnoldo
Alemán.<br>
<br>The list of the accused in the CENIs case includes two
former presidents of the Central Bank, two former finance ministers,
and two former presidents of the Bank Superintendent's office, among
over
twenty other former public officials. It is hard to imagine these 39
white collar bankers and bureaucrats&nbsp;actually ending up sharing
cells
in Tipitapa's El Modelo prison, just outside Managua, with
chicken-thieves, drug-pushers and gang-members. The most interesting
thing about this stage of the saga will be to see
how far the Ortega government is able to go in bringing justice to the
men and women responsible for causing&nbsp;almost
inconceivable&nbsp;damage to the Nicaraguan people and their right to a
functional,
viable State.<br>
<br>
Looking back over the details of the fraudulent operation known as the
CENIs scandal, it is impossible not to pick up on the parallels with
the US government's&nbsp; bailout plan which both the Bush and Obama
governments have used to manage giant insolvencies on Wall Street.
Fundamentally, what both financial operations boil
down to is the accumulation of unsustainable amounts of public debt in
order to benefit society's richest members while provoking severe
hardship for society's most vulnerable. Another way in which the two
operations are similar is that they were both hailed as a solution to a
financial crisis. In actual fact both cases demonstrate governments
acting undemocratically to preserve the wealth of their countries'
respective oligarchies, while provoking dramatic cutbacks and
unemployment for the majority. <br>
