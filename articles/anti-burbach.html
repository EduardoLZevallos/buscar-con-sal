                of Nicaraguan politics and economics over the last few
                years</a>
              Roger
              Burbach seems to rely completely on interpretations
              borrowed from
              Nicaraguan opposition social democrat politicians and
              their right
              wing allies. That explains why Burbach's account, where it
              is not
              factually inaccurate, is so wrong and fuzzy. The sources
              he has used
              all operate at one remove from the North American and
              European
              embassies of the imperialist countries that give them
              financial and
              political support.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">A
              few examples :</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:
"But
the
              Ortega government's clientelistic and sectarian nature
              soon
              became evident when Ortega, by presidential decree,
              established
              Councils of Citizen Power under the control of the
              Sandinista party
              to administer and distribute much of the social spending.”
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">This
              is simply a downright falsehood. It&nbsp;is
              the&nbsp;anti-democratic right-wing opposition exploiting
              its overall majority on the National Assembly that
              is&nbsp;"clientelistic and sectarian". Anyone who works at
              community level
              –&nbsp;barrios in urban centres or comarcas in rural areas
              – knows
              that
              the
              Consejos de Poder Ciudadano have a communications role
              telling
              government what communities think and need and
              coordinating
              government responses in their barrio or comarcas.&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Here
              Burbach is not
              just wrong but downright dishonest. He has very clearly
              never had any
              practical interaction with the CPCs. The
              CPCs are a logical development of the municipal community
              councils
              that liaise and coordinate with local government. These
              have&nbsp;existed for many years and operated under
              the previous neo-liberal Nicaraguan governments.&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Right-wing
politicians
              and their social democrat allies are aghast at the CPCs
              because, if they can be made to work as envisaged, they
              mark a
              revolutionary shift in political power and decision-making
              from the
              elites to people at grass roots. Daniel Ortega only
              resorted to
              presidential decree when the right-wing opposition blocked
              the relevant
              legislation, trying to deny ordinary people in Nicaragua
              their
              constitutional right to organize and lobby central
              government
              effectively.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:
“...under
the
              rubric of ALBA, Ortega signed an accord with Venezuela
              that
              provides an estimated $300 million to $500 million in
              funds
              personally administered by Ortega with no public
              accountability."</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
              is hard to know what Burbach is referring to here. But,
              whether out
              of ignorance or ill-intent, his statement is completely
              inaccurate.
              Last year Daniel Ortega publicly announced the ALBA funds
              have
              contributed well over US$500 million to a wide range of
              projects On
              January 11<sup>th</sup>
              2007, the day after his inauguration, Daniel Ortega signed
              an
              agreement, together with Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales and
              Cuban
              Vice-President Juan Ramón Machado, making Nicaragua a full
              member of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas .</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">At
              the same time, Francisco Lopez, the new head of
              Nicaragua's State oil
              company, Petronic, strengthened an already existing
              arrangement with
              Venezuela under the Petrocaribe agreement. Petronic signed
              a
              commercial agreement (convenio) with Venezuela's State oil
              company
              PDVSA. The agreement's main points were that Petronic
              would import
              oil and oil derivatives from Venezuela and pay 50% of the
              amount due
              within 30 days.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The
              remaining 50% would be repaid over 20 years at 2%
              interest. Over that
              period 25% of the total amount due was to be managed by
              PDVSA through
              an ALBA social fund. The remaining 25% was to be
              administered by a
              Nicaraguan institution. In practice, both parts of the
              outstanding
              50% are administered on the basis of a commercial
              financial agreement
              between PDVSA and the Caja Rural Nacional (CARUNA) – a
              savings and
              loan cooperative, founded in the mid 1990s that
              administers funds for
              numerous foreign organizations working in Nicaragua.
              Subsquently,
              PDVSA and Petronic set up a joint company called ALBANISA
              in which
              PDVSA is the majority shareholder but operating on the
              same basis as
              that of the first convenio between Petronic and
              PDVSA.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Petronic
is
              subject to all the controls that apply to State companies
              in
              Nicaragua. It reports regularly to the Economic Affairs
              Committee of
              Nicaragua's National Assembly. It is obliged to file
              annual accounts
              with the tax office of the Finance Ministry and to keep
              its records
              up to date in the Registro Mercantil. It is also subject
              to audit by
              the independent State audit body, the Contraloría General.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">CARUNA
as
              a savings and loan cooperative is subject to the relevant
              legislation that applies to financial institutions in
              Nicaragua as
              well as to the law applying to cooperatives. As a
              financial
              institution it is supervised by the Superintendencia de
              Bancos y
              Otras Organizaciones Financieras and has to file tax
              returns and
              other relevant reports to the Ministry of Finance. As a
              cooperative
              it is subject to supervision by the Instituto de Fomento a
              las
              Cooperativas. As a cooperative Caruna also has to report
              regularly to
              its members and its board has to submit to periodic
              elections.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">So
              it is completely untrue that Daniel Ortega personally
              administers
              hundreds of millions of dollars with no accountability. He
              has to
              work within the restrictions of Nicaragua's relevant
              national
              legislation and also within the terms of the agreements
              both with
              PDVSA and the other ALBA governments which have their own
              reporting
              and audit processes to control the use of ALBA funds.</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:
              “As Monica Baltodano, the leader of Rescate, a dissident
              Sandinista
              organization, argued in a recent article, Ortega's fiscal
              and
              economic policies are, in fact, continuous with those of
              the previous
              governments, despite his anti-imperialist rhetoric and
              denunciations
              of neoliberalism.”</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">This
              is also completely counterfactual. As context, Burbach
              should have
              mentioned that Monica Baltodano – a consummate political
              opportunist if ever there was one – has hypocritically and
              consistently voted with the extreme right wing opposition
              parties
              since her election as a deputy for the MRS alliance in
              2006. Her
              recent cynical, deceitful article in Le Monde Diplomatique
              is all of
              a piece with the current trahison des clercs of
              individuals like Noam
              Chomsky, Ignacio Ramonet, Jose Saramago, Tom Hayden,
              Eduardo Galeano
              and others – who have indeed betrayed the interests of
              Nicaragua's impoverished majority by siding with an
              elitist
              centre-right/social democrat clique miffed at their
              persistent,
              humiliating electoral defeats.</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach
              might have noted that in June 2007 FSLN deputies
              managed to push the new Minimum Wage Law (Law 625) through
              the
              National Assembly without permitting substantial
              modification by the
              opposition. This was a much needed piece of legislation
              the
              "fundamental objective of which is to <a
href="http://legislacion.asamblea.gob.ni/Normaweb.nsf/%28$All%29/D4A4AB6A3935BB7906257331005B6D2C?OpenDocument">put
into
                practice Article 82 of the
                Nicaraguan constitution which states that "workers have
                the
                right to a salary which permits a state of wellbeing
                compatible with
                human dignity."</a> The law created the National Minimum
              Wage
              Commission which is made up of representatives of workers
              unions, the
              private sector and the Ministry of Labor (MITRAB). This
              commission is
              required to meet every six months to discuss appropriate
              adjustments
              to the minimum wage. The
              minimium wage increased 18% in 2007, 15% in January 2008
              and another
              18% in October 2008. Inflation in 2008 was just under
              14%.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Currently
              the government is in dispute with the country's employers'
              organization because the FSLN wants to review the minimum
              wage twice
              a year, as required by the current law and the employers,
              self-evidently, do not. Burbach might equally have noted
              that the
              calculation of the canasta básica – a fundamental economic
              benchmark for wage negotiations and social welfare
              calculations, was
              dramatically increased in August 2007 from around US$160
              to around
              US$360.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach
              takes Baltodano's deceitful use of the statistical
              comparison of
              average real salaries between 2001 and 2008 as a
              benchmark. What
              Baltodano and, with culpable negligence, Burbach leave out
              are the
              factors affecting that average. Neither Baltodano nor
              Burbach note
              that the first thing Daniel Ortega did on taking office
              was cut his
              and his government officials salaries by 50% or more,
              saving the
              country millions of dollars a year. At the same time
              public sector
              employment increased from under 40,000 employees at the
              end of the
              previous government in 2006 to 78,000 at the end of 2007
              and to
              83,000 at the end of 2008. Even on that basis Baltodano's
              and
              Burbach's bald figure looks very different. Clearly the
              average will
              be affected by a massive decrease in public sector
              salaries at the
              top and a 100% increase in people employed.</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
              apart from that, if one looks at the statistics in detail,
              Baltodano's statistic cited by Burbach does not take into
              account that
              in
              December 2007, before the dramatic inflationary spike that
              affected
              the whole world, the figure looked more like the figure
              for 2005.
              It's worth looking at the complete figures to get a
              feeling for
              Baltodano's deceit and Burbach's lazy citation of it:</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Real
              average public sector salary for 2001 was C$1264, for 2005
              C$1599, for
              2007 C$1563, for 2008 C$1352. Real national salary for
              2001 was
              C$1422, for 2005 C$1612, for 2007 C$1549, for 2008 C$1390</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
              real average salaries were well above 2001 levels at the
              end of 2007
              despite the inflationary spike of that year's second
              semester. The
              decline in 2008 can be attributed mainly to the massive
              inflationary
              pressures of that year's first semester. In addition, one
              should also
              note that over 60% of people in Nicaragua work in the
              informal sector
              for which no reliable figures exist.</p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Beyond
              those considerations, that show categorically how
              misleading
              Baltodano's and Burbach's statistic is, a fair comparison
              would be
              one showing the situation in other countries in Central
              America.
              Something which nether Baltodano nor Burbach can be
              bothered with,
              because their main concern is self-evidently not to get at
              the facts
              or something resembling the truth. Their concerns are
              overwhelmingly
              propaganda concerns to make the Nicaraguan government look
              bad.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:”National
              Assembly deputy Alejandro Bolaños, who backed the
              denunciation, was arbitrarily removed from his legislative
              seat.”</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Alejandro

              lost the right to sit as a deputy in Nicaragua's

              received a
              complaint that Bolaños, because he had US citizenship just
              prior to the 2006 elections, was disqualified from being a
              candidate.
              That complaint was taken up and found to be accurate.
              After due
              process involving the Supreme Electoral Council, the
              National
              Assembly and the Supreme Court, Bolaños lost his
              seat.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">It
              is completely untrue that he was “arbitrarily removed”.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:
“the
              Ortega-stacked Supreme Electoral Council disqualified the
              MRS
              and the Conservative Party from participation. “</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Early
in
              2008 Wilfredo Navarro, a leader of the right wing PLC
              party
              presented a complaint to the Supreme Electoral Council
              alleging that
              the MRS and Conservative parties were not entitled to
              participate in
              the upcoming municipal elections of November that year.
              The Supreme
              Electoral Council is made up of three magistrates proposed
              by the
              PLC, three magistrates proposed by the FSLN and its
              President Roberto
              Rivas Reyes, who is independent of either of those
              political parties.
              It is completely untrue to state that the CSE is stacked
              in favour of
              the FSLN and Daniel Ortega. This is exactly the same CSE
              that oversaw
              the elections&nbsp;won by the PLC's Enrique Bolaños in
              2001, and
              all
              subsequent elections in Nicaragua since then.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The
              CSE repeatedly asked the MRS to confirm its departmental
              and
              municipal representatives, extending the deadline to
              receive that
              information by over a year. When the MRS failed to do so,
              the CSE was
              obliged to apply the law as it stood. That decision
              actually damaged
              the chances of the FSLN candidate in Managua, where
              support for the
              MRS is mainly based, because if the MRS had been able to
              run they
              would have divided the opposition vote. That is why the
              PLC tried to
              eliminate them.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">But
              the PLC's tactics backfired when the MRS leadership,
              including Dora
              Maria Tellez openly called on their supporters to vote for
              Eduardo
              Montealegre, the extreme right-wing candidate in Managua.
              What
              happened then was that large groups of MRS activists
              publicly
              repudiated their party and announced they would return to
              support the
              FSLN. Burbach's account excludes all this information
              without which
              it is impossible to understand what happened in the recent
              Nicaraguan
              municipal elections.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:”In
August,
              after Cardenal criticized Ortega at Lugo’s inauguration, a
              judge revived an old, previously dismissed case involving
              a German
              citizen who sued Cardenal in 2005 for insulting him.”</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The
              property dispute between Ernesto Cardenal and Immanuel
              Zerger and his
              wife Nubia Arcia has been running since 1998, involving
              various
              judgements the latest of which in 2005 was subject to an
              appeal from
              Zerger. In the latest judgement in 2008, Cardenal was
              found to have
              slandered Zerger. By Zerger and Arcia's account,
              Cardenal's own
              behaviour over many years during the prolonged property
              dispute with
              Zerger and Arcia has been quite contrary to what one might
              expect
              from the image cultivated by Cardenal and his supporters.
              Burbach, in
              line with his propaganda mission for the Nicaraguan
              opposition,
              chooses not to mention that. Nor does he mention as
              relevant context
              that Ernesto Cardenal recently held a friendly meeting for
              his
              propaganda purposes with the Inter-American Press Society
              – the
              fascist bosses' organization of Latin America's right wing
              Press
              media.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:
“independent
              surveys indicated that the opposition candidates would
              win the majority of the seats”</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Of
              the surveys published in the run up to the municipal
              elections most
              opinion polls predicted gains for the FSLN. In particular,
              they
              predicted victory in Managua for the FSLN candidate Alexis
              Argüello
              by a margin of victory similar to that which he in fact
              obtained.
              CID-Gallup's polling was typical in that respect, with
              about 30% of
              those polled undecided. It is completely false of Burbach
              to suggest
              the opinion polls predicted an opposition win.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:
“An
              independent Nicaraguan group, Ethics and Transparency,
              organized tens of thousands of observers but was denied
              accreditation, forcing them to observe the election from
              outside
              polling stations. But the group estimates that
              irregularities took
              place at a third of the polling places.”</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">“Etica
y
              Transparencia” is an NGO heavily dependent on funding from
              USAID.
              It has participated regularly in anti-government
              demonstrations. The
              Supreme Electoral Council decided Etica y Transparencia
              did not meet
              the criteria of independence and impartiality normally
              expected of
              election observers. Etica y Transparencia is a local group
              of
              Transparency International one of the plethora of
              multinational NGOs
              promoting the political agenda of imperialist
              globalization.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">In
              its recent report on the municipal elections held on
              November 9<sup>th</sup>
              (and January 18<sup>th</sup>
              for seven municipalities in Nicaragua's northern Atlantic
              Coast)
              Etica y Transparencia presented evidence of what they are
              calling
              “irregularities” in 33 municipalities - that is, some
              events that
              may or may not amount to electoral fraud, depending on
              one's
              interpretation of them, in 21% of the country's 153
              municipalities -
              not one third as Burbach states. So now, after having for
              months
              alleged massive, wholesale, indisputable nationwide fraud,
              even the
              US embassy's main vehicle for destabilizing the Nicaraguan
              electoral
              process has in effect admitted that they were wrong. Their
              report is
              a lame attempt to justify the substantial funding they
              received from
              donors like USAID and their parent Transparency
              International.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach
omits
              to note that 150 international independent election
              observers
              from all over Latin America– all electoral professionals
              with
              current or recent experience of organizing elections-
              participated in
              the municipal elections of November 9<sup>th</sup>.
              They reported that the elections were free, fair and very
              well
              organized. So one is left with the choice of who to
              believe : a USAID
              funded outfit clearly identified with the Nicaraguan
              political
              opposition which was not directly involved in the election
              process or
              genuinely impartial electoral professionals from all over
              Latin
              America and the Caribbean who worked with the national
              authorities
              throughout the whole electoral process.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach:
“After
              the election, militant demonstrations erupted in
              Nicaragua’s
              two largest cities, Managua and León, and were quickly put
              down with violence.”&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">This
              is a sly and false account of actual events. Watching
              Canal 2 - the
              main opposition TV channel – and its coverage for the day
              after the
              municipal elections, one saw Eduardo Montealegre call on
              about 800 of
              his supporters in Managua to march to the Supreme
              Electoral Council
              in protest against what he regarded as the wrong result.
              Along the
              way one saw opposition supporters gratuitously attack FSLN
              supporters, while the opposition channel's commentator
              remarked “how
              sad that violence has returned to Nicaragua...” That
              particular
              opposition provocation ended when riot police arrived.
              Montealegre's
              supporters quickly dispersed.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Subsequently,
opposition
              shock-groups roamed Managua attacking FSLN supporters who
              responded in kind. The worst incident was one in which
              opposition
              supporters attacked an FSLN journalist, stabbed him
              several times and
              tried to set him on fire. When Montealegre and his running
              mate
              ex-Guardia Nacional Enrique Quiñonez announced their
              intention
              to stage a march in León, they and their supporters were
              met
              on the way by FSLN groups. Police tried to keep the rival
              groups
              apart and eventually Montealegre, Quiñonez and their
              supporters withdrew. Burbach's description of these events
              slyly and
              falsely implies that Daniel Ortega used the police to
              repress
              dissent, which is completely untrue.</p>
            <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Likewise,
              Burbach neglects to mention that the MRS and the PLC
              themselves have a
              dismal record of violence. MRS leader Carlos Mejia Godoy
              notoriously
              attacked an FSLN journalist at a public meeting. FSLN
              journalists have
              been assaulted and shot. The only serious violence prior
              to the
              municipal elections of November 9th was the murder of an
              FSLN election
              worker by a member of the&nbsp;PLC opposition party.</span><br

            <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
              Wider
              themes</span>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Apart
from
              these specific inaccuracies and omissions, Burbach spends
              some
              time discussing
              two pet opposition grievances that both turn around the
              journalist
              Carlos Fernando Chamorro. He is a member of one of
              Nicaragua's
              leading oligarchic families who control Nicaragua's most
              important
              press media – the right wing La Prensa daily and the
              centre-right/socialdemocrat El Nuevo Diario daily.
              Chamorro also
              fronts Canal 8's current affairs programmes Esta Noche and
              Esta
              Semana and runs the Confidencial web site covering
              Nicaraguan and regional current affairs.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Ever
              since the failure of Sergio Ramirez and his fellow social
              democrat
              dissidents in the FSLN to hijack the party in 1994 and the
              humiliating defeat of the MRS in the 1996 presidential
              elections
              Chamorro has been a bitter and relentless enemy of Daniel
              Ortega.
              Following yet another humiliating electoral showing by the
              MRS party
              that he supports in the 2006 presidential elections,
              Chamorro has
              worked closely with the MRS leadership to destabilize the
              Nicaraguan
              government, deliberately failing to report the huge
              advances the FSLN
              government has made under the leadership of President
              Ortega.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach
obviously
              sympathises 100% with Chamorro and Chamorro's colleagues.
              Presumably that is why in the two cases directly involving
              Chamorro
              that he dwells on – the property corruption case in Rivas
              and the
              OXFAM-CINCO-MAM political funding case - Burbach omits
              vital facts
              and relevant context so as to prop up his and, ultimately,
              Chamorro's,
              extremely weak case.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The
              main relevant context Burbach omits is the vicious
              campaign of
              personal attacks on Daniel Ortega waged by Chamorro and
              the MRS
              leadership ever since Ortega took office. The US
              solidarity group
              Nicanet and an Italian solidarity group both complained to
              the MRS
              about its long-running publicity campaign accusing Daniel
              Ortega of
              being the same as Anastasio Somoza. MRS banners and street
              painted
              stencils read, “Ortega y Somoza ...la misma cosa” and were
              signed, “Rigoberto Lopez Perez...” who was Somoza's
              assassin.
              Chamorro regularly uses his media outlets to make personal
              attacks on
              Daniel Ortega and on Rosario Murillo, Ortega's wife and
              the person
              responsible for the FSLN government's communications
              strategy.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The
              unmistakable implication of that campaign was that Ortega
              should be
              assassinated too. So it is completely disingenuous of
              Burbach to
              suggest that the MRS leadership or Carlos Fernando
              Chamorro are some
              kind of virtuous innocents. Chamorro, like his friends in
              the MRS
              leadership, is a vicious, ruthless political operator busy
              exploiting
              all his international contacts to spread false propaganda
              about
              Nicaragua's FSLN government. Burbach has obliged.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">In
              the Rivas property corruption affair, Burbach neglects to
              inform his
              readers that Armel Gonzalez, Alejandro Bolaños and their
              partners were caught up in complicated land deals in which
              local
              rural workers allege their cooperative was defrauded of
              its land.
              Carlos Fernando Chamorro has never made clear what his own
              relationship or that of his family to those property deals
              may have
              been. The fact that he eventually let the matter go rather
              than
              pursuing it to the bitter end is telling in that
              regard.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach
suggests
              that the affair indicates serious corruption in the
              current
              FSLN government. He writes “FSLN functionaries tried to
              extort $4
              million from Armel González”. Chamorro's programme in fact
              only directly implicated one minor FSLN government
              official, Gerardo
              Miranda, a consul for Nicaragua in Costa Rica and former
              FSLN deputy
              in the National Assembly. Nicaragua's own independent
              audit
              institution, the Contraloria General, which routinely
              audits all public
              institutions, recently issued a report in
              which they stated they had not needed to process any cases
              against
              government officials for corruption in more than 18
              months. Burbach
              has raked up a single unconvincing case from the earliest
              days of the
              Ortega government to try and help Chamorro smear the FSLN
              government
              now.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach
also
              neglects to note that Nicaragua's Pacific Coast in general
              and
              the coast in the department of Rivas in particular has
              been notorious
              in the past for its association with organised narcotics
              trafficking.
              Burbach
              implies that FSLN media characterizations of Carlos
              Fernando Chamorro
              are unfair. But if Chamorro wants to throw mud, he should
              hardly be
              surprised when his victims throw some of it back.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The
              other case Burbach's article dwells on is the case
              involving foreign
              donor funding channelled through Chamorro's CINCO
              non-profit to the
              MRS political party's member organization the Movimiento
              Autonomo de
              Mujeres. Burbach does not mention that MAM is part of the
              MRS. But
              the nub of this case is the issue of foreign funding being
              abused for
              domestic political purposes. The leader of the MAM is a
              long-standing
              local feminist caudillo, Sofia Montenegro. She is also a
              member of
              the board of Chamorro's non profit, CINCO.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">The
              political base of the MRS party is overwhelmingly in the
              NGO and
              non-profit sector. Foreign governments, the United States
              and
              European Union governments above all, have supported
              Nicaraguan NGOS
              who are opposed to the Nicaraguan government. Various
              umbrella groups
              have served to coordinate that opposition, the USAID
              funded
              Movimiento por Nicaragua, the Coordinadora Civil and
              lately the Union
              Ciudadana por la Democracia, apparently funded by the
              right wing
              German Konrad Adenauer Foundation.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">In
              October 2008, the government reviewed the compliance of
              the country's
              4300 or so non-profits in relation to reporting
              requirements,
              validity of executive boards and proper use of funds. The
              Ministry of
              Government found that 400 organizations were not in
              compliance and
              focused on the status and activities of about a dozen of
              those. In
              particular, they asked the Public Prosecutor to
              investigate the use
              of funds – the actual sum turned out to be around
              US$170,000 - from
              foreign donor countries paid via Oxfam to CINCO and then
              passed on to
              Sofia Montenegro's party politically aligned MAM.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">Burbach
correctly
              reports that the police visited CINCO's offices and
              removed
              items containing information they required for the Public
              Prosecutor's investigation. Burbach neglects to explain
              that they did
              so because Chamorro and Montenegro refused to cooperate
              with the
              investigation. All the other organizations who were asked
              to help
              with the investigations did so. Only CINCO and MAM refused
              to. One
              wonders what would have happened to non-profits in the
              United States
              that refused to cooperate with a federal investigation
              into possible
              abuse of funds from a foreign donor for political
              purposes. The
              omission of that context makes it impossible for Burbach's
              readers to
              realise that Chamorro and his friends in the MRS
              leadership
              consistently and deliberately provoke set pieces so as to
              be able to
              claim persecution and thus further their false accusations
              that Daniel
              Ortega is
              an authoritarian tyrant.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;">If
              one steps away from Burbach's propaganda screed and looks
              at what the
              FSLN government has in fact achieved in Nicaragua, the
              insignificance
              and irrelevance of the Nicaraguan opposition and of
              disingenuous
              foreign
              apologists like Roger Burbach, Ignacio Ramonet, Noam
              Chomsky and the
              rest, from the point of view of Nicaragua's population is
              very clear.
              Here is a brief list
              of the FSLN government's record in just two years:<br>

              could go on and on listing achievements. But even this

              list gives an idea of the range and reach of the
              government's
              programmes in just two years. The comparison with previous
              governments in Nicaragua – Violeta Chamorro, Arnoldo
              Aleman and
              Enrique Bolaños - is thoroughly invidious, a complete
              indictment of their incompetence and corruption. It makes
              the
              Nicaraguan opposition look completely clueless. It makes
              their
              apologists look like idiots. In Burbach's case that
              judgment is
              probably too kind. He had access to all the facts and
              deliberately
              chose not to give a true and fair account of them. His
              article
              amounts to State Department propaganda at two removes.</p>
            <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Maybe
              Burbach's action-painting smear-job on the FSLN government
              in Nicaragua
              is just a kind of one-off Gidean acte gratuit.
              But&nbsp;its timing
              -
              when the Nicaraguan government is making progress
              renegotiating foreign
              development cooperation from the European Union that has
              been
              suspended&nbsp;subject to review - is highly opportune for
              the
              Nicaragua's opposition attempts to damage the FSLN
              government's ability
              to fund its programme readily. A recent switch in emphasis
              by
              opposition propagandists like Gioconda Belli has dropped
              the absurd and
              unconvincing "Ortega and Somoza are the same thing" line.
              Now the line
              is
              "Nicaragua is not a dictatorship...yet".</span><br
              style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
            <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
              tune with that propaganda shift, Burbach's article, like
              Monica
              Baltodano's, seems aimed at two things. Firstly,
              it&nbsp;contributes to
              putting pressure on the Nicaraguan government to concede
              more than it
              might in current negotiations. Secondly, it contributes to
              encouraging
              Western Bloc governments to make fewer concessions than
              they otherwise
              would. But Western Bloc governments are in a
              dilemma.&nbsp;They&nbsp;run the risk&nbsp; of becoming
              even
              more&nbsp;irrelevant in terms of their ability to
              influence
              Nicaragua's
              economy and society than they and their proxies in the
              Nicaraguan
              opposition&nbsp;already are. <br>
              <br>
              Burbach has chosen to side with
              Nicaragua's social democrat bourgeois elite. That elite
              has never won
              more than about 7% support in any national election.
              Rather than ally
              with the FSLN to transform Nicaragua on behalf of the
              country's
              impoverished majority, they have chosen to ally themselves
              with the
              country's
              extreme right wing opposition parties. Their key strategy
              has been to
