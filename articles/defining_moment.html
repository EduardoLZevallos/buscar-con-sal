<br>
The
coup in Honduras has made it clearer than ever that&nbsp;rich country
corporate media and their regional media partners deliberately
misinform and disinform. Over the last year, events like the municipal
elections in Nicaragua, Israel's genocidal war on Gaza, the elections
in Lebanon and in Iran have all demonstrated the deep-rooted cynicism
and hypocrisy of Western Bloc governments and of the corporate media so
resolutely at their service. <br>
<br>
That cynicism and hypocrisy is
steadily tainting progressive media too. On Nicaragua, Iran, Gaza and
Honduras progressive coverage and debate tends to be framed heavily in
terms defined by the mainstream corporate media. Solidarity with Hamas
and Hizbollah, for example, or with the FSLN in Nicaragua is generally
looked at askance. Few independent voices get to be heard. Those that
do, struggle against the vast background noise of a media agenda
defined essentially by Western Bloc governments, most importantly that
of the United States.<br>
<br>
Limited coverage of what has been
happening in Honduras has appeared in English. Mostly relating to
events around the coup on June 28th with scrappy bits and pieces of
context. Little has been published in relation to the events of the
week as they affect the tens of thousands of people protesting against
the coup d'etat. Both adequate context and accurate-as-possible up to
date information are necessary to get a good idea of what the coup in
Honduras means.<br>
<br>
General background <br>
<br>
The defining factor
in the history of Honduras through the 20th century was its decisive
subordination to the economic and political interests of the United
States. Sam Zemurray of the Cuyamel Fruit Company famously declared
that it was cheaper to buy a parliamentary deputy in Honduras than a mule. That
venality and corruption in the Honduran political system facilitated
the domination of US corporate and strategic interests. The current
coup d'etat offers a grim reprise of that history. <br>
<br>
As in the
rest of Central America, the natural resources of Honduras - its land,
its metals, its timber &#8211; were plundered ruthlessly by US companies
together with their local Honduran allies in the country's land owning
and business oligarchy. Just prior to the 1954 CIA coup against the
reformist government of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala, a mass strike in
Honduras mobilized industrial and rural workers throughout the country
to demand better terms and conditions of employment. <br>
<br>
The
strike was successful and lead to significant advances in social
legislation, especially labor legislation. Women got the right to vote
in 1955. Those advances eventually provoked consternation among the
country's oligarchy and armed forces. <br>
<br>
In 1963, the army lead a
coup against the centrist President Ramon Villeda Morales, accusing him
of leading the country into communism. The resulting government was
recognized by President Lyndon Johnson. From that coup through the
1960s and 1970s, Honduras took its lead on every important regional
issue in accordance with the exigencies of the US government's regional
policy.<br>
<br>
In the 1980s, with John Negroponte as the US proconsul
in the country's capital Tegucigalpa, ably abetted by current US
ambassador to Managua, Robert Callahan, Honduras was run as a police
State under the fanatical control of General Alvarez Martinez. Amnesty
International's report for the period was entitled &#8220;Civilian Authority:
Military Power&#8221;. Hundreds of people suffered forced disappearance.
Torture was routine. Forced recruitment by the army was habitual.
Honduras became a base for the corrupt narcotics-linked
counterrevolutionary terror war against the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua.<br>
<br>
Less extreme senior officers in the Honduran army
reacted against Alvarez Martinez and forced him into exile in 1984. The
repression eased somewhat, with fewer murders and disappearances. But
torture and forced recruitment remained constant features of the
country's security policy. Likewise, virtually unconditional support
continued for the US government's terror war against Nicaragua.<br>
<br>
After
the 1990 election in Nicaragua, and through the subsequent decade,
national politics in Honduras tended to turn around issues of poverty
reduction, economic progress and social problems, especially crime. The
government of the relatively progressive Carlos Roberto Reina enabled a
re-examination of the period of the dirty war under Alvarez Martinez.
But neither under Reina nor under the subsequent governments of Carlos
Flores Facussé or Ricardo Maduro did government policy seriously
address the country's deep social and economic problems. <br>
<br>
Manuel
Zelaya served in the governments of both Carlos Reina and Flores
Facussé. Under Flores Facussé, he coordinated reconstruction following
the devastating Hurricane Mitch. He has a solid understanding of the
deep structural problems that keep most of the country's population in
poverty. Apart from those deep structural issues perhaps the most
dramatic&nbsp;social problem in Honduras is the gang phenomenon which has
reached intractable proportions over the last decade.<br>
<br>
The government of Manuel Zelaya<br>
<br>
Manuel
Zelaya took office as President in January 2006. Immediately, and
surprisingly, he managed to push through the reactionary legislature &#8211;
the Congreso Nacional &#8211; the Law of Citizens' Participation. From the
start, he regarded efforts towards active consultation and
participation of ordinary Hondurans in the decisions that affected
their lives as a fundamental tool necessary to implement his programme.
As regards poverty reduction, he and his colleagues became increasingly
frustrated at the lack of support in terms of resources from the
international structures of aid and development.<br>
<br>
Despite being a
beneficiary of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative and other
debt relief measures, wiping out around US$4 billion of onerous foreign
debt,&nbsp; Zelaya felt rightly that progress on poverty reduction
in
Honduras was unacceptably slow. When he sought cooperation from the
rich countries, their response was either tepid or negative. For
example, here's a State Department press release on a meeting President
Bush held with Manuel Zelaya back in September 2006, only a few months
after Zelaya had taken office.<br>
<br>
"Zelaya and Bush also discussed
the energy situation in Honduras. Honduras is one of the Western
Hemisphere nations most dependent on imported oil, including oil to
generate electricity, (Dan) Fisk said. "This is something of great
concern to President Zelaya and Hondurans," he explained, "President
Zelaya wanted to give the President a brief on his thinking on how to
proceed on this and to offer (President Zelaya's) proposal to create a
mechanism to try to lower energy costs." The White House official said
that Bush's response to the Honduran leader stressed the importance of
relying on market mechanisms and of limits on government interference.
Bush also reaffirmed his strong interest in considering alternative
sources of fuel and energy, discussed ethanol and other fuel
alternatives, and encouraged Central Americans to explore how sugar
cane can be converted into ethanol.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Put briefly, Zelaya asked
Bush for help with his energy problems and Bush offered him nothing.
That disappointment for Zelaya occurred at a time when, from 2006 into
2007, he found himself taking on foreign oil companies and their local
allies who operated unfair practices distorting fuel prices in
Honduras. That long drawn out episode lead to sharp exchanges with the
US ambassador &#8211; a sign of awkward relations that have cooled
progressively ever since. Also in 2007, President Zelaya's government
opened up diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in over 40
years.<br>
<br>
Zelaya's efforts to lower fuel prices eventually lead him
to join the Venezuelan and Cuban inspired energy security initiative,
Petrocaribe, in December 2007. Later, ever more concerned to secure
access to resources for rural and agricultural development, literacy
and health care as well as resources to promote energy and food security,
Zelaya decided to join ALBA &#8211; the Venezuelan and Cuban led Bolivarian
Alliance for the Americas. Honduras joined ALBA in July 2008.<br>
<br>
That
move confirmed to the United States government and its local allies in
the Honduran landowning and business oligarchy that Zelaya and his
colleagues were determined to break out of the country's traditional
dependence on and submission to the United States in the matter of
foreign policy. Zelaya had already bitterly criticized the United
States for its immigration policy towards Central American migrants. He
had also broached the idea of using the Palmerola-Soto Cano US air base
near Comayagua as the main international airport for Honduras.<br>
<br>
He
was also a fervent support of Central American integration with a view
to creating a stronger voice for the region in international affairs.
However, it is easy to forget that at the same time Zelaya had been in
talks with Guatemala and Mexico about how to develop the Plan Puebla
Panama Initiative. Along with Tony Saca of El Salvador and Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua, Zelaya enthusiastically promoted
the&nbsp;various
initiatives of the CA-4 group in the Central American Integration
System, such as lifting migration controls and easing customs
formalities.<br>
<br>
While Zelaya alienated the traditional
overseers of his country's destiny in the United States, he also
antagonized powerful domestic interests. In May 2007, he forced 10
radio and television stations to broadcast for a period ten days daily
bulletins informing the population of government programmes and
activities on behalf of the impoverished majority. Later, towards the
end of 2007, Zelaya's government made clear they intended to increase
the country's minimum wage. This measure was fiercely criticized and
resisted by the country's employers' organizations.<br>
<br>
At the end
of 2008, Zelaya increased the minimum wage for large sectors of the
Honduran work force from an average of around US$180 to US$289 (5,500
lempiras) in urban areas and US$213 (4055 lempiras) in rural areas. The cost of the
basic basket of food in Honduras then was US$325 (6200 lempiras) Zelaya
said to employers, &#8220;you can employ someone but you cannot tell them
they can only eat twice a day. It cannot be like that. It cannot be
permitted that people get hired at a cost less than that necessary to
be able to eat.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The period up to the crisis of June 24th-28th 2009<br>
<br>
For
all those reasons and more, the political establishment in Honduras,
dominated by business and landowning interests irremediably submissive
to the country's traditional alliance with and dependence on the United
States worked to undermine President Zelaya. Zelaya has been
criticized, perhaps accurately, for having tended to abandon the
essential networking necessary to sustain his grass roots support in
the Liberal Party political machine. While Zelaya was distracted by
wider problems, mediocre opportunists like the leader of the current
coup, Roberto Micheletti, dedicated themselves to shoving supporters of
Zelaya to the margins inside the Liberal Party. <br>
<br>
Much coverage
of Manuel Zelaya describes him as &#8220;leftist&#8221;. The uselessness of that
label, and the foolish &#8220;pink tide&#8221; cliché analysis that tends to
accompany it, is self-evident from the facts. Zelaya is an old style
Liberal Party politician, albeit from one of its more progressive
currents. As such, he benefited from the party machine and used it to
become President. His progressive brand of nationalism emphasizes the
need for regional unity and integration across political boundaries.
That emphasis he has shared with politicians as diverse as the right
wing former Salvadoran President, Tony Saca, as well as with Daniel
Ortega and middle-of-the-road President Alvaro Colom of Guatemala.<br>
<br>
The
immediate pretext of the coup was Zelaya's attempt to hold a
consultative vote on whether or not to propose to the Honduran
electorate in the November 2009 national elections the possibility of a
Constituent Assembly. That process was based on the very same Law of
Citizen's Participation passed by the Congreso Nacional early in 2006.
Zelaya's government received nearly 500,000 petitions requesting to be
consulted on the possibility of establishing a Constituent Assembly to
review the country's constitution.<br>
<br>
Events immediately prior to the coup<br>
<br>
Leaders
of the opposition to Zelaya immediately distorted the president's
consultative initiative, mendaciously claiming that he sought
re-election. That claim was taken up and amplified by the international
corporate media. As progress continued towards the consultative vote,
scheduled for Sunday June 28th, the opposition to Zelaya intensified in
the powers of State controlled by the country's oligarchy &#8211; the
legislature and the Supreme Court. A lower circuit court ruled that the
consultative vote was illegal &#8211; thereby encroaching directly and
unconstitutionally on the powers of the Executive. <br>
<br>
The
generals of the armed forces used that ruling to justify their refusal
to obey a Presidential order to distribute the ballot boxes and ballot papers
necessary for the consultative vote. In the face of that constitutional
crisis, President Zelaya lead a demonstration of over 1000 people to
the airbase where the voting materials had been confiscated. As
Commander-in-Chief of the Honduran armed forces, Zelaya ordered the
base commander to hand over the materials. The officer obeyed. The
materials were then distributed to 15000 voting places throughout he
country by organizations of all kinds, including community development
NGOS, trades unions and church groups &#8211; all the organizations that
supported the consultative vote. <br>
<br>
Zelaya announced that he
would dismiss the head of the military high command. In response, the
Supreme Court ruled, even before the formal letter of dismissal had
been presented and in complete contradiction of the country's
constitution, that the dismissal of that officer was unconstitutional.
That moment defined the complicity of the two powers of State &#8211; the
judiciary and the legislature - in a completely illegal technical coup. <br>
<br>
All
that was necessary from that point on to complete a full coup d'etat
was for the armed forces to strike. They did so in the dawn of Sunday
June 28th, acting, in clear violation of the constitution, under the
orders of the political and judicial powers. In the Congreso Nacional,
at noon on that day, Roberto Micheletti read out a forged letter of
resignation from Manuel Zelaya. <br>
<br>
The legislators used that
farce as the basis for a comic operetta vote confirming him as
President until the end of Manuel Zelaya's term. But the basis of the
coup government is the complicity of the armed forces who forcibly
abducted and expelled the legitimate President Manuel Zelaya. By doing
so the coup plotters violated fundamental articles of the Honduran
constitution which in its first few articles explicitly condemns and
excludes the use of armed force to take power:<br>
<br>
&#8220;Article 3.- No
one owes obedience to a usurper government nor to those who assume
public office or functions by armed force or using ways and procedures
that violate or ignore what this Constitution and the laws establish.
The actions validated by such authorities are null. The people has the
right to take recourse to insurrection in defence of the constitutional
order.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The coup and its sequel to date<br>
<br>
Now, because the
country is under a State of Siege with fierce repression of news media
loyal to President Zelaya, it is almost impossible to get anything like
a complete picture or detailed account of what is happening nationally.
Still numerous local sources of information confirm many things that
merit reporting are:<br>
<br>- the illegal armed assault on President Zelaya's house, his abduction
and forced expulsion to Costa Rica<br>
- the
illegal armed assault on Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas, and on the
Venezuelan, Cuban and Nicaraguan ambassadors who attempted to
physically protect her <br>&#8211; the abduction of Rodas and her subsequent
expulsion to Mexico<br>
- the suspension of fundamental liberties by the
coup regime affecting the rights to due process, habeas corpus, freedom
of association and freedom of expression<br>- the imposition of a State of Siege throughout the country with an
evening to dawn curfew<br>
- reliable reports of hundreds of detentions across the whole country
with some people disappeared<br>
- reliable
reports of hundreds of people injured in constant protest
demonstrations around the country especially in the main cities San
Pedro Sula, Tegucigalpa and La Ceiba<br>
- at least two deaths at the hands of the security forces<br>
- the
militarization of local municipal offices in towns with mayors loyal to
President Zelaya, like Sonaguera in the department of Atlantida<br>
- illegal persecution of those mayors loyal to President Zelaya, for
example in San Pedro Sula and in Tocoa<br>- widespread
forced recruitment of youths by the army in rural communities and in
marginal urban barrios, including children as young as 10 years old<br>
- forced displacement of families regarded as supporters of Manuel Zelaya
in rural areas in the department of Atlantida<br>- machine gunning of vehicles carrying protesters so as to terrorize the
occupants and render the vehicles unusable<br>- persistent suppression of news media opposed to the coup<br>- the national teachers' strike affecting all schools in Tegucigalpa's
public education system<br>- intimidation of employees and students to make them take part in
pro-government demonstrations<br>- persecution of members of the government of Manuel Zelaya still in
Honduras<br>
- persecution of up to 100 Nicaraguans in Honduras on the pretext that
they are in the country to subvert the government<br>
<br>
Media coverage<br>
<br>
Foreign
news media have not reported these events and their context either
accurately or fairly. Among other inaccuracies, one especially
pernicious has been the lie that Zelaya sought re-election. This lie
was constantly repeated. A tiny handful of writers have worked to try
and give a true and fair view of events in Honduras over the last week.
<br>
<br>
If it had not been for the Venezuelan news channel Telesur, a
great deal of what has been reported would simply never have reached as
wide a global audience as has in fact been achieved. The role of the
main North American and European news media has been uniformly
deplorable. The comparison with what happened in Iran is dramatically
telling. The double standard is obvious. Human rights violations and
alleged wrongdoing and by US enemies are magnified. Those by regional
US allies are minimized.<br>
<br>
One can say unequivocally now that the
foreign news coverage by corporate media of the Western countries overwhelmingly
serves the foreign policy agendas of their governments. But the main
sites of the progressive and alternative Western media have also been
extremely disappointing. Even when they have published accurate
accounts and fact-based analysis, with very few exceptions these have
stuck to the mainstream corporate media framework, providing little
context, tending to understate the global significance of the events
occurring in Honduras and often equivocal about the role of President
Obama and his functionaries. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
One can also say that the
progressive or alternative media in those countries are steadily
rendering themselves largely irrelevant. Perhaps it has always been
like that. They often falsely legitimize the mainstream view, as in the
case of the municipal elections in Nicaragua in 2008 and the national
elections in Iran this year. Fact-based analysis that contradicts their
consensus view is often censored and excluded in just the same way as
takes place in the corporate mainstream media. That was certainly the
case in their coverage of that electoral crisis in Nicaragua.<br>
<br>
But
the essential point about almost all the media coverage seems to be
that very very few outlets clearly explained the reason for the
proposed consultative vote. Consequently, they were unable to explain
convincingly the reason for he coup. This nitty gritty of the story
tended to get lost in often tendentious comment. Another telling point
is that these supposedly alternative media almost uniformly failed to
give their readers a list of news sources - either in English or
Spanish - from which to get information about what was happening &#8211; a good
indication of their general narcissism.<br>
<br>
Just to recap, the
reason for the consultative vote, at the request of almost 500,000
petitions, was to suggest the possibility of a constituent assembly
under the government to be elected on November 29th, so as to be able
to discuss a more participative way of involving the people of Honduras
in decision taking. The business and landowning elite in the country
dreaded an affirmative result from the vote for that proposal. They,
like their patrons in the US government, fear and reject change That is
why they staged the coup.<br>
<br>
The role of the United States<br>
<br>
The
historical role of the United States in Honduras has always been a
reactionary one. President Franklin D. Roosevelt supported the military
dictator General Carias Andino all through the 1930s. The US government
supported the Honduran government's attempts to crush the great workers
strike of 1954. We seem now to be reverting to Roosevelt's &#8220;Good
Neighbour&#8221; policy. The coup has been frowned on by President Obama, but
little has been done to squash it. The US government seems unable to
shake its recidivist historical affinity to corporate-friendly
repressive regimes.<br>
<br>
The US government supported the military coup of 1963
against the moderate reformist President Ramon Villeda Morales. In the
1980s, the US authorities virtually imposed the National Security State
regime, dominated by General of Alvarez Martinez. US ambassador John
Negroponte oversaw the dirty war Alvarez Martinez imposed on the
Honduran people between 1982 and 1984. Subsequently the US government
and its representatives in the World Bank and the IMF imposed the
grotesquely unjust arrangements of the Washington Consensus on Honduras.<br>
<br>
The
extremely limp condemnation by Obama administration officials, by
President Obama himself and by Secretary of State Clinton is very
clearly geared to waste time and promote spurious &#8220;dialogue&#8221;. It was
clear from day one of the coup that the US hopes to be able to
recognize the new government that will result from the presidential
elections scheduled for November 29th this year. The United States has
not initiated any diplomatic initiative to condemn the coup. It is
Latin American countries that have made the running. <br>
<br>
The US
has tagged grudgingly along. While other countries have withdrawn their
ambassadors &#8211; even the consummately hypocritical Europeans felt
compelled to do so &#8211; the United States has not. Other measures have
been taken &#8211; like the alleged suspension of military cooperation or the
announced suspension of funding from the IMF and the World Bank which
presumably required the OK of the US Treasury. But these moves will do
little to affect the usurper regime in the short term and will almost
certainly be reversed once a newly elected&nbsp; President takes
power
in just a few months.<br>
<br>
So in practice the US government has done
little - and that in the most unconvincing way - to move against and
reverse the coup in Honduras. Obama administration officials readily
acknowledge US government functionaries consulted with the individuals
plotting the coup &#8211; supposedly trying to dissuade them. Such
disinformation is impossible to take seriously. The more so since what
has not been heard is a clear statement that the US government will not
recognize any government resulting from this rupture of the
constitutional order in Honduras. That is a fundamental principle on
which Latin American governments are insisting<br>
<br>
The Bolivarian Alliance of the peoples of the Americas<br>
<br>
In
that regard, the role of the ALBA governments in the international
political and diplomatic sphere has been as decisive as the integral
corresponding role played by Telesur in the media sphere. The
Bolivarian Alliance of the peoples of the Americas now includes Antigua
and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, St
Vincent and the Grenadines and Venezuela. They form an economic trade
and cooperation bloc of over 76 million people.<br>
<br>
Petrocaribe, a
regional food security and energy security cooperation framework that
is a subsidiary project of the wider ALBA initiative includes, Antigua
and Barbuda,the Bahamas, Belize, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican
Republic, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica,
Nicaragua, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, San Vicente and the
Grenadines, Suriname, Venezuela. The total population of the coutnries
in the Petrocaribe framework is over 90 million. <br>
<br>
The
right-wing writer of the relevant Wikipedia entry disparages the
results of Petrocaribe. That disgracefully skewed Wikipedia account
omits the very important food security initiatives implemented since
May 2008 and fails to acknowledge efforts within the Petrocaribe scheme
to promote the use of renewable energy. The reason countries like
Guatemala, Honduras and soon Costa Rica have been anxious to join
Petrocaribe is that it dramatically improves their public sector cash
flow and frees up tens of millions of dollars for development purposes.
<br>
<br>
So when US government officials and their media shills falsely
allege that Venezuela is destabilizing the region the absurdity is
obvious. If Venezuela is destabilizing the region why have 18 countries
in the region joined Petrocaribe and why have 9 countries in the region
joined ALBA? Overall, 20 countries are members of those two
organizations with a combined population of over 114 million people.
Those countries have every kind of government. In fact the majority of
those governments might be well described as centrist. <br>
<br>
ALBA
represents the future &#8211; a future based on solidarity and cooperation
rather than rivalry and competition. So the ALBA model is a direct and
unanswerable challenge to the failed system of corporate capitalism.
That system now cannot even guarantee people in a country like the
United States access to adequate health care and education. <br>
<br>
One
of its wealthiest states, California, is effectively bankrupt,
implementing vicious cuts in public services. While ALBA and
Petrocaribe free up hundreds of millions of dollars for investment
throughout Central America, the Caribbean and its Andean members. So
ALBA makes the neocolonial debt and aid model look as fake and obsolete
as that model in fact is. <br>
<br>
Faced with that implacable reality,
it seems the United States government and its regional allies have now
resorted to the methods deployed in Venezuela in 2002, in Haiti in
2004, in Bolivia last year. Faced with a new electoral round throughout
Latin America over the next couple of years, they are recreating the
ambience of terror, of fear, of sinister cynicism and hypocrisy that
has always characterized US government policy in Latin America.<br>
<br>
So
far the Honduran coup d'etat has shown up more clearly than ever the
irremediable cynicism of the United States government and the thorough
mendacity of Western corporate media. It has also indicated the virtual
irrelevance of Western alternative media and emphasized the tenuous
validity of international human rights structures. On the other hand it
has demonstrated the dramatic urgency and importance of supporting in
every possible way the positions of the ALBA country governments who
are the only ones with the experience, dynamism, creativity and
imagination to define a successful strategy to defeat the developing
neocolonial offensive.<br>
<br>
One crucial position advanced by the ALBA
bloc of countries is that they will refuse to recognize any government
resulting from the current rupture of constitutional continuity in
Honduras. The&nbsp; United States government must have thought that
neither Manuel Zelaya nor the popular movement in Honduras would resist
the coup so categorically and with such bravery and fortitude. If they
thought that, they have been proved profoundly mistaken. <br>
<br>
Now
the likely US strategy of delaying tactics has been shredded by Zelaya,
by the Honduran people and, crucially, by the ALBA countries forcing the
hand of the Organization of American States. A vital ally has been UN
General Secretary Miguel D'Escoto. A scheduled meeting early this week
between President Manuel Zelaya and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
may well reveal the extent and nature of any commitment to genuine
democracy on the part of President Obama and his administration.<br>
<br>
Todays
events when peaceful demonstrators were fired on by Honduran Army
Special Forces at Tegucigalpa's international airport may well
dramatically polarize the situation. Two protestors were killed,
several were badly wounded. The corporate media are reporting that the
protestors died in &#8220;clashes&#8221;. There were no clashes. Watching the
protest live on Telesur one could see that the protestors were behind
the airport's perimeter fence waiting for the arrival of Manuel Zelaya.
<br>
<br>
They were mercilessly cut down by the cold blooded murderers
the coup have mobilized to terrorize the Honduran people into
submission. But unless the coup regime concedes power to Manuel Zelaya
again, the country may well be only a couple of army murders away from
outright armed conflict. Perhaps the coup leaders have forgotten that
almost every adult male in Honduras in their 30s and 40s will have done
two years military service. They can pull the trigger too.
