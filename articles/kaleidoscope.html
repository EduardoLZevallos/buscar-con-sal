The FSLN has no qualms about maintaining their
objective of reforming the Constitution so that President Daniel Ortega
can
stand
again for president in 2011. Nor does the governing party appear to
doubt its
ability to bring about such reforms despite not having an overall
majority in the National Assembly. <br>
      <br>
Vice President of the
Supreme Court of Justice and one of the most influential members of the
FSLN, Rafael Sol&iacute;s, spoke openly about the governing party's
plans to create the possibility for Ortega's reelection in 2011 in <a
 href="http://www.confidencial.com.ni/politica_653.html">an
extensive interview</a> with online weekly www.confidencial.com.ni. <br>
      <br>
As Sol&iacute;s explains the constitutional reforms the FSLN is
proposing are based on the idea that the law should not
stand in the way of the
population's right to elect, reelect and dismiss public officials as
they choose. Originally the FSLN was talking about promoting a much
more radical change from a presidential system to a parliamentary
system with an Executive branch of government responsible only for
foreign policy, defence and certain economic matters. <br>
      <br>
Due to the apparent difficulty of rounding up enough support among the
political opposition for this project, however, the FSLN is now
proposing a set of reforms which eliminate current leglislative norms
that limit the population's ability to elect or dismiss public
officials as they choose. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FSLN wants option for a recall
referendum </span><br>
      <br>
As well as overturning the constitution's
prohibition of reelection, the proposed reforms would introduce the
figure of a recall referendum whereby, should the population demand
it, such a referendum could be held to remove any public official
from a post at any time during their term.<br>
      <br>
Like all constitutional reforms, the reforms would require a greater
majority (56 of the 91 deputies) than the 47 simple majority
required for other legislation. According to Sol&iacute;s, the FSLN is
actively looking for opportunities to negotiate support for the reforms
from opposition benches in the National Assembly in order to make up
the extra 18 votes it needs to pass the legislative proposal. <br>
      <br>
Interestingly, Sol&iacute;s did
not discard the possibility of some sort of agreement with Eduardo
Montealegre's Democratic Bench should Arnoldo Aleman's PLC continue to
defy the FSLN attempts to negotiate. He appears confident, however,
that at some point during 2010 the
FSLN will be able to pass its constitutional reform proposal with
support from the PLC deputies as part of a wider negotiated agreement
including the naming of 27 top positions in the Supreme Court, Supreme
Electoral Council and other public institutions. <br>
      <br>
Over the last few years the FSLN has demonstrated time and again that,
despite not having an overall majority in the National Assembly, it
does have the upper hand when it comes to this kind of horsetrading (a
systematic and inevitable mechanism in most representative
democracies). <br>
      <br>
While the right wing opposition has
managed to obstruct legislative activity to the detriment of the
governing party on a
couple of occasions during Ortega's presidency, the FSLN has always
ended up
wiggling its way out of seemingly impossible situations by playing
different factions of the opposition against each other and conceding
benefits to opponents when there is no other alternative. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Imminent legislative boycott in
attempt to pressurize FSLN?</span><br>
      <br>
Events over the last few weeks could be taken to suggest that the
political opposition
are planning to resort to paralyzing legislative activity again at some
point
before the end of the year. <br>
      <br>
The opposition knows the FSLN needs to get
a number of important pieces of legislation through parliament over the
next month or so (including its proposed tax reform, important judicial
reforms, a reform to the 2009 budget and the 2010 national budget
proposal) and is unlikely not to take advantage of this opportunity to
frustrate the government and
improve their own personal and party stances v&iacute;s-a-v&iacute;s
future negotiations with the FSLN. <br>
      <br>
Catholic Bishop and notorious right wing reactionary, Abelardo Mata,
has
been making a strong effort to facilitate talks between Aleman and
Montealegre with the expressed objective being the creation of a united
liberal alliance going into the 2011 elections. <br>
      <br>
Last week a verbal
agreement was reached that the PLC and the Democratic Bench would
implement a common agenda in the National Assembly including the
rejection of
the FSLN's constitutional reforms and the ratification of a law to
nullify the 2008 municipal elections. Mata admits, however, that the
meeting took place in an environment of mutual mistrust.<br>
      <br>
Since the meeting several representatives of the opposition parties
have spoken of the resurection of what the opposition refer to as the
"Block Against the Dictatorship." This is the phrase they used to
describe the tactic of legislative boycott employed by opposition
deputies
both at the end of the 2007 and at the end of 2008. <br>
      <br>
It is important to note that this tactic was ultimately unsuccessful
both times,
however, due to the governing party's ability to manipulate the deeply
rooted mistrust and bad feeling between the different right wing
factions in its favour, so bringing an end to the legislative logjam. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Montealegre's vulnerability </span><br>
      <br>
Despite the corporate media's efforts to have us believe otherwise,
Democratic Bench
leader Eduardo Montealegre's negotiating power has experienced a steady
decline since the 2008 municipal elections. Both Montealegre's
credibility and the perception of his leadership potential took serious
blows after his false claims of fraud were followed by an inability to
demonstrate
widespread popular support. <br>
      <br>
Now faced not only with the possibility of being stripped of his
parliamentary
immunity to face prosecution for his involvement in the CENIs scandal,
but also the developing case against him for allegedly failing to pay
millions of cordobas in income tax over the last seven years,
Montealegre appears to be in a more vulnerable position than ever. <br>
      <br>
The leaders of both the FSLN and the PLC have their reasons to
celebrate and promote Montealegre's ongoing political decline. It is in
the interests of the FSLN that the
representative of a vaguely defined but relatively appealing type of
third way option for voters be shown up for what he is - a corrupt
white-collar bureaucrat. Likewise, the weaker one's oponents are, the
more amenable they become to future negotiations.<br>
      <br>
If, as their recent activities based on refounding the image
of the PLC would suggest, Aleman and his inner circle are serious about
competing with the FSLN for political power via the ballot box in 2011,
they need Montealegre out of the way in order for Aleman to emerge as
the sole leader of the only viable right wing political alliance.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Little chance of reconciliation</span>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">between right wing faction</span>s<br>
      <br>
With these factors thrown into the equation it would appear that
Montealegre has little room for maneouvre if an opposition
legislative boycott gives way to the resurrection of the so-called
FSLN-PLC
"pacto" or the creation of a FSLN-Democratic Bench "mini-pacto." <br>
      <br>
Whatever the details of the course of events in the National Assembly
over the next few months, the creation of a steadfast political
agreement between the different right wing factions seems improbable,
especially taking into account the fact that Montealegre's faction is
competing against the PLC as part of an electoral alliance with the ALN
in the
upcoming regional elections on the Caribbean Coast. <br>
      <br>
As long as the opposition and their international supporters do not
decide to
break with conventional electoral politics there seems little
reason to suggest that the FSLN's internal political strategy is likely
to fail them now. </td>
