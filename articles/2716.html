<p>Very good afternoon, compañero. Good afternoon, beloved families of our Blessed Nation.<br />
<br />
What a world we must live in...! What a world it is now up to us to change...! What a world that leads us, day by day, to celebrate Life in the midst of so much mortality. Because we believe in Life. Because we have Faith. Because we have Hope. Because we know that a better World must be built, and that not is it only possible, it is essential...!<br />
<br />
A Better World from these dark hours of struggle for Humanity, because it is a struggle even to be, let alone to live as Human Beings. That is the struggle we wage every day learning to know how to recognize where we fail in our Humanity, that is, to know how to recognize where we fail in our Humanity when it comes to acknowledging in ourselves, each one of us, the duty, the responsibility, as part of the Community that we call Human, the Human Family, to defend the Right of Everyone to live precisely as Human Beings.<br />
<br />
How much has been said about the pain that rages every day in so many families, in so many parts of the world...! How much has been uttered about pain, and about rights that are denied, generating more pain and more suffering, death, tragedy, for so many Human Beings in so many parts of the World!<br />
<br />
How much has been talked about, and still remains unresolved... How many decades of hardship, imposed; of occupation, because that is the word!<br />
<br />
When great Powers occupy or others, in the name of those great Powers, occupy and turn whole territories and the families living there into concentration camps, how much gets talked about and how long it takes us to change, to demand change!<br />
<br />
Resolutions come and resolutions go, but the World stays the same, and Life, like the famous song by Julio Iglesias, remains the same, unfortunately, for so many suffering families and so many brave families, so many heroic families, admirable combative families, all over the world.<br />
<br />
How much violence, how much conflict, how much tragedy, how much heroism... All together!<br />
<br />
Every day we have to live out the commitment to contribute, albeit maybe with just a grain of sand, to change this world of injustice, convulsed by injustice, convulsed by deafness, convulsed by the refusal to recognize the Rights of Everyone. To treat each other as brothers and sisters, as neighbors.<br />
<br />
How much deafness, how much blindness, how much inaction... How much death loaded into the consciousness of so many!<br />
<br />
And today, as we commemorate the 56th anniversary of Che's heroic departure, today we say, we repeat, that our obligation is to feel the pain felt by any Human Being anywhere in the world. And not only to feel it, but to contribute to changing this way of passing through an inhospitable and unjust world. To change the World and to change how people make their way in the World, so as to see, and to hear, and to feel, and to live with Heart. It is not only possible, it is our duty, as Human Beings, as Humanity!<br />
<br />
56 years ago Che Guevara left us the responsibility, the duty, to be heroic every day, contributing by making our way towards indispensable transformations, in the world and in each one of us.<br />
<br />
To build the New Woman, the New Man, how easy it is to say it, how difficult it is to live it, and really, really, to be ourselves, as Gandhi said, to be the change we want to see in the world.<br />
<br />
From this Heroic, Dignified, Sovereign, Combative Nicaragua, our Solidarity, Affection, Respect, for all those Families who suffer all over the World. And, above all, our Solidarity, Love, Affection, Respect, with the Families who are suffering as a result of a conflict prevailing there. Once more, from the United Nations, nothing. Matters are pronounced upon, agreements signed, but nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Our Solidarity, our Affection, our Love, and our Commitment to contribute, with Solidarity, Respect, Affection, Love, with all these Human Beings, like each one of us, mothers, grandmothers, young people, men, women, all those who suffer and all the lives that have been squandered through deafness, to render us as if unable either to see, or hear, or be able to... "With the ears of a fish” is how children here put it.<br />
<br />
How many wasted lives... What a betrayal! To betray so much blood of Human Beings, of innocent families, and to continue so complacently, as if the news were an advertisement for some liquor or other; so complacent, continuing on our way, as if nothing were happening. That is one of the tragedies of this world: We have become so accustomed to pain and misfortune that we become blind, not just blind, but blind, deaf and dumb, unable to act with Spirit, with Sensitivity, with Intelligence, and with Love.<br />
<br />
From this Nicaragua, I repeat, Always Dignified, Sovereign and Always full of Faith, Hope and Love, we make our pronouncement saying: Enough of victims and pain anywhere! Let us be like Che, let's be able to feel the suffering, the pain, and also to see and admire the Heroism, anywhere in the world.<br />
<br />
That's how things are, Compañer@s, as we open this week, also the Anniversary of the beginning of the Sandinista Popular Insurrection.<br />
<br />
October 13th 1977, 46 Years On, and we have indeed Moved On! We have kept going, striving. We have continued advancing, without renouncing the our Right to fight every battle, to be recognized in the example of our General of Free Women and Men; our General Zeledón; our Andrés; our Carlos; our many Heroes and Martyrs. We have fought and we continue to fight, because as long as Nicaragua has children who love her, Nicaragua will remain free.<br />
<br />
46 Years from the start of the Sandinista Popular Insurrection, We are Overcoming and We Will Overcome!<br />
<br />
October 13th and this week we are going to be commemorating, precisely, in San Carlos, commemorating in Ocotal, in Nueva Segovia, commemorating in Masaya, everywhere where the Flames were lit once more. Because any Struggle is like that: The flames are lit, the fights take place, you fight, to win!<br />
<br />
There may be a moment when it seems that the Triumph is not being achieved, but that's because the Triumph gets built day after day, and it is built of struggles, of combats, of never giving up the Right that we have to fight, we said, every Battle, to Continue Winning!<br />
<br />
Never giving up, never abandoning those Battles, those Struggles which have made us great throughout our history, and which continue to make us great thanks to the Legacy of so many Heroes. This is a Country blessed with so much Sacred Blood that now bears fruit in Work, Security, and the Peace that we enjoy, that we defend and that we constantly ratify as the foundation, the very foundation of all the Victories and the Horizons that we deserve, which are those of Progress.</p>
