<p><em><strong>Both internally and in its foreign policy, the current administration of President Donald Trump has proven to be even more criminal than previous US governments. The gradual intensification of measures of repression and censorship against the US population, especially migrant families, corresponds to the gradual loss of former US power and influence around the world. The country’s ruling elites cannot satisfy the aspirations and needs of their population without a redistribution of the country's political power and national wealth, nor can they compensate for the consequences of the decline of their influence around the world without a radical change in their international vision.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, it is clear that the US elites and their European allies have no intention either of changing their counterproductive class war at home or of peacefully accepting the consequences of US decline globally. In the international arena, they are not going to give up their actions to sabotage the development of the majority world led by China, India and Russia. President Donald Trump himself has claimed that the BRICS+ group of countries is an initiative directed against his country, specifically “an attack on the dollar." He recently stated, "Any country that aligns with the anti-American policies of the BRICS will be charged an additional 10% tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy."  </p>

<p>In fact, President Trump is the perfect caricature of the hypocrisy, cynicism and narcissism typical of the ruling elites of the collective West. Although Donald Trump is an extreme example of this mentality, these elites believe that the world must always revolve around their selfish interests and petty concerns. They believe they have the right to punish recalcitrant governments and political movements who refuse to obey their will or who do not prioritize Western interests over the good of their own peoples. Unfortunately for them, NATO’s failed war against Russia in Ukraine and the failure of the US government's tariff war against the People's Republic of China have shown clearly that the world has changed forever.</p>

<p>The specific indicators of this new world reality are:</p>

<p>* the strategic political-military defeat suffered by NATO countries in Ukraine which has depleted US and European military inventories and demonstrated the obsolescence of their military technology;</p>

<p>* the failure of the thousands of illegal Western coercive economic measures against Russia which has intensified the lack of competitiveness of US and European trade and brought their financial system into disrepute;</p>

<p>* the commercial and technological defeat of the collective West at the hands of China, which has overcome all the West’s illicit unilateral measures to curb the development of its high-tech sector;</p>

<p>* the irrelevance of Western naval power given the new overland trade routes on the Eurasian continent and the new sea route in the Arctic;</p>

<p>* the growing influence of China and Russia in Africa and their strategic alliances, both de facto and formal, with countries such as Cuba, Democratic Korea, Iran, Nicaragua and Venezuela, among others;</p>

<p>* the ever closer integration of the huge Eurasian region and the growing development of South-South cooperation through regional and global integration structures such as BRICS+.<br />
Apart from the defeat of NATO in Ukraine and the failure of its unfair trade measures against China, the collective West also has to take into account the effects of the failure of its treacherous military aggression against Iran carried out in the middle of a negotiation process over its legitimate nuclear energy program. This extreme US and European bad faith has shown the majority world that it is impossible to rely on any agreement reached via diplomatic channels with a group of powers so desperate to maintain their unjust former world dominance. In the case of Africa, for example, while President Trump threatens the continent’s countries with unfair new tariffs, China, India, Russia and the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf are increasingly promoting dynamic relations of trade and development cooperation.<br />
 <br />
Faced with the incontrovertible reality of their decline in several important areas relative to China, India and Russia, the US and European elites seem unable to escape from their superiority complex. The mistake they repeat over and over again is to mistake for weakness the willingness to dialogue of the leaders of countries such as Russia, China, Iran or Venezuela, who defend their national dignity and sovereignty within the framework of international law. The fascist elites of the collective West take every sign of goodwill as a confession of weakness and every independent and sovereign action as a challenge that needs to be crushed.  </p>

<p>Western political culture has abandoned the slightest pretense of being committed to democracy or human rights. Now its ruling classes express the classic fascist fusion of political power with the interests of big business. They have ignored and repressed the feelings of their peoples against the support of the Zionist genocide in Palestine and against militarization in preparation for war against Russia or some other perceived threat. In truth, the main threat to the collective West is the rejection by its ruling elites of the basic norms of international law, namely non-aggression and non-intervention. The biggest challenge for Western elites is for them to come to their senses.</p>

<p>On the contrary, they act in constant violation of international law based on the delusion that they can to stop the progressive decline of their global power relative to China and Russia and thus prevent the successful consolidation of the new world order. From this insane perspective, the irrational imperial logic interprets the development by the peoples of the majority world of trade and financial relations independent of the Western economic system as insolent behavior by subordinate countries and inferior peoples. This feeling is what underlies the genocidal blockade of Cuba, the extreme chauvinism against Russia, the open fear of China, the racist complicity in the genocide of the Palestinian people, the treacherous cynicism against Iran and the systematic criminality against Venezuela, among many other examples.</p>

<p>The Western ruling classes are incapable of a rational response to their new disadvantaged situation and revert like unconscious zombies to the historical pattern that has always served them well in the past. They abuse their power in international institutions, ignore the fundamental norms of international law, devise destructive unfair machinations in their bilateral relations and apply genocidal direct aggression against what they regard as easy targets. In the current global context, the collective West faces the multiple challenges identified by its paranoia with their leaders’ habitual aggression because they cannot free themselves from the instinctive reflexes of their superiority complex instilled during centuries of genocidal conquest and enslavement.</p>

<p>Among the most obvious actions of the zombie collective West at the moment are their attempts to:-       </p>

<p>* promote instability and regime change in countries susceptible to their subversion strategies especially in regions around the world hosting China’s extraordinary Belt and Road Initiative;</p>

<p>* deepen the economic dependence and political submission of the economies of vassal countries such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and NATO member countries;</p>

<p>* retain the loyalty of the Arab world in the face of the advance of Eurasian integration which in fact offers more advantageous environments for investment and cooperation than Western alternatives;</p>

<p>* ensure the continuity of the genocidal system of the illegal Zionist occupation of Palestine so as to harass neighboring Arab countries and intimidate the Axis of Resistance against the occupation;</p>

<p>* destabilize or overthrow the government of Iran in order to sabotage the North-South International Transport Corridor which is strategic for Russia and India;</p>

<p>* encourage destabilizing actions around the rebellious Taiwan province of China, in the South China Sea and on the borders of Democratic Korea;</p>

<p>* press India to loosen its historically close relationship with Russia and deter its rapprochement with China;</p>

<p>* destabilize or overthrow the revolutionary governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela to deepen and consolidate Western control of Latin America and the Caribbean;</p>

<p>* destabilize or overthrow independent governments in Africa such as Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger or Zimbabwe to sabotage and impede continental initiatives towards emancipation.</p>

<p>However, the strength and cohesion of the collective West at the domestic level and in its foreign policy is no longer sufficient for the complete realization of all these and other ambitions. In addition, the countries of the majority world observe the changes taking place and cautiously hedge their bets to take advantage of better opportunities for trade and cooperation in the new world order, without antagonizing the narcissistic Western elites. It is a reality with clear and practically inevitable trends due to the fragility of Western countries’ economies. To the extent that they find themselves confronting this reality in practice, the Western ruling elites, instead of reflecting and rethinking, simply deepen their instinctive regression to fascism or to what the prominent economist Michael Hudson has called neo-feudalism.</p>

<p>The terrible human cost of the brutal, sadistic reaction of the collective zombie West to its relative decline only strengthens and consolidates majority popular support for the vision and practice of the political forces in the majority world developing the tremendous potential of their peoples. This phenomenon is reflected in all the countries attacked by the US government and its allies because the governments of these countries prioritize the Common Good of their countries’ majorities and want a world of justice and peace based on mutual respect. As our Co-President Compañera Rosario has said, this is a "Great Fraternity that fights and overcomes, all of us have fought and continue to overcome, creating Together a New, Better World of Joy, Justice, Work and Friendship. A World of Peace, Peace, Peace...!”</p>
