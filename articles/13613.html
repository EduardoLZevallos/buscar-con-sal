after the ceremony of the XXIV Graduation of the of National Police Cadets</strong></em></h3>

<h3><em><strong>December 16, 2021</strong></em></h3>

<p><br />
<img alt="" height="500" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/321229.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="400" />A very good evening, Compañer@s. A day, an afternoon, an evening, as every day, every afternoon, every evening, dedicated to strengthening Peace, in the words of our Commander Daniel and in practice every day, that is the focus of our Lives.</p>

<p>We who have seen Peace violated by vandalism, terrorism, which now find Justice in these Times... there is Justice against vandals and terrorists, we know how transcendental and fundamental it is for a Society and a Country to live in Peace. Because only living in Peace, living with calm do we have our guaranteed Right to work, to study, to take care of our Health, to produce, to prosper. Only in Peace, which is also Stability, can we study, work, produce, prosper.</p>

<p>We say that we are a People with the Strength of Victories, Strength of Spirit, Strength of Victories, and we say that every day, when we commit ourselves to strengthen Peace, we commit ourselves to strengthen Unity, because it is through Union that we guarantee Peace.</p>

<p>Some have wanted to promote disunity and division among Nicaragua's Families, which is a crime, a sacrilege, speaking in terms of our Culture of Faith. To separate, to divide, to beat others, to sow malicious division, is a sacrilege that threatens the Values, the Principles and the Practices of Christian Fraternity, of Love to the Neighbor, of Solidarity.</p>

<p>This afternoon we have seen with much Pride the Graduation of Brothers and Sisters who have studied in the Academy that bears the name of the Hero Walter Mendoza, and who have dedicated their Graduation to our National Hero, from whom Sandino learned so much and who inspired Sandino so much: General Benjamin Zeledon!</p>

<p>And we have seen in the Compañeros and Compañeras here with their Families, who represent also all the Brothers and Sisters who have graduated throughout this year in different Specialties of Citizen Security, to serve our Families, to guarantee the Good Life in our Nicaragua. And to all of them, our affection, our Respect and our Recognition.</p>

<p>We know that they are Heroes, because, regardless of the fact that they are Young, they have taken a heroic attitude. Because they know that being in the Police is to serve the country's Families, and at the risk of their own Life, to guarantee the Security and the Tranquility of all our Homes and Communities.</p>

<p>Admirable, admirable, just as admirable also are our Soldiers, ensuring Sovereign Security, the Army of Nicaragua, and do so many Companions in all the Institutions of Citizen Security, Sovereign Security, and Security also in front of any natural event, those of the Interior Ministry and the Fire Service.</p>

<p>We were saying earlier that we will be commemorating the Anniversary, although belatedly...  but it is never too late to pay tribute to so many comrades who dedicate their time and energy, on many occasions unable to see their families... Time and energy given at all hours every day, safeguarding all our Families, in front of the disasters, untoward events, calamities... Let's all take care of each other !</p>

<p>We will be commemorating 49 Years, celebrating also, because for everything, for all Life and Miracles, we should be grateful to Our Father. That event was a moment of great pain and many families who lost loved ones know it. I know of families that lost 4 or 5 people, in their hearts, the family is the heart of everyone, but we carried on, even while living under that criminal tyranny imposed by the Yankees in our Nicaragua.</p>

<p>But we went forward. And the Revolution triumphed, which was the Triumph of Nicaragua's Freedom and Dignity and Sovereignty, even following a tragedy like that... The number of victims was hidden from us, but we know that there were tens of thousands of people who lost their lives in the earthquake.</p>

<p>We are entering the 50th Anniversary Year, 50 Years after that painful event, truly tragic. And after all, we are familiar with tragedies and we know how to overcome them and keep moving forward. And I have always said that this is the Fruit of Faith, the Faith we have in God, the Faith we have in all our Saints that we honor in our Homes. And the Families that have taken up the Religion that they call Evangelical, the Christian, Protestant Religion, that have their own services, cults which very respectable ways of invoking God, because we are all children of God, and some do so in their own Churches, others in other Churches, but all of us are in this Blessed Nation full of Grace thanks to Trust in God, thanks to Our Lord.</p>

<p>In this Nation we invoke, according to our various Beliefs and Practices, but always the same God, God the Father, who blesses us all, and gives us that Faith which allows us to always trust in God.</p>

<p>Faith is what always allows us to transcend pain and tragedy.</p>

<p>It is with Faith and Spiritual Strength that we transcended the terrible events of April 2018. With what Faith and what Strength ! Because we know, and we affirm every day, God does not approve Evil, God does not bless those who do Evil. God blesses and blesses us all, as his children, because we practice, as we should practice, Love between one another, Fraternity, and the search and the desire for Justice in our daily lives.</p>

<p>Life with Well-being, a Just Life, living together and sharing, as Families, as Sisters and Brothers, that is the Mandate of the Father, of Christ Jesus, and it is the Mandate with which we are make our way, advancing towards Better Times, with the Certainty that gives us our Faith and our Confidence in the Ways ahead, which are of Concord, which are of Work, which are of Security, and Victories.</p>

<p>Simple, humble, daily victories, small steps forward of our Nicaraguan families, that we take together, because it is together, all of us together that we go forward, all of us together defending Peace every day, defending Love every day. Defending Peace with Love while we continue working, studying and prospering. United in Prosperity !</p>

<p>Here the People is President. Here the People confirmed that it is still President, and every day, in every corner of this Blessed Nation, Forever Free, we know that our People bless and thank God for the Progress, for the Housing, the Highways, the Roads, the Bridges; for the Programs supporting Small Businesses, supporting the Family Economy, the Creative Economy, Agricultural Production... All of that we are doing together!</p>

<p>I say constantly that here all the Triumphs are of our People. Because, what else would we do? Although we may have a Good Government, if the People are not in the Government, it is just an Institution and where is it's Institutionality? Here there is Protagonism of our People. Here our People are present. Here our People is President. Here our People rules, and here we must continue listening to its Mandate, seeking solutions to the problems that always exist, and moving forward, as we said, with Faith, with Affection, in Fraternity and Solidarity.</p>

<p>May we all have a Good Weekend. Let us go toward the 24th, next week, feeling happy, blessed, when we see the Children with their toys, when we see the Nativity Scenes, the expressions of our Sacred Beliefs; when we see this Ambience, when we feel this Ambience, with the Aromas of Christmas Eve, the Aromas of New Year's Eve, and this Ambience that augurs a Good Year for us all.</p>

<p>We embrace all our Families, as one Nicaraguan Family, we embrace in the certainty that great things and Miracles will continue to come, because God blesses us, God loves us, and because we know for sure that this is a Country where all of us, united as Sisters and Brothers, are making our way forward, in Faith, Family and Community!</p>

<p>Thank you, Compañeros. Thank you very much.</p>
