<br />
Good evening, Comrades; Beloved Families, Beloved Mothers of Families, Fathers, who live supporting their Families; young men and women, Grandmothers, Grandfathers, Brothers and Sisters all.<br />
<br />
These events are always complex, in the emotional sense, because on the one hand we feel the great Pride of being Nicaraguans, by the Grace of God, and of having lived and traveled, grateful to God, all these Paths of Nationhood and Freedom, of Nationhood and Dignity, of Nationhood and Strength, of our Nation, our Struggles and Victories.<br />
<br />
All the difficult times this Nation has known, where the Strength of the People wins through every day. Difficult times at different moments! And when we speak of Difficult Times, we know that they are also Glorious Times, because in Difficult Times we learn the Character, the Courage, the Nobility, the Capacity, the Fortitude and the Love for our Neighbor that is confirmed in their service, in the capacity and in the disposition to give our Life for the Nation, for the Family, for our children, for the Future.<br />
<br />
In difficult times we come to know each other, and indeed there must also be mixed emotions among all the Families, which are tens of thousands, who have lost children, or spouses, or siblings, and more recently, in the times of criminal and terrorist conflict that Comandante Daniel, our President, has just narrated? How very difficult!<br />
<br />
I was talking to Commissioner General Diaz, saying to him: How hard for the Mothers of the Policemen who saw in the Social Media or even live on TV, how they were massacred and burned alive. How could that Mother, or those Mothers, with their broken hearts, afflicted, give those sons to the Nation and say, on behalf of their Families: Here we are! We are Nicaraguans and we are Policemen, or we are Members of the Army, in the case of the Members of the Nicaraguan Army, and we have given everything for Love, serving our People, and ready to give our lives for Love and Honor.<br />
<br />
I admire, respect and recognize that Love on the part of those Mothers, that Love on the part of Families, who have never hesitated to recognize, with pride, the Value of their children's belonging to Security Forces, to Brothers and Sisters who defend Sovereignty and Peace every day, and we are very proud of that.<br />
<br />
I always say that our Institutions are solid Institutions because they are forged in the Love for the Nation, they emerged from a Revolution that ended a criminal Dictatorship, that installed Democracy in Nicaragua, and may those who dare to dishonor the Nation and the Nicaraguan Families never forget it.<br />
<br />
The Revolution, on July 19th with its Triumph, a Popular Revolution, the Revolution that brought Democracy. How many Nicaraguans gave their lives for that Triumph? How many Nicaraguans, how many Families...! That explains our Courage, our Bravery, our Dignified, Sovereign, Hopeful Resistance, our Capacity to fight in all circumstances, and our Triumphs, Triumphs that are generated from that Noble, Combative, Blessed Character, of the best sons and daughters of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
It is true, we have suffered a lot, not only in April, but also before, and they are the same actors and authors, because there is a vile history, of surrender, of a few servile quislings to Imperialism. There is a history of submitting, kneeling, surrendering and seeking to be rewarded with wealth, as Comandante Daniel says, pennies at the end of the day, for which they would have sold out the Nation. And before, when they had the chance to change Nicaragua for the better and ensure the welfare of the country's families to which we are all entitled, they stole everything, as everyone knows very well.<br />
<br />
I keep thinking about Justice, which may take its time, but is done in the end, because there are factories of lies, every day manufacturing lies. How can one have the soul to fabricate lies, to frighten, to sow terror, mistrust, among the families of a small country, of a good people like Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
There are factories of lies and there are factories of crimes, and all with the same purpose, to serve the Yankees, to appear, ostentatiously, and ridiculously, like the children of William Walker, wanting to serve up the heads of Nicaraguans on a platter. No! We are not here to be served up on a platter to the Yankees. We are here to serve our People. We are here to honor the Nation. We are here to honor the commitments that, when they had their chance, the wealthy, the neoliberals, never lived up to, but instead deceived, swindled and stole from the country's Families.<br />
<br />
We are here to serve the Common Good, so that our Families everywhere have Employment, Tranquility, Security and Peace. And Tranquility, Security, Sovereignty well defended and Peace, are the guarantee of the Future.<br />
<br />
Here there is Education, and it takes us forward... Here there is Health Care, moving us Forward, enabling Health Care as an Essential Right, Health that is Life, that is Joy.<br />
<br />
Here We Advance, promoting Production that creates so much Employment, generating improvement in all our Lives. And we are going ahead with Highways, Roads, Bridges, Houses, Streets.... The whole world is watching ! This is how we serve. And every day we commit our hearts to make things even better, because our Commitment is not for today.... It's for Life ! A Revolutionary, Christian, Evolutionary Commitment, of Love for our Neighbor and of recognizing the Right of our Neighbor.<br />
<br />
We all have the Right to Live Well, and we all have the Right to the Future of Prosperity to which we aspire... Dreams and more Dreams that we are building, working, studying, taking care of ourselves, taking care of our Health, prospering. Dreams made into realities !<br />
<br />
That is why, to Nicaragua's Mothers, to Nicaragua's Families, I say to you: All of us Together, Let's Move Onward, in this Nation that we have recovered, because here Peace reigns... It was a diabolical interruption, of a few weeks, in which they wanted to take everything from us, to steal again, to settle there again, with unheard of "blessings" that are truly perverse... Blessings from People whose beatific credentials, and Holiness is entirely dubious, or whose mediation for the Spiritual Powers, in front of Christ and Jesus, is completely questionable.<br />
<br />
How can someone be a Pastor if they give crimes their blessing? How can anyone be a Pastor if they bless and approve the death of people at roadblocks, or that people continue having everything they have stolen from them; that women who are going to give birth are not allowed to pass in ambulances...? Pastors...? For goodness sake!<br />
<br />
That is why I always say, that the result of the involvement of those who call themselves "Pastors", in 2018 and in all the terrorist crimes of 2018, has been the loss of Faith and credibility among many Nicaraguans, who do not lose our connection with God Our Lord, from all our learning and our practices in Family; but we do lose confidence in an Institution that did not defend us, as children of God, all of us, and instead defended crimes against humanity. That is the truth. That is why Comandante Daniel says, and I say, with all reason, and with much pain we call them: Sons of the Devil!<br />
<br />
Here we were looking for Peace...! How we were looking for those very people out in the Municipalities that could help to stop the killing, burning, stealing, but they, the so-called Pastors were covering up, and applauding the crimes, the looting, the robberies, and the burning of Public Service Institutions. It was all so difficult...!<br />
<br />
We, as Christians, because we learned to live the Love of Christ, know that those moments left an indelible mark; they marked us and generated a New History in which the majority of Nicaraguans disbelieve in those individuals, not Christ, not God, not the Holy Spirit; but in those individuals who claimed to represent Spiritual Values and who instead disappointed us all. They tried to deceive us all, but we were not deceived.<br />
<br />
I remember the meetings in which none of them, not one of them, opened our mouths to say: We must protect Life. I remember rather what Commander Daniel called at the time the "ultimatum", that is, we were told to hand over the Institutions and the Government to the criminals. That is what they asked of us... and of course they lost their bet on crime, and they lost their bet on a government of the very same people who abused power to assault our People, to kill, to rob the People.<br />
<br />
When I talk about these things, I am truly moved, I am moved because, as a Believer and as a Devout person, those were very hard days, when one could confirm and verify so much hypocrisy, so much falsehood and so much perverse human condition, among those who called themselves Pastors, and when I say Pastors I mean People who offer to impart their blessings in the different rites.... There are Pastors who also contributed to Peace, who by their presence, were trying to see how those Roadblocks of Death could be cleared; but that is another Story.<br />
<br />
We are talking here, since Comandante Daniel has reminded us, about how it was not only terrible to see the dead, it was not only dreadful, terribly painful, to see the dead, to talk to their mothers, to see the burning, to see people burned alive; but to see a Priest who said in Masaya, while a Compañero was burning in front of the conveniently located sports pitch, "throw him down the latrine!". That was horrible for us. And that Priest is still there, they haven't moved him elsewhere! A criminal saying Mass, full of sins, how can he still be there, how can that possibly be understood?<br />
<br />
And the other priest, who rang the church bells so that people would go out to meet their death, a man who is now in Miami. And yet another one, who meets with that priest in Miami, every time he goes there, who was priest at a church in Masaya, in fact one he desecrated long ago.<br />
<br />
All this amidst a campaign of defamation, of slander, despite the Religious freedom here in Nicaragua. Because we are, from the bottom of our hearts, faithful and devoted to Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
It is true that we have lived through hard times and those hard times have taught us a lot. We, as Neruda said, those of that time, we are no longer the same, we have learned to take care of Peace, because we must guard and defend Peace, because that is what is asked of us, demanded of us. It is Responsibility of the Nicaraguan State: To take care for and defend Peace. The families, the mothers are asking us, they are asking us.<br />
<br />
We have recovered Peace, since it has been established that all those people who directed, financed and contributed to so much pain, so much suffering, must after all be looked into, investigated, and then it will be seen, how all these people who directed, financed and contributed to so much pain, so much suffering. Since then, Peace has flourished everywhere, people live in peace. We had already recovered it, but now there is a feeling of Pride, of Gratitude to God, because we are confirming, every day, that Peace is getting stronger.<br />
<br />
We Nicaraguans are brothers and sisters, but there are those who by their behavior, by their attitude, by demanding actions against their own people and their own country, cease to be Nicaraguans. Don't try telling me that these are vindictive personal actions That is not the case! What is indeed the case is that bad sons and daughters of Nicaragua call for punishments of Nicaragua it does not deserve, all because the country's People have not allowed them to return to loot, steal and plunder Nicaragua's State Assets and the Patrimony of the Nicaraguan people.<br />
<br />
They even declare... That only they are capable, that only they can get things done. Because they too are children of the devil... They are the ones who submit to the Empire, it is they who are being looked into, investigated, the individuals who grovel to the Empire hoping for rewards. Everything for themselves, and for the People, nothing. This is how they kept us for 16 years during which they did nothing, stole everything, while the People sank once more into illiteracy.<br />
<br />
Comandante Daniel talked about the Census, given the thousands of deaths caused by the lack of Health Care, and those marches of the starving Peasants, demanding government attention to be able to cultivate, sow, and eat, and not even to take to the market, it was not just for that. It was Food Security they demanded!<br />
<br />
Can we forget all that? No ! We who are aware of what we have lived through, of the suffering of the Majority, of the pain of the Mothers, we need to remind those who somehow think that we do not know our People's pain. We know the Pain the People endured and it is that Pain we strive to overcome, because we truly want a Nation free of suffering, of grief, a Nation where Love of our Neighbor, Christian Love, reigns.<br />
<br />
So, Compañer@s, we are living Historic Times, different, New Times. We press Forward, All Together, working with Hope, with Confidence in God, with Faith. That is what mobilizes this People that is People of God. And Let's continue to move Onward, since the Future is ours, of all Nicaraguans of Good Will. Thank you, Compañer@s.<br />
