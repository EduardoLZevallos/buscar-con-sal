<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Beloved Ambassador, Comrade Chen Xi, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China. When I greeted him, after the message he gave us Nicaraguans, when he spoke knowledgeably and with mastery of our reality, just now as we parted, he remarked to me, my only problem is that I can't speak Spanish very well. No, I told him, in fact you speak it much better than many of us. He really does speak Spanish very well.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And we say to our Compañero Ambassador, to all the Staff of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China, to the compañeros who are also involved in this Transport work; to Compañero Santi Zhou Qing, who is the representative of the Yutong Company, we say thank you for the discipline you show in your work, for the selflessness with which you work.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">After all, if we want to cultivate the land and then have food, we have to work hard, we have to combat pests, we have to be prepared to be able to save our crops; if the rains come, if we have flooding, we have to make extraordinary efforts to deliver water when there is drought, or the high temperatures that have been affecting a good part of the planet.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">That is to say, if we want results, if we want Well-being, if we want a Nation at Peace, if we want Health, if we want Housing, if we want Roads, if we want Education, that all has costs. It is true, there are budgets, but a budget means nothing if those who are going to execute the budget do not do so with Fortitude, with Courage, with the Spirit of Victory, despite the rain, despite the mud, despite the pains and difficulties.</span><br />
 </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Today, May 24th 2024, and here we are with our Brother Germán Pomares Ordóñez. Germán Pomares Ordóñez was born among our People, there in El Viejo, he worked in the fields, being a boy, from a poor, humble family, and when he encountered the Sandinista Front, he decided this is the way to escape from poverty, from misery, to overcome ignorance, and immediately he joined the Front, became one of the Founders of the Front, and becoming, we might well say, the most outstanding and heroic combatant Nicaragua has had, that the Sandinista National Liberation Front has had. Hero of a thousand Battles, survivor of a thousand battles!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And as Victory was approaching, on May 24</span><sup><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">th</span></sup><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">, June, and the Triumph of July 19th, at the gates of Victory, he had a mission, because we were already calling then for Insurrection, he had the mission of taking over the Jinotega Barracks with the Sandinista units. And he went there, with all the impetus, with all the courage, under conditions in which the Army the Yankees supported here was much larger than the Sandinista Front.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">They had more and better weapons than the Sandinista Front, they had long-range cannon; they had aviation, aviation that had been given to Somoza by the rulers of Israel, because the rulers of Israel have always been characterized as being on the side of the Imperialists, on the side of Dictators, of Tyrannies. And they had also delivered some Dabur launches to Somoza's Army, which we later found there on the Caribbean Coast after the Triumph.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And as another means that the Yankees used to arm Somoza, apart from what they gave Somoza in armaments, in equipment, they also used other countries subordinate to them, such as the rulers of Israel and Taiwan. Taiwan gave armaments to Somoza's Army, and sent specialists too in order to train in the knowledge of that armament, the handling of the armament.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And on a day like today, in an attack against the Jinotega Barracks, Germán Pomares Ordóñez was in the lead, and really he has to be recognized as a Compañero with courage, with fortitude, who threw himself on the thorniest thickets, for which we called him “El Danto”; because we all know what the dantos are like. And “El Danto" stuck, he was “The Danto”, and he was proud of that of course.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And there in the fight that he was leading he was wounded. The compañeros who were there accompanying him in the battle managed to rescue him and take him still alive to the Loma de la Cruz, in Jinotega, behind it lies that height; that is to say, here’s Jinotega and then comes that height, the forested height.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">They took him there to see if they could take care of him, to see if he could be saved, and there on a day like today he gave up his life for Nicaragua, for the impoverished, for the Peasants, for the Workers, for Peace.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Germán Pomares Ordóñez “El Danto", Brother, here are your fruits, here are your fruits!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Everything that is happening in Nicaragua today for the Well-being of the People, for the Betterment of the People, are the fruits of Germán Pomares Ordóñez and the Heroes like him, who gave their Life and gave their Blood, and also the Heroes who did not fall in combat but fought firmly. And that is why this Victory is the Victory of the People, that is why it was called Insurrection, because it was the People who rose up to free themselves, to break their chains.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">To the Brothers and Sisters of El Viejo, to the People of El Viejo, to everyone, to the Family of Germán, our Embrace full of Love and full of Combativeness. So as to tell Germán Pomares Ordóñez that he is present and will continue to be present in all the struggles that we are waging, in all the areas where we are in combat.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The struggle being waged in even the most remote areas of Nicaragua, for example by artisanal fishermen, now with more resources, with more capabilities, is a struggle for Life, a struggle for Peace.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The struggle being waged by the Communities that live along the Wangki River, the Coco River, Communities that have been there for centuries. They are Communities of our Original Peoples, and the fruits of the Revolution are reaching them now: Schools, Housing, Training to work with Livestock, Agriculture.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And I would say that a decisive strategic element for the Northern Caribbean Coast to be able to work more Joyfully, with more Fortitude, with greater Strength, with greater Security today is that it has finally been possible to break the isolation of the Caribbean from the Pacific.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The first road connecting the Caribbean with the Pacific is the one now built with concrete, with cement, because there the rains quickly destroy tarmacadam, and it is the one that has connected for the first time in history the Peoples of the Pacific, to Managua, from where you can get by land, over a modern road you can get by land, without a pinch of dust, you can get to Bluefields and from there to the communities around.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And the other road, which seemed impossible a few years ago, impossible to make that connection, is the one that has also been built in concrete, reaching and connecting Managua with Bilwi, and now connecting also with the Communities.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">All the communities in the Caribbean today have that encouragement, they have strengthened Heart, because the fact that those roads have arrived means they are no longer isolated and is the result of the combative peoples of the Caribbean, of the Northern Caribbean, of the Southern Caribbean, united with the combative people of the Central Region and of the Pacific Region. It is the unity of all Nicaraguans that allows us to achieve these Victories.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The Hospital that is now about to be completed in Bilwi, a modern hospital. We knew that the hospitals in Bilwi were pitiful. But now, a hospital as modern and well equipped as the best hospital in Nicaragua is being built, is being completed in Bilwi. Modern hospitals are being built everywhere. But who is decisive in all this? It is important to be clear about this, the Government, the Ministers, it is true, but more important than the Government and the Ministers is the People, they have defended Peace and will know how to defend Peace so that Nicaragua continues to improve.</span></p>

And in these times when, in the name of democracy, war is multiplying, aggression is multiplying, on the part of the Imperialists of the Earth, yes, the Imperialists of the Earth, and I never tire of repeating it, those who started making wars among themselves to dispute the domination of Europe when the United States did not yet exist, before the United States Government existed, they were killing each other.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">One of those notorious wars was the war Napoleon Bonaparte launched, when he thought, just like Hitler, that by defeating Russia he would make himself master of Europe, and who went into Russia but did not achieve Victory, what he achieved was defeat. And Russia saved the Europeans from domination by the French, by Napoleon, who already felt he was the King of Europe, and from there to take over all the Colonies, to go and colonize the rest of the world. That is what these gentlemen who present themselves to us as “great Democrats”, as the “great pacifists” were arguing over.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And then they started competing over how to take over the African Continent, which they took over at the point of blood and fire. And the European democrats set up a big business enslaving the population, Human Beings from the African Villages, chaining them up, putting them in points of sale, which were horrible fortified prisons where they kept them there in chains. </span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">We had the opportunity to visit one of those horrible castles, in Senegal, where they chained them up there; men and women enchained, children, old people, all enchained. It was a point when the economy of the time needed to buy slaves, and so there they came then from the European Nations, to buy slaves, selling Human Beings. And those who call themselves human rights defenders have committed the greatest crimes against humanity.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And so the inhabitants of Africa came, not as immigrants, but as slaves brought to the market. And who was buying them? They were bought by European countries that already had Colonies in Latin America and the Caribbean, and where they had already settled in the United States, the North American Empire began to settle and grow, which was nothing more than Europe transferred to the United States.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And there also buying slaves, and especially in the Southern part of the United States, where there were cotton plantations and they needed slave labor. And the slaveholder had such rights over the slave, that the slave was obliged to do as the slaveholder ordered, and if the slaveholder considered that one was not obeying him, then came simply lashes and even death.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Then, from Washington we were invited to a Meeting with President Carter, and we went to the Meeting. And at the Meeting, what did we hear from the Ministers who accompanied President Carter there? Already giving us the orders of how we should behave, with whom we should not have relations.</p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And the Army didn't have anything here, it had been totally left with very few weapons, which had been taken from the National Guard, and the rifles that we brought with us as the Frente, but it was an Army really in precarious conditions. Then I said to President Carter: And why don't you help us with weapons, to arm our army? No, no, no, he said, not that, that won't do, that's not allowed. That was the answer. It was a response that we had already expected, it was a way of trying them out; after all, if you are trying give us orders for everything, then give us the weapons for an Army. Oh no, under no circumstances.</span></p>

And they don't want to recognize the Palestinian state.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And I cannot fail to mention because to forget is death for Peoples, if peoples forget then they are victims. The campaigns no current, that there have to be negotiations, that matters have to be negotiated, that things have to be negotiated. But what a better example do we have than here in Nicaragua of what a negotiation with the Yankees means.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Our General Sandino, when he defeated them, because they couldn't defeat Sandino, and since they couldn't defeat Sandino and didn't want to keep suffering fatalities they preferred to withdraw, so they changed strategy and put Sacasa as President, and Somoza as Chief of the Army, an Army led by Yankee Army officers, not an Army led by Somoza with Nicaraguan soldiers. No, it was dominated by the Yankee army, armed by the Yankee army, trained by the Yankee Army, with a detachment here from the Yankee Army, a base, Nicaragua was a Yankee Army base.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So Sandino was in those very difficult conditions, because with whom was he going to fight with the main enemy now disappeared from sight, and as he said himself: Now it's our turn to fight an enemy that the people are neither seeing, nor feeling; and this is more dangerous, he said. And that was when he agreed to negotiate.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">He agreed to negotiate, and the other Generals told him: Don't negotiate, General, they're going to kill us, they're going to kill you and they're going to come and kill us. Because the detachments of the Army in Defense of National Sovereignty were still in the Segovias. But Sandino said he preferred to take the risk, and he came to Managua; he was up in the mountains but he came to Managua.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The first meeting took place, and to make Sandino believe that everything was already all right, Somoza came, approached Sandino, greeted him and embraced him, and they took a picture like two brothers. Somoza and Sandino, the criminal Somoza taking the photo with Sandino to make him believe that everything is over and that there is no problem with Peace. That surely must have also had an impact on Sandino's mood in terms of believing that in reality Peace had already arrived, and they had already signed it.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Then President Sacasa invites him to the Presidential House for a dinner, and they go to the Presidential House, Sandino with two more of his Generals, and there is President Sacasa who was a civilian, someone who was used, someone with no idea of what was going to happen, they used him, when they told him to invite Sandino, as a gesture of Peace. And so he invited Sandino to dinner, Sandino came to the Presidency; Sacasa invited his daughter to dinner, as a gesture as well. I mean, look at how many gestures they made enough to fool anyone.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Then they had dinner, talked quietly and there was no problem, there at the Presidential House; then they say goodbye late at night, and Sandino then left in his vehicle with his Compañeros, he comes down on Sandino Avenue, which used to be known as Roosevelt Avenue, it was Somoza's servility to put the name Roosevelt; so then they were coming down and when they come by the Campo de Marte, where the Army installations are now, there was a detachment of the genocidal Somoza Guard...</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">And when they were arrested, Sandino was surprised: What is this? Since we are coming from there, let me contact President Sacasa. At that moment, Sacasa's daughter came down from the Presidency and on finding that Sandino was being detained she comes up and demands of them: Why are you stopping the General if he’s coming from having dinner with us, with my father? Well, they took Sandino and the Compañeros and led them to a place, which is said to have been where the “Ajax Delgado” is today, a place where they put them against some stones and shot them.</span></p>

Who here in Nicaragua believes that by negotiating with the Yankees we will achieve Peace?
