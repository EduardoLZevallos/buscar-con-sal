<h3><br />
<strong>Ours are the True Victories!<br />
<br />
National Day of Peace</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>A reflection by Compañera Rosario Murillo</strong></h3>

<p><br />
Today, April 19th, we are going to refresh our memory a little, and especially the memory of the terrorists, if they have one at all... The memory of their failures as yet unburied criminals of history... As if Utter Dross could even have a Memory. We are going to refresh your minds, if you have one, about the damage you did to the Nicaraguan People, our People, our Nicaragua, which had been advancing via an effective Model of Alliances, addressing and confronting Poverty, banishing it, along Paths of Unity, Protagonism, Democracy, in order to continue prioritizing the Right to the Well-Being of all our People.</p>

<p>We are going to remind you of your greed, your evil, the evil that guided you, wanting to serve on a platter of silver or rather tin, to your loud mouthed bosses, wanting to serve them as a trophy, the Dignity of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>And we are going to remind ourselves of that phrase we made our own and that make our own every day "Neither Forgiveness, Nor Forgetting... But No Repetition”! Because God cannot forgive how they interrupted the progress of a Project of Christian, Socialist and Solidarity based Brother and Sisterhood. A Project that brings together everyone in Nicaragua, to progress, to prosper, in Justice. A Project that the Spiritual Strength of our People has now taken up again.</p>

<p>We are going to be tough, direct and frank, as always. We are going to deliver once more the historical invoices to Somocismo, old, out of date, decrepit data, all that ignominious culture of servility, surrender and submission which we thought we had, if not eradicated, at least isolated in the mentality and consciousness of the rich, and the most retrograde sectors, the Entities, Institutions and People of bygone political fakery.</p>

<p>With bitterness and disbelief, our people watched so many phonies rending their garments, grotesque idiots who showed their true face made up of the leftovers, the sinful and pestilent remains of Somocismo.</p>

<p>Let's show them as they are, carnival grotesques. Because only the satanic hatred of such grotesques, could seek the destruction of Hospitals, Health Centers, Schools, Universities, Technical, Technological Centers, Pure Progress; of Ambulances, Hospitals, Health Centers, Transport Units, Municipal Offices, Government Delegate Offices, and the aberrant and beyond criminal attempt of burning down the National Medicine Supply Center, located in Managua’s Sixth District, where they intended to destroy all the medicine in storage necessary for the Health Coverage of our People.</p>

<p>Criminals!</p>

<p>God can never forgive them!</p>

<p>Neither Forgiveness, Nor Forgetting... But No Repetition!</p>

<p>Nothing justifies, nor can justify the burning of media... There they are, self-styled “Democrats" burning down radio stations! Ah, what great Democrats! Setting fire to the Units of the National System for the Prevention, Mitigation, Protection and Attention of Disasters (SINAPRED); setting fire to the Citizen Security Units protecting our People in so many places.</p>

<p>Nothing justifies the state of siege against those who wanted and needed, for various reasons, to exercise their right to freedom of movement, to move from one place to another, to work, or to get health care, or to study, or to trade. The Barricades of Death... What Human Wretchedness! Nothing justifies all the crime, every rape, every torture, every evil desire to destroy the Advances in the Economic and Social Development of this Christian and Solidarity-oriented People.</p>

<p>Nothing can justify hatred. Nothing justifies the causing grief. Nothing justifies terror, here or anywhere in the world. Nothing justifies the fire that the heirs of William Walker used, seeking to destroy Granada again, when he left the infamous sign: "Granada used to be here". Nothing can justify the destruction of the Cultural and Natural Heritage of Peoples.</p>

<p>Nothing justifies the theft, the looting, the destruction of Schools and Equipment that our Government Ministries and local Municipalities used to deal with the serious problems that these self-same devils had bequeathed to us.</p>

<p>Nothing justifies the horror. Nothing justifies the vileness, the cruelty, the brutality against our People, against Nicaragua’s Families... The cruelty that they disguised as Democracy, blessed also by their false Priests, and by World’s grandiose “democrats" who defend Human Rights that they do not comply with, but which they violate everywhere instead. Those who are the main agents of genocide, enemies of the Protagonism of the World’s Peoples, of Democracy, Justice and Peace in the World.</p>

<p>Nothing justifies the heartbreak. Nothing justifies cowardice, lack of integrity, mendacity, fakery, deceit and falsehood. Nothing can justify the devastation of a country!</p>

<p>Nothing can justify the extreme cruelty they unleashed with their cosmetic faces, as if they were “good little children”, when in fact they were the most abject, historic enemies of the People, some with well-worn surnames, and others out of shameful and humiliating servitude.</p>

<p>Nothing justifies the decadent intention of all those posing as “cultivated”, "cultured”, or "illustrious", serving as sellout opportunists in the end, every time. Nothing justifies those who from below join up to their Master who flogs them and plunges them into the pit of abasement, into the humiliating pit of decomposition, uprooting them from their origins among the People or, as the would be God-like may think, from their “plebeian” origins.</p>

<p>Nothing justifies them. Nothing can justify them. They have no forgiveness from God, we repeat it, we say it. We all remember when they demanded, (and still demand) as people truly bereft of their nation, aggression after aggression that the frivolously call Sanctions, against our People. They demanded and put themselves at the forefront of dishonor, cratering and closing the Paths of Dignity, Culture, Coexistence and Just Development. They demanded and still demand. They did so and do so still because it motivated them and engendering in them a real obsession. Because they wanted it. Because they believed, and I think they still believe they would be paid very well. Because they believed themselves, considered themselves the reincarnation of the “son of a bitch, but our son of a bitch,” in the words of the US rulers about their pawn, Somoza. Words that fit them too like a glove.</p>

<p>Because above and beyond all that. Beyond the Evil. Beyond the indecent, unseemly and obscene demands of surrender, when here no one surrenders, and we all know it... Obscene proposals breaking with our Freedoms and Rights, with our Sovereignty. Their shameless attempt at imposition in flagrant violation of our Constitution and Laws. We saw all of that. Their brazen effort to imposing the outright violation of our Constitution and Laws, demanding to change, or overthrow, the Government. But it backfired on them!</p>

<p>Because Further On, Always Further On, Always active and combative, those who Neither Sell Out, Nor Surrender, those who want, like Zeledón, like Sandino, like Carlos, like Tomás, like Daniel, a Free Nation or Death, we are the Strength, the Spiritual Strengths of a Combative, Lucid, Loving, Generous People, Defender of Peace. And how good to say it today with Joy... Today, our National Day of Peace, we have Peace, because we have Love and Dignity!</p>

<p>Our Legacy. Our Heritage. Our Flags. Our Purifying Censers. Our Sacred Flames... All that Dignity, Decorum, Honor and National Pride that move us to transcend and Overcome.</p>

<p>We Keep Overcoming. And We Keep Striving. So Let's Go Onward!</p>

<p>And here we might read out the list of the bottomless incidents. The destruction of a country. These are the True Truths, wrapped up, in their narrative, in hoaxes, traps, falsehoods, deceptions, webs of entanglements in which they themselves were caught.</p>

<p>But the Real Truth remains. As it did remain. It pulsates between Real Victories. Because ours are True Victories... True Victories, because Work is our Dignified Laurel and Honor, our Triumphant Emblem.</p>

<p>Long live Free Nicaragua! Long live Free Nicaragua! Long live Free Nicaragua! 45 years ago we said it, we shouted it proudly, and the bedraggled Agents of Evil have no right to hijack our Virtuous, Courageous, Victorious Flag, which cost so much Blood to this our People of Glory, of Memory and Full Horizons.</p>

<p>Nothing for Evil</p>

<p>All for Good</p>

<p>Here we are well aware of the opprobrium they will always carry on their shoulders, since I doubt they have Souls. Theirs is the curse for all time, for traitors, cowards, for the sold-out, soulless Beings of Darkness. Theirs is the Macabre Narrative of their failure!</p>

<p>Neither Forgiveness, Nor Forgetting...!</p>

<p>We reiterate it...</p>

<p>No Repetition!</p>

<p>The Comandante stays on, we said.</p>

<p>And he has stayed and our Courage has stayed</p>

<p>And all of us stay here</p>

<p>in our Patriotic Nation and in Freedom!</p>

<p>Long live Peace!</p>

<p>Long live our National Day of Peace!</p>

<p>They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They</p>

<p>Ours Are the True Victories!</p>
