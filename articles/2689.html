<p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-9035684"><em><strong>NPR</strong> (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/08/1198475446/the-sunday-story-a-rare-look-inside-locked-down-nicaragua">9/10/23</a>) describes correspondent Eyder Peralta as “the first foreign journalist to make it into the country in more than a year,” which would come as a surprise to numerous independent foreign journalists.</em></p>
</div>

<p><strong>NPR began its report “A Rare Look Inside Locked-Down Nicaragua” (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/08/1198475446/the-sunday-story-a-rare-look-inside-locked-down-nicaragua">9/10/23</a>) with the demonstrably false claim that Nicaragua has “kept all foreign journalists out for more than a year.” This led into a harrowing story of how its reporter arrived in Nicaragua…and reported without incident.</strong></p>

<p>In 2023 alone, numerous foreign journalists from press outlets from all parts of the world have reported from Nicaragua. Broadcast outlets based in the <a href="https://youtu.be/C0s5czynkaU?si=BQCJPTqRBdSNu0lI">United States</a>, <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-12-16/China-Media-Group-inaugurates-bureau-in-Nicaragua-162cy4t4kco/index.html">China</a>, <a href="https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:135035-nicaragua-y-rt-en-espanol-firman-memorandum-de-entendimiento-para-lacooperacion">Russia</a>, <a href="https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2023/07/24/707662/Nicaragua">Iran</a> and around <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8o0lqs">Latin America</a> have regularly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogxaA8UAZpQ">filed reports</a> in both English and <a href="https://www.elperiodicodepanama.com/nicaragua-nacion-de-paz-y-desarrollo/">Spanish</a>. Independent reporters from the United States, Canada and Britain have reported in outlets such as the <a href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/putting-people-first"><b>Morning Star</b></a>, <a href="https://rabble.ca/general/the-nicaragua-pinata-2/"><b>Rabble</b></a> and <a href="https://www.blackagendareport.com/celebrating-revolution-nicaragua"><b>Black Agenda Report</b></a>.</p>

<p>Most of the international journalists who have reported from Nicaragua in recent years have not been openly biased against Nicaragua’s Sandinista government, which perhaps disqualifies them as reporters in <b>NPR</b>‘s eyes. But the <b>Associated Press</b>, whose main correspondent for Nicaragua, Gabriela Selser, calls its government “a perverse and cruel system that exceeds all limits” (<b>Pledge Times</b>, <a href="https://pledgetimes.com/gabriela-selser-the-desire-for-power-has-prevented-ortega-from-taking-over/">6/23/23</a>), has published at least two stories bylined Managua this year (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-spain-caribbean-rosario-murillo-dd6bc04899c00e58660f72d430d856ae">2/11/23</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nicaragua-pope-francis-vatican-suspend-2b715d849e44373999090768e518322e">3/12/23</a>), though most of Selser’s Nicaragua reporting seems to be done from Mexico City. (Selser, who previously held both Nicaraguan and Argentine passports, had her Nicaraguan passport revoked by Managua.)</p>

<p>Steve Sweeney, former international editor of<b> Morning Star</b>, was <a href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/nicaraguans-confident-ortega-victory-%E2%80%93-steve-sweeney-reports">prevented</a> from reporting on the Nicaraguan presidential election in 2021—not by Managua, but by the United States and Mexico. It’s not clear that his blocked travel was connected with his attempt to cover the election—Sweeney was not given an explanation for the denial of transit—but at the least his exclusion suggests that the US government has priorities higher than allowing journalists to travel freely to do their jobs.</p>

<p>Ayesha Rascoe, host of <b>NPR</b>’s <b>Sunday Story</b>, nevertheless said the Sandinista government of Nicaragua “has basically banned foreign journalists,” <a href="https://x.com/ayesharascoe/status/1700846800997847296?s=20">reiterating</a> this claim on social media. Throughout the 39-minute podcast, Rascoe and correspondent Eyder Peralta didn’t name the foreign journalists who had been barred from entering, despite their emphasis on the claim.</p>

<p>Covid-19 entry requirements came into effect with heightened travel regulations in 2021–22, and slowed travel for all purposes to Nicaragua. A <b>Washington Post </b>correspondent (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/es/el-washington-post-podcast/daniel-ortega-y-the-washington-post-cuba-y-la-protesta-del-15-alemania-y-la-pandemia/">11/5/21</a>) said she was unable to board her flight to Nicaragua from Mexico, after the airline informed her that she did not appear on the list provided by Nicaraguan authorities of passengers who had been approved for travel.</p>

<p>Similar experiences were reported by travelers who had inadequately followed the new pre-travel procedure. Nicaraguan health authorities strictly enforced the Covid-19 test requirement and even withheld approval, causing travelers to submit new tests with correct specifications and reschedule flights.</p>

<h3><b>Getting in</b></h3>

<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9035685" style="float: left; margin: 10px; width: 360px;"><img alt="NPR: I returned to Nicaragua, where I was born, and found a country steeped in fear " aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9035685" class="size-medium wp-image-9035685" decoding="async" height="422" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" src="https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Nicaragua-Fear-350x422.png" srcset="https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Nicaragua-Fear-350x422.png 350w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Nicaragua-Fear-600x723.png 600w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Nicaragua-Fear-768x926.png 768w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Nicaragua-Fear-640x771.png 640w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Nicaragua-Fear.png 775w" width="350" />
<p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-9035685"><em><strong>NPR</strong> (<a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/2023-09-14/i-returned-to-nicaragua-where-i-was-born-and-found-a-country-steeped-in-fear">9/14/23</a>) complains of a speech by President Daniel Ortega, “only a select group of people were invited to hear the president’s speech in person”—in apparent contrast to free countries, where all presidential addresses are always open to the public.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Peralta recounted his entry through a “remote” border crossing from Honduras, where he got through the immigration checkpoint within “maybe five minutes” and entered Nicaragua: “And that was it. I was in. I was about to walk into one of the most authoritarian countries in the world, and I didn’t get asked a single question.” To his surprise, he found that “everything points to normal…. People are out shopping. They’re going to work, to school. On the Saturday that I was there, the bars were packed!”</p>

<p>Peralta—who at one point described at length his own family’s souring on the Sandinista movement and consequent flight from the country in the 1980s—clearly came in with preconceived notions of what he would find. Barring his own paranoia and his references to the Soviet Union, nothing about his actual experiences offered evidence of authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Life in what <b>NPR</b> (<a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/2023-09-14/i-returned-to-nicaragua-where-i-was-born-and-found-a-country-steeped-in-fear">9/14/23</a>) dubbed “a country steeped in fear” is in fact quite similar to other countries of the region that I’ve visited. Young people crammed into arenas to see popular Latino musical artists <a href="https://www.el19digital.com/galerias/ver/titulo:2206-asi-se-vivio-el-concierto-de-christian-nodal-en-nicaragua">Christian Nodal</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/concierto-camilo-nicaragua-2023?lang=en">Camilo Echeverry</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ll_bAzL3XLs?si=30h5SWbUzlxHR_md">Olga Tañón</a> in recent months. Bars and nightclubs are popular destinations for students and young people on weekends around the country, as are neighborhood block parties.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <b>NPR</b> referred to the country as a “dictatorship” five times, “authoritarian” five times and, in the spirit of anti-Communism, linked it to the Soviet Union three times.</p>

<p>“Fear runs so deep that even the president and vice president don’t trust their countrymen enough to hold a real public rally,” Peralta reported. Peralta seemed to base this claim on the very basic security measures taken around the perimeter of a stadium on July 19 in preparation for the official act to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution. “Suddenly, a city that had seemed normal now has police officers on every corner,” Peralta dramatically related. He described “checkpoints” around the stadium and told listeners: “It becomes clear that only a select group of people are invited to hear the president’s speech.”</p>

<p>His dire portrayal of an event that he did not attend—but which I did—seemed to falsely suggest that only in an authoritarian country would an event with high-level officials and foreign government representatives have <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-hold-july-celebration-hoped-mark-independence-covid/story?id=78288030">guestlists</a> and other <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/451406-white-house-guests-to-get-vip-tickets-to-trumps-independence-day/">security measures</a> in place.</p>

<p>Contrary to the claim that President Daniel Ortega is unable to hold “real” public events, he presided over multiple public events in the past few weeks, including a police parade, a military parade and a Central American <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3u5KIJR9wSY?si=SsAolXUsbR41vxr_">Independence Day parade</a>, which were held in the center of Managua with the attendance of the public. The open events were <a href="https://twitter.com/canal6nicaragua/status/1697652136652268000?s=46&amp;t=ScSnn71ORdVOHm4BZjkS1Q">promoted</a> in advance by major outlets like <b>Canal 6</b>.</p>

<h3><b>The sources</b></h3>

<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9035686" style="float: right; margin: 10px; width: 360px;"><img alt="NPR depiction of Sandinista supporters" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9035686" class="size-medium wp-image-9035686" decoding="async" height="233" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" src="https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Ortega-Supporters-350x233.png" srcset="https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Ortega-Supporters-350x233.png 350w, https://fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NPR-Ortega-Supporters.png 600w" width="350" />
<p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-9035686"><em><strong>NPR</strong> (<a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/2023-09-14/i-returned-to-nicaragua-where-i-was-born-and-found-a-country-steeped-in-fear">9/14/23</a>) depicted “supporters…of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega” in a photograph—but did not seem to think it journalistically to speak with any of them.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Though the segment ran 39 minutes long, it didn’t manage to interview a single supporter of the Nicaraguan government. The report relied heavily on perspectives from the exterior, despite the emphasis <b>NPR</b> put on Peralta’s travel to Nicaragua. Peralta interviewed three sources in the United States: an anonymous State Department official; Carolina Jiménez Sandoval of the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA); and Félix Maradiaga, a former prisoner <a href="https://fair.org/home/nicaraguas-political-prisoners-would-be-criminals-by-us-standards/">now released</a> to the United States, who declared he “had always been anti-Sandinista and anti-socialist.”</p>

<p>Maradiaga was convicted of inciting foreign interference against Nicaragua’s sovereignty; he had <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-116hhrg36567/html/CHRG-116hhrg36567.htm">appeared</a> before a US congressional subcommittee in June to seek support for overthrowing the Nicaraguan government. His wife, Berta Valle, who is also Nicaraguan, was part of self-styled Venezuelan “president” Juan Guaidó’s <a href="https://www.laprensani.com/2021/12/13/politica/2923779-crisis-de-nicaragua-logro-ser-visibilizada-en-la-cumbre-por-la-democracia-a-traves-de-la-delegacion-de-juan-guaido">delegation</a> to Joe Biden’s “Summit for Democracy” in 2021.</p>

<p>A FAIR report (<a href="https://fair.org/home/wola-medias-left-source-for-pro-coup-propaganda-in-venezuela/">6/4/20</a>) called WOLA “the Western media’s go-to source for confirming the US elite’s regime change groupthink.” Jiménez Sandoval is WOLA’s president, and her <a href="https://www.wola.org/people/carolina-jimenez-sandoval/">bio</a> touts her record of  “addressing grave crimes under international law in Venezuela and Nicaragua.”</p>

<p>In Nicaragua, the only sources given airtime were located in Masaya, which saw a concentration of violence during the destabilizing protests of 2018. One was a woman Peralta described as “one of the organizers” of 2018 protests there; the other was a hospital employee who, among other things, talked about the lack of supplies at the hospital, and how he is “expected to stay quiet” about them. He also said that “the economic situation is tough.” Neither he nor Peralta offer the crucial context of US sanctions on Nicaragua that are precisely intended to worsen the economic situation.</p>

<p>Despite being in Masaya, Peralta’s report managed to omit the stories of victims whose lives were forever changed, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/AhmedKaballo/status/1480573388087300099">Reynaldo Urbina</a>, whom I <a href="https://twitter.com/KawsachunNews/status/1434315970475134976">interviewed</a>, among <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/bitacora/node/1821">many others</a>.</p>

<p>No pro-government sources were featured or even mentioned in the <b>NPR</b> segment, aside from two short soundbites of public speeches from President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo.</p>

<p>The piece aired two days after affluent opposition figure Gioconda Belli, who since 1990 has lived in the United States and, more recently, Spain, took to <b>NPR</b>’s airwaves on <a href="https://www.latinousa.org/2023/09/08/the_revolutions_of_gioconda_belli/"><b>Latino USA</b></a>. She and other opposition celebrities have been featured in <a href="https://elpais.com/america/2023-09-12/ortega-y-murillo-confiscan-la-casa-de-la-escritora-gioconda-belli-en-managua.html">spreads</a> in Western corporate media, which has platformed several former allies of the Sandinistas’ FSLN party; the party’s more than 2 million <a href="https://www.elciudadano.com/actualidad/jorge-sanarrucia-presidente-de-la-fundacion-los-carlitos-de-nicaragua-esta-revolucion-ha-venido-a-restituir-los-derechos-de-todos-y-cada-uno-de-los-nicaraguenses/11/18/">members</a> and leadership have not gotten similar exposure.</p>

<p>Belli broke with the FSLN in the 1980s, around the same time that she married <b>NPR</b>‘s Central America correspondent. A member of WOLA’s <a href="https://www.wola.org/honorary-council/">Honorary Council</a>, she has been interviewed numerous times on <b>NPR</b> since the early ’90s, and is frequently referred to as a leftist when she’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-61668667">criticizing</a> the governments of Cuba and Venezuela.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/348764934/eyder-peralta">15 years</a> with <b>NPR</b>, Peralta was based in Africa before specializing in Latin America. At the height of the corporate media’s interest in Venezuela, as the Trump administration was tightening sanctions and threatening military intervention, Peralta <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/17/695536858/chavismo-fades-as-venezuela-s-poor-suffer">sought interviews</a> with opponents of the government rather than supporters. Following <b>NPR</b>’s airing of his latest report, he sat down for an <a href="https://confidencial.digital/confidencialtv/eyder-peralta-periodista-de-npr-entra-a-nicaragua-y-esto-fue-lo-que-descubrio/">interview</a> with the Nicaraguan opposition outlet <b>Confidencial</b>, run by Carlos Chamorro, the son of Nicaragua’s neoliberal former President Violeta Chamorro.</p>

<p>Peralta had <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/16/1157489223/nicaragua-ortega-strips-citizenship">previously</a> framed arrests and convictions as a “crackdown” on “political opponents” and dissent, without reference to the charges brought against them based on the country’s laws. The reporting downplays the armed attacks carried out in 2018, and the crimes of money laundering and treason committed by individuals who received large sums of money from the National Endowment for Democracy and USAID. These entities <a href="https://fair.org/home/nicaragua-a-dictatorship-when-it-follows-us-lead-on-ngos/">poured money</a> into Nicaraguan NGOs after President Daniel Ortega was voted back into office in 2007, with the specific aim of training people to oppose his government and create the conditions for regime change (<b>FAIR.org</b>, <a href="https://fair.org/home/nicaragua-a-dictatorship-when-it-follows-us-lead-on-ngos/">6/16/22</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/16/1157489223/nicaragua-ortega-strips-citizenship">accusations</a> of a “political crisis” and “constant turmoil” echo claims made in an <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1t/k1tqw1rru6">update</a> from the UN high commissioner for Human Rights that was <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2023/09/nicaragua-continued-and-widespread-deterioration-human-rights">presented</a> before the UN Human Rights Council on September 12.</p>

<p>Professor Alfred de Zayas, a former UN independent expert on international order, objected to a similar <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/03/nicaragua-crimes-against-humanity-being-committed-against-civilians">UN report</a> on Nicaragua released in March, as the lead signer of a <a href="https://afgj.org/nicanotes-03-23-2023">statement</a> that called the report “fatally flawed.” De Zayas and other critics called the human rights report “biased” and an “abuse of the UN system,” saying it</p>

<p><em>"completely fails to address the enormous damage done to ordinary people, businesses, and public services by violent protesters in 2018, perpetuating a gross injustice against the human rights of thousands of Nicaraguans."</em></p>

<p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-9035688"><em>An account in <strong>MR Online</strong> (<a href="https://mronline.org/2023/07/15/the-attempted-coup-in-nicaragua-in-2018-why-support-for-it-collapsed/">7/15/23</a>) describes how violent opposition tactics eroded support for the opposition, as anti-government roadblocks “not only strangled the country’s transport system but became the scene of intimidation, robberies, rape, kidnappings and murder.”</em></p>
</div>

<p><b>NPR</b>‘s report omits two important issues in understanding Nicaragua today. First, <a href="https://mronline.org/2023/07/15/the-attempted-coup-in-nicaragua-in-2018-why-support-for-it-collapsed/">violent protests</a> in 2018, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200708094142/https:/radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/general/286068/asi-financia-eeuu-a-los-terroristas/">funded</a> by the US in an effort to overthrow the government, killed a large number of innocent civilians and <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Nicaragua-Honors-Police-Killed-During-US-backed-Protests--20190613-0007.html">police</a>. The majority of the arrests and charges that were widely reported by corporate press during and following 2018 were either directly related to acts of violence carried out during the months of terror, or to  subsequent <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/comision_verdad_justicia_paz_5-2-2019.pdf">investigations</a> that revealed the <a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2021/06/the-cia-attempting-coups-in-nicaragua-with-tax-dollars-through-us-agencies-and-corporate-foundations/">foreign financing</a> of the anti-government riots. As is standard in US establishment media, <b>NPR</b> showed no interest in the <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/nicaragua_2018_uncensoring_the_truth.pdf">victims</a> of the violent coup efforts, only in the plight of the people who were punished for allegedly instigating them.</p>

<p>Second, as mentioned above, coercive sanctions have been rolled out by the US, Canada and the EU in recent years. The latest US <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/english-spanish-rubio-kaine-introduce-groundbreaking-legislation-to-confront-nicaraguan-crisis/">sanctions bill</a> currently before Congress would extend the US government’s ability to impose economic punishment until 2028. Such sanctions were the subject of protest in the <a href="https://cubaminrex.cu/en/declaration-summit-heads-state-and-government-group-77-and-china-current-development-challenges">Havana Declaration</a> of the G77 + China Summit, for their “devastating impacts on the realization of human rights, including the right to development and the right to food.”</p>

<p>At the end of Peralta’s report, back in the studio, he told host Ayesha Rascoe that the government has “closed the Jesuit University in Managua,” without mentioning that it was being reopened as a <a href="https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:143669-universidad-nacional-casimiro-sotelo-garantizara-educacion-gratuita-para-el-pueblo">public</a> and <a href="https://www.vivanicaragua.com.ni/2023/08/18/sociales/casimiro-sotelo-gratuita-pueblo/">tuition-free</a> institution. Classes are set to commence soon at the recently nationalized Casimiro Sotelo University, in a country whose hallmark policy since the Sandinistas returned to office in 2007 has been expansion of access to and improvement of <a href="https://afgj.org/nicanotes-01-26-2022">public education</a> at all levels.</p>
