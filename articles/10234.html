Today we are commemorating the 41st anniversary of foundation of our National Police!</p>

<p>It is an honor for us Police Men and Women, to celebrate 41 years of institutional life, <strong>WORKING FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND STABILITY OF OUR NATION, CLOTHED BY OUR MOTTO OF HONOR, SAFETY AND SERVICE.</strong></p>

<p>On September 5 we celebrate another anniversary, paying tribute to the legacy of the Student Hero Ajax Delgado López, assassinated by the Somoza’s Guard in La Aviación prison on September 5, 1960.</p>

<p>Our National Police was founded since the triumph of the Sandinista Popular Revolution on July 19, 1979, as the "Sandinista Police" in tribute to the legacy of our General of Free women and men, Augusto César Sandino, which is why we feel proud. A legacy kept alive in the heart of each one of us, a Police formed with Sandinista and revolutionary principles and values, to protect families alongside our People, in compliance with our constitutional mission, which is to prevent and investigate crimes, criminal offenses, traffic accidents, chase and catch criminals.</p>

<p>At 41 years, our National Police, in coordination with institutions of our government and the community, with the leadership of You, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Comrade Rosario Murillo Zambrana, we continue to develop Policies, Programs and Strategies for Citizen’s Security, which constitute a priority of our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, such as:<br />
 <br />
<strong>Comprehensive care model for female comrades (Women for Life, Women for Peace and Good)</strong>: Attention to victims of domestic and sexual violence, prevention and investigation of crimes that threaten the dignity of female comrades and Human Trafficking.</p>

<p><strong>Model for the Attention of our Youth (Inter-institutional Program for the Attention and Comprehensive Development of Adolescents and Youth for a culture of peace:</strong></p>

<p>Prevention of youth violence within the family, neighborhoods, schools, through social inclusion.<br />
 <br />
<strong>"My life without drugs, peace and future" and "Neighborhood free from addictions"</strong>: Articulation of institutions of our Government and families to prevent drug use: through the Ministries of Education, Family, Health, Youth, Institute for Sports, Culture and municipal governments.</p>

<p><strong>Containment Wall against Organized Crime and International Drug Trafficking</strong>, Drug seizure in the national territory and dismantling of cells. Not allowing a social or logistical base for organized crime.</p>

<p>Faced with the COVID-19 Pandemic, the National Police continues to comply with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health with police personnel, prisoners in preventive cells, and people who visit our police units. Likewise, we guarantee the accompaniment of hundreds of doctors and thousands of health brigade members who have mobilized to save lives in Counties, neighborhoods and settlements throughout the country (more than 6 million visits).</p>

<p>Our "Carlos Roberto Huembes" Hospital and the health care units in the country have provided additional resources and medical personnel for the comprehensive care of COVID-19 patients.</p>

<p>With SINAPRED we have participated in all multi-threat exercises and training for the attention and mitigation of natural disasters.</p>

<p>In this year 2020, our country continues to be a reference in Latin America for its excellent security levels:</p>

<p>1. Nicaragua maintains the lowest average homicide rate in Central America; 8 for every 100,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>2. We do not have gangs.</p>

<p>3. There are no clandestine drug cartels, cells, bases and landing strips.<br />
 <br />
4. In this year 2020 there have been no crimes of kidnapping or hitmen in our country.</p>

<p>5. With the retaining wall strategy, we have contributed to regional security, preventing drugs from reaching the northern countries and violence to the southern countries.</p>

<p>During this year 2020, our National Police reaffirms its commitment to citizen’s security, obtaining the following achievements:<br />
 <br />
- In the development of the Campaign <strong>"Women for Life, Women for Peace and Good"</strong>, the relaunching of 31 Women's Police Stations has been carried out in Municipalities of the country, departmental capitals and Districts of Managua, in addition, 15 Police Stations will be relaunched during the period September-December 2020, strengthening the investigation of crimes and criminal offenses that threaten the life and dignity of Women.</p>

<p>- With the implementation of the Program <strong>"Improvement and Expansion of Police Coverage to Strengthen Citizen’s Security"</strong>, in 2020, <strong>38</strong> new police units have been built and inaugurated in the country (<strong>2</strong> departmental units, <strong>30</strong> municipal units, <strong>6</strong> Centers for Attention and Police Services for citizens). Also, <strong>16</strong> police units are being built, scheduled to be inaugurated during the period September-December 2020, and <strong>12</strong> new units will be built during the year 2021.</p>

In such a way, procedures can be carried out automatically, including: Certificates of Conduct, Police permits, resolution and certificate of traffic accidents, vehicle registration certificate, driver education seminar, license plates loss reports, and theoretical exams for new drivers in virtual classrooms.</p>

<p>- During 2019, we processed <strong>one million one hundred thousand online services</strong> (website), for this year 2020, we have projected to process 1.6 million services, a 45% increase. This means that 1.6 million Nicaraguan sisters and brothers carry out these procedures from their electronic devices. (Inside and outside of the country).<br />

<p>- The police effectiveness is 84%, for every 100 reported events, the Police clarified a total of 84 cases.</p>

 <br />
In 41 years of institutional life of our Police, 515 police brothers and sisters (493 men and 22 female colleagues) have given their lives in fulfillment of their constitutional service, guaranteeing citizen’s security. The contribution that our communities have made through the Voluntary Police is meritorious. In these 41 years, 42 volunteer police men and women have died in fulfillment of their service (41 men and 1 female comrade).<br />
 <br />
On this 41st Anniversary, we remember and pay tribute to all the heroes and heroines of peace and security who gave their lives for the benefit of our people, building a safer Nicaragua, protecting individuals, families and communities, prioritizing the most vulnerable.<br />
 <br />
We honor their memory by being loyal to their legacy, for honoring all of them, I request 1 minute of silence.<br />
 <br />
