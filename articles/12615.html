<p>MINISTRY<br />
OF<br />
FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br />
Managua, Nicaragua</p>

<p>NOTE FROM THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br />
OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA<br />
TO THE CHANCELLERY OF THE KINGDOM OF SPAIN</p>

<p>“The Truth Will Set You Free”</p>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity regrets and condemns the inadmissible interference of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain, in the matter of Internal Affairs that only correspond to our Country and our People.</p>

<p>We have denounced, and will continue to denounce, the cynical and continuous interference and intervention in our Internal Affairs, unbecoming of Democratic Governments, unbecoming also of Regimes that continually fail to comply with the Rights of their Peoples to Autonomy or to Autonomous Processes of Independence, which has already caused so much suffering to entire Families of Peoples who refuse to continue to be subjected to arbitrary monarchical dictates.</p>

<p>We remind the Government of Spain of its obligation to respect, as we have respected them, and to assume, without delay, a Path responding to the just claims of the inhabitants of the so-called Iberian Peninsula.</p>

<p>We remind the Government of Spain of serious issues still pending, dating back to the 1980's, when its then “Socialist” President, Mr. Felipe Gonzalez, created the so-called Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups (GAL) that forever stained Spain with responsibility for crimes against humanity, never investigated or tried, actions for which even the CIA has accused the “Socialist” Government of Spain, and which demand Justice.</p>

<p>We remind the Government of Spain of the clear evidence about the "connections" of the GAL with the underworld and with paramilitary groups such as the Anti-Communist Apostolic Alliance (AAA) and others. Almost 40 terrorist actions were carried out by the GAL, murdering and wounding over 60 people with impunity, while none of the successive Governments of the Kingdom bothered to respond to the victims, clarifying each one of those hate crimes and crimes against humanity which remain open to prosecution, according to the United Nations, that is to say, they are pending investigation and indictment by that self-styled “perfect democracy”.</p>

<p>We remind the Spanish Government that the Truth cannot be hidden, nor does it expire, in spite of the shameless way they try presenting themselves to the World as spotless, impeccable, clean, upright, and demanding of those they consider inferior, imperfect, mistaken and, still under their now non-existent and imaginary, thanks to Grace and Struggle, Colonial Empire.</p>

<p>The terrible terrorist plot of the GAL still lurks, concealing itself, among Spain's hypocritical and bloody Politics, in violation of Human Rights, which also bears responsibility for deaths still to be investigated in its prisons of Basque pro-independence political prisoners who, with no explanation, were found dead in Spanish prison cells.</p>

<p>All these hate crimes and crimes against humanity, which qualified as State Terrorism, show the immoral character of Spain's Institutions, which shamelessly dare to set crowns on their discredited heads, seeking to ignore the criminal indictment for historical manipulation of a State that persecutes, imprisons, tortures and kills, with no self-criticism, repentance, justice, or rectification.</p>

<p>To the Spanish State, which pridefully criticizes, accuses and demands what it does not do itself, History will never absolve them! The infamy cannot be hidden by bravado, dressing themselves up as judges, which they are not, nor can they be, nor has anyone called on them to be, because they have no moral authority, or respect, given so much falsehood, concealment, lies, crimes, hate crimes and crimes against humanity, which they do not admit to, but which everyone knows, and condemns !</p>

<p>Faced with so much hypocrisy and so much impudence, we reject each and every one of the words contained in the unspeakable, false and farcical calls of the Spanish Foreign Ministry.</p>

<p>We challenge and defy the Kingdom of Spain, to assume all its true responsibility for its ferocious, brutal Colonial and Neocolonial History, as well as its Fascism disguised as Socialism.</p>

<p>We challenge them to open the way, without repression, or persecution, or excessive violence, to the free decision and vote on the status that every Country of its, as of today, centralized State, call for, claim and demand.</p>

<p>We challenge them to allow free participation in Voting and Elections, without threats, intimidation, or imprisonment for the Independence Leaders, and without persecution beyond their borders, to those who have simply demanded respect for their Beliefs, Determinations and Rights.</p>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of the Sovereign Republic of Nicaragua, which ceased to be a Colony centuries ago, either of Spain or any other aggressive, destructive, slaving and plundering Power, reminds the Kingdom of Spain that we have the Right to live following our own Paths, and that we are not, nor will we ever be again, Territories dominated by the criminal greed of anyone.</p>

<p>Let us reflect: Before so much proof, before so much abundance of Truths, before this Spanish State that has never had the integrity to confess its faults, how is it possible that, these idiots really, dare to offer lessons of Democracy, when they are not one, nor do they give a good example, nor do they comply with the Truth and Justice ? "The Truth will set you Free", they say. Is that not so...?</p>

<p>Managua, August 10, 2021</p>

Government of Reconciliation<br />
and National Unity<br />
