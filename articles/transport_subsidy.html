2010</span><br>
      <br>
When Daniel Ortega came to power in January 2007, his government was
faced with the reality of a financially unsustainable public transport
system. While the Nicaraguan authorities do regulate public transport
fares, there was not, until recently, any attempt to protect
transport providers from the harsh reality of constant increases in the
cost of inputs (gasoline, spare parts, lubricants, etc.).&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
As a result of this complete lack of financial support from the
three previous governments, public transport providers </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(the vast majority of whom own one or two
vehicles and are organized in transport cooperatives) had been unable
to give their vehicles proper maintenance or replace faulty ones.
Consequently, by 2007, a large proportion of Nicaragua's public transport fleet
was obsolete.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In an attempt to turn
this situation around</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, the FSLN
government has been implementing a transport policy which aims both to
ensure accessibility of public transport by keeping fares low
and to create financial sustainability for transport providers. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This policy has been
based on two main components: the periodical provision of subsidized
fuel and </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">the</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> reduction of input prices. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reduced priced inputs and
vehicles for transport cooperatives</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
This second strategic line of action - reducing the price of transport
sector inputs - is made possible via tax free,
bulk importation of items like tyres, batteries, lubricants, electronic
passenger meters, and others which transport cooperatives are able to
access with low interest rate credits which they can pay back over two
years.<br>
      <br>
The government has also been able to significantly reduce the price of
new vehicles thanks
to the donation of 130 new buses from Russia in 2009. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">These
buses, worth US$60,000 each, are being made available to transport
cooperatives in Managua for US$25,000 in an attempt to gradually replace</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Managua's
obsolete public transport fleet. Credit to purchase these buses
is being provided by ALBA-Caruna with an 8 year pay back period and a
2%
annual interest rate. <br>
      <br>
During the recent visit of a high level Russian government delegation
to Nicaragua (June 2010), an agreement was signed in which Russia
committed to donating a further 250 buses to replace obsolete veh icles
in the rest of the country. Additionally 500 Ladas will be provided
under preferential payment conditions to replace ageing taxis
throughout
Nicaragua. </span><br>
      <br>
In terms of the other component of the government's public transport
policy - the provision of subsidized fuel - the government has
maintained a permanent subsidy for public transport in Managua and
introduced periodical fuel subsidies for public transport in the rest
of the country when the price of fuel is particularly high.<br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">50% transport subsidy in Managua
brought an end to regular transport strikes</span><br>
      <br>
Undoubtedly the most extreme example of just how unsustainable the
public transport system had become prior to the FSLN's 2006 electoral
victory was the situation in Managua in 2005 and 2006 when violent and
massively disruptive prolonged bus strikes became a regular
occurrence.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In order to get an idea
of how disruptive these strikes were it is important to take into
account the fact that, according to government figures, anything up to
one million Nicaraguans (around 18% of the nation's entire population)
uses public buses in Managua each day.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span> For school children, students,
the unemployed or low income
workers there is no affordable travel alternative to buses in the
capital city.&nbsp; <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The combination of
rising expenditure and the inability to charge more for transport
services</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> created a situation in which the quality
and security of Managua's public transport fleet was seriously
compromised while transport strikes presented
themselves as an inevitable vent for the abandoned sector's discontent.<br>
      <br>
Even before the FSLN came to power in January 2007, however, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">the party was able to play a leadong role in solving this ongoing problem. In April 2006 the
then FSLN Mayor of Managua, Dionisio Marenco,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> led a delegation of Nicaraguan mayors to
Venezuela where an agreement permitting oil to be exported to Nicaragua
from Venezuela under extremely preferential payment conditions was
signed with the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.<br>
      <br>
Despite the numerous obstacles created by former president Enrique
Bolaños' government to prevent the Venezuelan oil actually
entering Nicaragua, Marenco was able, in October 2006, to oversee the
provision of subsidized fuel to Managua's public transportation sector
as part of the agreement with PDVSA, thus permitting the fare to be
reduced from C$3 to C$2.5.<br>
      <br>
Ever since then, and despite soaring international oil prices, the FSLN
has been able to maintain the bus fare in the capital city
at C$2.5 (US$0.12) thanks to the government's ability to subsidize
fuel, something made possible as a result of Nicaragua's membership of
ALBA. <br>
      <br>
According to official calculations, the real price of public transport
in Managua today is C$5 (US$0.25). With the 50% government subsidy,
however, the tariff in Managua is lower than in any other Central
American capital city&nbsp; (see table below): <br>

The success of the transport policy implemented in Managua is reflected
by the fact that during the three and a half years of the FSLN
government there has not been one public transport strike in the
capital city. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fuel subsidies have prevented
further fare increases in other parts of the country </span><br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
Over the last couple of years the FSLN government's strategic policy to
mitigate the potentially disastrous effects of unprecedented fuel price
increases and fluctuations on public transport in the rest of the
country has been to subsidize fuel
purchases f</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">or all</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> road and marine transport when
fuel prices are particularly high.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
This
national fuel subsidy, like the fuel subsidy in Managua, is made
possible only as a result of Nicaragua's membership of ALBA.</span><br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
The provision of subsidized fuel for public transport at a national
level was first introduced in May 2008, when the international oil
price was peaking at historic levels of well over US$130 a barrel. Soaring
fuel prices provoked a number of
Nicaraguan transport organizations to declare a national transport
strike on May 4th of that year. On May 16th, after twelve days of disruption and
million dollar losses,
President
Ortega announced his government's decision to subsidize purchases of
gasoline and diesel to the tune of US$1.30 per gallon for up to five
gallons a day for all public buses, taxis, small boats and ferries. In
return transport providers were instructed not to increase fares.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A number of the main
protagonists of the strike </span>had been demanding the
government freeze the price of fuel at 50% the going rate <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">in a blatant attempt to undermine the
government's capacity to meet the striker's demands therefore ensuring
the indefinite continuation of the strike</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span>
      <br>
      <br>
The majority of the participating transport cooperatives - the ones
whose participation meant the strike had an effect in the first
place - celebrated Ortega's announcement of a US$1.30 discount on fuel,
however, and called off the
strike on May 17th.&nbsp; <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
The 2008 transport subsidy was maintained for nine months, eventually
being suspended in
January 2009 after the international oil price dropped to US$41.74 a
barrel (less than a third of the June 2008 peak price of US$133.93 a
barrel).</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Over the last 12 months,
however, the price of oil has again begun to
climb, although more gradually than in 2008, reaching US$84.48 a barrel
in April 2010. This latest increase has again created problems in terms
of the financial sustainability of the public transport system in
Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The government's "investment" to
guarantee production</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
The government responded to this situation by announcing the
reintroduction of fuel subsidies </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">for
all terrestrial and marine transport</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> on April 30th. This time the discount is
worth
US$0.35 a gallon on gasoline and US$0.40 a gallon on diesel.&nbsp; </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
The table below shows the average price of fuel at Nicaraguan gas
stations in May 2008 when the first subsidy was introduced, in January
2009 when it was suspended and in May 2010 when the latest subsidy was
introduced. Also shown are the reduced prices paid by public transport
providers in May 2008 and May 2010 taking into account the government
subsidy: <br>

      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On several occasions
government
representatives have described the public transport policy as a key
priority for the government. President Ortega himself has often mentioned the
vital
importance a functional, accessible transport system represents in
terms
of the economic and social well-being of the poor majority as well as
the overall economic
viability of the nation.<br>
      <br>
In a recent speech the President suggested his government's
program of financial support for the public transport system "should
not be
considered a subsidy, but a government investment to guarantee
production." <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem of unregulated fuel
prices</span><br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Perhaps the main
obstacle preventing further financial sustainability within the public
transport system is the lack of legislation permitting government
regulation of fuel prices. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Unlike</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> in the case of the electricity tariff
and the price of
cooking gas, fuel prices are not regulated by the government's energy
regulatory body, INE. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a result, while oil
price increases are consistently reflected by
corresponding increases in the price of fuel at Nicaraguan gas
stations, oil price
reductions at an international level are not necessarily reflected with
corresponding proportional fuel price reductions. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This problem is
demonstrated by the fact that while the international
price of oil decreased by 67% between May 2008 and January 2009, the
price of gasoline at Nicaraguan gas stations fell by just 40% during
the same period.<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This asymmetry between
international oil price fluctuations and fluctuations in the price of
fuel at local gas stations is the
cause of much discontent among Nicaraguan drivers and the transport
sector in general. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>
When questioned by journalists about this situation in
September 2008, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">presidential economic advisor </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bayardo Arce, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">pointed
out
that it is the US
multinational Exxon Mobil (which owns the only oil refinery in
Nicaragua) that
effectively sets fuel price margins within the country. <br>
      <br>
Because Nicaraguan law does not contemplate fuel price regulation, the
Exxon refinery is free to </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">sell
refined
petroleum products on to the different fuel distribution companies
operating in Nicaragua</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> at
whatever price it likes. And of course the complete lack of
competition, due to there being no other refineries in Nicaragua,
exacerbates the situation.<br>
      <br>
During the second half of 2008 there was great public pressure in
favour of the introduction of fuel price
regulation. This pressure resulted
in the ratification in September 2008 of a reform that would introduce
such
regulation. That reform has not yet been regulated by the National
Assembly, however, which means that it
has not come into force.<br>
      <br>
It is impossible to know the reasons behind the National Assembly's
failure to bring this legislation into effect, but one can speculate that it is
unlikely Exxon would give up its ability to exploit the monopoly it has
on refining petroleum for all it is worth without attempting to
blackmail the
different branches of government with threats of potentially
devastating actions concerning the future of its refinery in Nicaragua.
      </span><br>
      <br>
Of course when operations at the "Bolívar's Supreme Dream" oil
refinery commence, which is scheduled to happen in 2013, the current
situation is likely to change significantly. It remains to be seen in
