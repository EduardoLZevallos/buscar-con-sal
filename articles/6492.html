<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE FSLN<br />
TO THE VIRTUAL SOLIDARITY MEETING<br />
"NICARAGUA, REVOLUTION AND PROGRESS”<br />
OF THE PLATFORM FOR SOLIDARITY WITH NICARAGUA IN SPAIN</strong></p>

<p>Good afternoon, Sisters and Brothers:</p>

<p>Before I begin, I ask you to let me dedicate this meeting, this space of struggle, awareness and hope, to the thousands of innocent martyrs of the criminal aggression of the State of Israel against the people of Gaza. To the children whose names have been lost in the rubble, to the mothers and fathers who mourn them with their souls in pieces, to the families who resist under the roar of the bombs. May their memory inspire us to continue fighting for life, dignity and true justice!</p>

<p>I bring you a fraternal and revolutionary greeting from Commander Daniel Ortega and Compañera Rosario Murillo, Co-Presidents of our beloved Nicaragua, land of Sandino and Darío, where every day we sow hope, harvesting dignity and building  a future of popular sovereignty, social justice and love for the People.</p>

<p>Our History, Sisters and Brothers, is written with blood, but also with dreams. It is marked by the resistance of a People who have never accepted oppression as their destiny, nor injustice as normality. It is the story of the rebellious tenderness, of collective courage, of unshakable strength that has allowed us to walk shoulder to shoulder with the peoples who, as you do, feel, vibrate and live as their own, every act, every word, every revolutionary victory of Nicaragua’s people.</p>

<p>We come from centuries of struggle against empires: from brutality of colonialism to the Yankee interventions, passing through new, more sophisticated forms of domination: criminal blockades, financial blackmail disguised as cooperation, hateful media campaigns — that media war — seeking to discredit, destroy and halt, with lies and legal artifices, the legitimate advances of sovereign peoples.</p>

<p>But Nicaragua is not giving up. Nicaragua will never surrender.</p>

<p>From the glorious deed of Sandino, our General of Free Men and Women, who confronted, overthrew and expelled the interventionist forces of Yankee imperialism, through the likewise heroic deed of the Sandinista Popular Revolution of 1979, which confronted and defeated the Somoza dictatorship, we resisted and defeated the U.S.-funded counterrevolution, we defeated the failed coup attempt of 2018, and we continue to confront with dignity, with truth and with people, every attempt to undermine our path.</p>

<p>And today, Comrades, Nicaragua is moving forward. Move forward with firm steps and concrete achievements:</p>

<p>    • A growing economy with social justice as its horizon,<br />
    • New infrastructure reaching every corner of our Nation,<br />
    • Clean, renewable energy supplying over 75% of national consumption,<br />
    • Free, concerned, dignified and humane health care,<br />
    • Free, universal and liberating education.</p>

<p>And it is also advancing with women as protagonists, as political subjects, as a transformational force. In Nicaragua, women lead ministries, local governments, public enterprises and social movements. Not as an exception, but as the rule. Because in our revolution, we have understood that, without women, there is no justice. Without women, there is no freedom. Without women, there is no Revolution.</p>

<p>Today we are among first places in the global indices of parity in public positions, with more than 50% female representation in the National Assembly, in the Judiciary and in the Electoral Council, as well as in ministries, in municipalities and in strategic decision-making spaces. It is not a coincidence, it is a direct consequence of a revolutionary project that from its origins depended on the leading participation of women as an essential condition for the Liberation of the People.</p>

<p>We defend each of the social and cultural rights conquered since 1979. The land for those who work it. Education as a right, not as a commodity. Popular culture as a living expression of the soul of our people. The right to live with dignity, to dream without limits.</p>

<p>And yes, we also resisted. We took the United States to the International Court of Justice for its dirty Contra War, the one that bathed our land in blood. And we won, they were convicted.  They owe us a historical reparation that they have never fulfilled. But we continue to demand justice, with our heads held high.</p>

<p>And today, too, from this rostrum, we raise our voice in the face of Israel's crimes. Because you can't talk about human rights and be silent in the face of genocide. One cannot speak of peace and justify the massacre of a people who simply seek to exist. Nicaragua has denounced Israel before the international courts, and will continue to do so, as long as there is a single Palestinian child who suffers, who dies, who resists under the bombs. As long as there is even just one Palestinian mother crying out in the middle of the rubble, our voices will accompany her.</p>

<p>Compañeras, compañeros, sisters, brothers:</p>

<p>Solidarity is not a gesture, it is a trench of living struggle. Today, more than ever, we need that trench to be strengthened and multiplied. Compañeras, compañeros, you who have wholeheartedly embraced our revolutionary cause, who have walked alongside the Nicaraguan people in difficult moments and in shared victories, we make an urgent and fraternal appeal to you: may your voice resound in every corner where possible, denouncing the brutal and inhuman aggression of the government of Israel against the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>We thank you deeply for being here, for not looking the other way, for putting body, word, heart and action at the service of justice.</p>

<p>Silent indignation is not enough, we need concrete actions: mobilizations, public pronouncements. Let the people's cry for Palestine be heard. May your hands continue to be hands of solidarity, active, rebellious in the face of genocide.</p>

<p>Because if something unites us as Peoples in Resistance, it is the certainty that there is no true Peace as long as there is injustice, that there are no Human Rights with bombs falling on defenseless peoples. And as you know very well: the pain of an oppressed people has no borders.</p>

<p>From Nicaragua, we call on you to redouble solidarity, to let the cry of "Free Palestine!"be heard in all languages and for those languages to have a revolutionary accent.</p>

<p>Today more than ever, we need your voice, your commitment, your fire.</p>

<p>From Nicaragua we say, forcefully:</p>

<p>The revolution is alive. It beats in our schools, vibrates in our women, flourishes in our hospitals, and also resists in the trenches of our dignity in the face of empire.</p>

<p>And from the depths of the Latin American Soul, we join the cry of the Peoples for Palestine:</p>

<p>Gaza is not alone! Palestine will win!</p>

<p>Long live Blessed and Forever Free Nicaragua!</p>

<p>Thanks you very much!</p>
