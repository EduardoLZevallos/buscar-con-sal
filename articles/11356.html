	<p><b>Reference</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>On 10 February 2021, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted the Draft General Observation of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities regarding the Right to Work and Employment, in accordance with article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The deadline for submitting contributions is March 15, 2021.</p>

<ol start="2" type="I">
	<li>
	<p><b>General Considerations of the Observation Project</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The Nicaraguan Ombudsman for Human Rights considers that the Draft Observation has been developed in accordance with the provisions of the International Human Rights Instruments governing the human right to work and employment<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="11356.html#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc" id="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a>, and in particular with its own regulations to guarantee this right to persons with disabilities, in accordance with article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<p>The Institution considers that the normative content of Article 27 is structured in such a way that it addresses the essential elements for making this right a reality, in line with General Comments of the United Nations Treaty Bodies.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="11356.html#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc" id="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

	<p><b>Good Practices<br />
	of the State of Nicaragua</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The right to work is conceived in the Republic of Nicaragua as an essential right for the realization of other human rights and to guarantee its exercise and enjoyment among the population, is to contribute to the respect for human dignity of all, without discrimination.</p>

<p>The State of Nicaragua has demonstrated the importance it attaches to the right to work and employment for all persons within the national territory and in particular for persons with disabilities, as it allows them to become major actors in national development, but above all, it gives them the necessary conditions to contribute to their development and that of their family.</p>

<ol type="a">
	<li>
	<p><b>Constitutional Guarantees of Nicaraguans with regard to the Right to Work and Employment</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua (1987), the product of the Sandinista People's Revolution (1979), is an emblematic constitutional text that contemplates and regulates the fundamental rights of the Nicaraguan nation, in accordance with the International Instruments of Human Rights. Therefore, in the national territory, Nicaraguans have the constitutional right to work, according to their human nature.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="11356.html#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc" id="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Constitutional reforms promoted throughout history, in order to adjust the text to new contexts, have ensured that persons with disabilities are seen as essential actors of the Nicaraguan nation, without discrimination.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN), as part of the Second Stage of the Sandinista People's Revolution, promoted a constitutional reform that recognized respect for individual diversity without discrimination, as well as respect and equal rights for persons with disabilities.<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="11356.html#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc" id="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Nicaragua's Political Constitution contains a number of provisions on employment and work, as well as respect for the rights of persons with disabilities, which constitute best practices for providing guarantees to this group, that has been historically violated and excluded by neoliberal governments:</p>

<p>Article 56 of the constitutional text establishes that the State will pay special attention in all its programs to the disabled and the relatives of the fallen and victims of war in general.</p>

<p>In turn, Article 62 establishes, the State will seek to advance programs for the benefit of the disabled for their physical, psychosocial and professional rehabilitation and for their employment.</p>

<p>Title IV Rights, Duties and Guarantees of the Nicaraguan People, Chapter 5 refers to labor rights, Articles 80 to 88 reads as follows:</p>

	<p><b>National Planning with a Human Rights Approach: Plans and Programs of the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN).</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The people of Nicaragua elected the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN) in 2006, which initiated a process of structural change, through a model inspired by Christian principles and values, socialism and solidarity, with forms of work respectful of human rights and committed to groups historically marginalized by neoliberal policies.</p>

<p>Since 2007, the Government of Nicaragua has worked to reduce poverty, achieve a more equitable society based on rights and values; its objective being structural transformation to overcome the exclusion and unlock the potential for human development of the excluded, including the poor, women, young people, indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples, as well as people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The Government of Nicaragua has guided its action through human rights and sustainable development planning through the National Human Development Plan (PNDH) from 2009 to 2011; the National Human Development Plan (PNDH) from 2012 to 2016; as well as the current axes of the National Human Development Program (PNDH) for 2018 to 2021.</p>

<p>The current axes of the National Human Development Program contemplate, as a part of social development, guaranteeing a culture of respect, protection and attention to the fundamental rights of people with disabilities, facilitating their social, educational and labor inclusion, under conditions of equity. In turn, labor rights refer to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Promotion of the stability and development of work and employment in the medium and long term, to reduce unemployment and underemployment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Negotiation of wages and promotion of decent employment and labor productivity, to contribute to social and labor stability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Develop the knowledge and skills needed for the good performance of workers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Strengthen a culture of prevention of occupational risks and diseases in the workplace, in order to ensure the occupational health and safety of workers.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The sixth axis refers to work and prosperity in the following terms:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Promote policies for the generation of jobs in all forms, promoting formality.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Dignify and promote the generation of self-employment to establish personal and family businesses and offer services.</p>
	</li>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ensure access to social security benefits and collective conventions for workers.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" type="a">
	<li>
	<p><b>Progressive advances in the enjoyment and fulfillment of the right to work and employment of persons with disabilities in Nicaragua</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>In Nicaragua, the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN) has implemented Public Policies aimed at ensuring non-discrimination for persons with disabilities and has promoted the adoption of measures to enable the exercise and enjoyment of their right to earn a living through work, freely chosen and accepted by themselves and to preserve it, as part of their progress within society.</p>

<p>As part of the political will of the Government of Nicaragua and its real commitment toward persons with disabilities, Nicaragua signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, on 30 March 2007 and has promoted the updating of the national legal framework, in line with the Political Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua and international human rights instruments.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the above, on 13 April 2011, the National Assembly of Nicaragua adopted Law No. 763 "Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities" and its regulations, Decree No. 11-2014; articles that positively affect the right to work and employment of persons with disabilities.</p>

<p>Today, the national legal order ensures<a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="11356.html#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc" id="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a> that persons with disabilities are protected throughout the national territory and above all:</p>

<ul>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ensures non-slavery or servitude.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

	<p>Defines the incentives for the promotion of employment in the private sector.</p>
	</li>

</ol>

<p>The National Institute of Technology (INATEC) implements within its Institutional Study Curriculum, the topics of Entrepreneurship, Business Management, Self-Esteem, Attitude, Responsibility and Hygiene and Health, as a cross-cutting axis in all trainings, in order to contribute to the socio-laboral development of people with disabilities and their best performance in the community.</p>

<p>There is the Department of Professional Rehabilitation, whose objective is to professionally rehabilitate target groups with skills that respond to the demand of the labor market in order to insert them into the socio-laboral and productive life of the country.</p>

	<p><b>Public Employment Service of the Ministry of Labor</b> <b>(Availability)</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN), through the Public Employment Service of the Ministry of Labor has guaranteed a specialized service aimed at supporting persons with disabilities in order to enable them to identify and access available employment.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p><b>Accessibility of persons with disabilities to and conservation<br />
	of employment.</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>In the Republic of Nicaragua, the Ministry of Labor is the institution responsible for ensuring that persons with disabilities can work on an equal footing with other persons, enjoying their labor rights, in accordance with article 34 of the Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<p>Under the above, the Ministry of Labor encourages employers to make reasonable adjustments, adapting the environment and working conditions based on the needs of persons with disabilities, for the exercise of their employment rights and verifying that promotions and are given on the basis of equal opportunities, taking into account capacity and performance within the company, without considering the reasons related to disability.</p>

<p>In line with this, in Nicaragua, any employer whether a public or private entity must take the following actions in compliance with article 25 of the Regulations of the Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and which are monitored by the Ministry of Labor and failure to comply with them constitutes a serious violation:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Adjust your recruitment criteria and requirements by avoiding any cause related to people's disability;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Promote inclusive attitudes towards people with disabilities among workers;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Adapt the environment and working conditions based on the needs of persons with disabilities;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When an active duty worker acquires a disability, he or she will be kept in the same job he was in, before acquiring the disability or placed in another position according to his or her ability, and a pension will ultimately be granted;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Verify that job promotions, relocation and termination of the employment relationship are taken into account by the ability and performance of individuals within the company, without regard to disability-related reasons;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Take the necessary measures to eliminate the rules and practices contrary to equal opportunities and the establishment of measures to avoid any form of discrimination on the basis of disability;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Develop and promote information activities, awareness-raising campaigns and as many others as are necessary for the promotion of equal opportunities and non-discrimination;</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>In the particular case of the National Police and the Nicaraguan Army, they have established Recruitment Protocols that allow persons with some degree of disability to participate on an equal footing to carry out activities that have no direct relationship with operational activities related to the maintenance and restoration of order, public security and the defense of the nation.</p>

<p>National legislation regulates that under no circumstances may persons with disabilities be discriminated against in order to qualify for a position in the Civil Service, and only the capacity of the candidate aspiring to the position must be assessed.</p>

<p>With regard to measures to support labor insertion, the Ministry of Labor, the National Institute of Technology, the Nicaraguan Institute of Social Security and other public institutions, support the employment of persons with disabilities, through individual and collective technical and vocational training policies, self-employment, promoting business opportunities, the establishment of cooperatives and the starting of their own companies.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Labor carries out special support measures, such as: vocational training, grants, cooperation agreements to facilitate labor integration of persons with disabilities; as well as socio-laboral research to improve the integration and improvement of their working conditions.</p>

<p>In this case, the Nicaraguan Institute of Social Security may not suspend or cancel any benefits received by persons with disabilities and may continue to work and pay their individual account, in compliance with article 27 of the Regulations of the Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<p>Likewise, in order to ensure access to the health services of the children of workers born with permanent disabilities, resolution 97/295 was approved on 3 December 2015, which in its numeral 1 provides: <i><b>"Health coverage is granted for the children of rightholders born with a permanent disability".</b></i></p>

<ol start="4">
	<li>
	<p><b>Protection of persons with disabilities at</b><b> </b><b>work and promotion of decent employment</b><b>.</b></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>A good practice of the State of Nicaragua in terms of recruitment is that persons with disabilities, under the principle of equal opportunities and on the basis of the nature of the employment activity to which they are hired, have the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their status, in order to qualify for employment. In the job interview, the employer must take into account only the capacities necessary to fulfill the activities of the job he or she is opting for, on an equal footing with other applicants to the required position, in compliance with section 36 of the Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<p>The State of Nicaragua, through the Ministry of Labor has guaranteed access to all Nicaraguan citizens to all services offered by the Public Employment Service such as: registration, intermediation, individual and group employment orientation, development of labor skills for increased employability. The incorporation of persons with disabilities is processed on the basis of Law No. 763 "Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities", registering in the period 2014-2018, a labor insertion of 666 people with different types of disability. All these services are provided without any discrimination.</p>

<p>The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity through the Ministry of Labor guarantees measures to protect the human rights of workers, through labor consultancies in person, by telephone, by email and in writing; it also provides training on labor legislation through the "Territorial Labor Commissions", which aim to empower workers to be architects in defending their rights. Ensuring effective articulation with social labor movements serving workers has also been consolidated with the aim of ensuring speed and access to administrative labor justice according to the territorial location where the employment relationship was concluded.</p>

<p>The labor legislation in force in the State of Nicaragua, in particular Law No. 664, <b>"General</b><b> </b><b>Labor Inspection Law",</b> is of national application, by means of which inspection plans and programs of care and protection of labor rights are implemented on an equal opportunity and treatment in all processes, in strict adherence to Nicaraguan labor legislation, as well as the safe performance of workers under Law No. 618 <b>"General Law on Occupational Hygiene and Safety."</b></p>

<p>In this sense, the Ministry of Labor, through its Labor Inspectors, ensures that all national, municipal, state and private institutions and enterprises with fifty or more workers include at least two per cent of persons with disabilities in their respective payrolls. In the case of companies with a payroll of more than ten workers and less than fifty, at least one person with a disability must be employed.</p>

<p>The State of Nicaragua through the Ministry of Health promotes the "All with Voice" Program, which has been a fundamental pillar of people with disabilities, who are cared for not only in their health, but also equipped with<i> tools (auxiliary appliances, wheelchairs, walk-ins, canes) and to </i>be independent and create their own ventures.
