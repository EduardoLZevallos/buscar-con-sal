      <br>

In light of the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day it is
worth taking a look at the ideological roots behind the creation
of the annual celebration in the context of the global and local
situation regarding
women's rights today and the extent to which the same countries that
witnessed a series of triumphs in terms of the liberation
of woman during the 20th century, are guilty of obstructing the
struggle of impoverished
women in
other parts of the world today.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

The first International Women's Day was celebrated in the US in 1909
following a declaration by the Socialist Party of
America stating the importance of the recognition of women's rights as
part of a truly socialist process. The next year, during the second
International Socialist Women's Congress in Denmark, the German
feminists Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxembourg and their
colleagues agreed on the need for International Women's Day to be
celebrated every year across the world. <br>

      <br>

Zetkin and Luxembourg, ideological companions of Friedrich Engels and
Vladimir Ilich Lenin, viewed the oppression of women not so much as a
gender
issue but as a class issue. Like the Socialist Party of America
they
believed that true female liberation would only be possible as part of
the creation of a socialist society. <br>

      <br>

During Luxembourg and Zetkin's time, the concrete demands of the
international women's movement were essentially better working
conditions for female workers, universal franchise and other
political rights. As Rebeca Madriz points out in her recent article <a href="http://generoconclase.blogspot.com/2010/03/100-anos-del-dia-internacional-de-la.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">100 years on, let's construct a socialist
future</span></a>, the demands from that time have been
met, at least in legislative terms, in most nations of the
world. "However, the complex social reality [of today's world] has
diversified the forms of discrimination, subordination, exploitation
and submission of women" especially in impoverished regions of the
world:<br>

      
      <div font-style:="" italic;="">
      <blockquote>Capitalism,
in
it's current transnationalized and monopolistic form, has generalized
social phenomenons like the feminization of poverty, ... femicide [the
murder of women for motives of gender], feminicide [femicide
effectively tolerated by the State], and people trafficking mainly of
women
and children.</blockquote>
      </div>

Indeed, it is possible to argue, that the current global reality has to
a large extent divided the world's women, their life experiences and
perspectives, into two broad and diverse categories: women from the
financially rich North and women from the resource rich, financially
impoverished South (illegal immigrants
from the South living in the North can be included in the latter
category). <br>

      <br>

Though frequently women's standard of living in the North is far from
adequate, on the whole the most basic needs (nutrition, water and
sanitation, some form of income, education and basic health care) are
met and basic services (transport, communications, electricity, etc)
are accessible.<br>

      <br>

Meanwhile most women from the South are unable to
fulfill at least one and usually more of their basic needs while basic
services are far from guaranteed in most parts of the majority world.<br>

      <br>

On top of this, the extent to which violence has become an everyday
occurence for women from the South is great. Even relatively
conservative
statistics suggest that over a
third of women in certain parts of the South - Latin America included -
are regular victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Meanwhile,
the toll in terms of death and injury as a result of armed conflict in
the Middle East and
parts of Africa, and the femicide rate in certain parts of Latin
America have reached epidemic
levels. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

Ironically, the North's insistence on the formalization of political
rights in Southern countries' legislation over the last few decades
has, in many cases,
artificially and counteractively hurried along social liberation
processes, including the empowerment of women. But, simultaneously, the
social reality and the situation regarding human and economic rights,
especially for women, in
those
same countries has continued to worsen as a result of the imposition of
neo-liberal free market economic policies by Northern dominated
international
institutions.<br>

      <br>

There is a sense in which, the artificial process by which political
rights and social minded legislation have been achieved in many
Southern nations, has actually stunted social progress and specifically
progress in terms of the liberation of women. For example, if - as
has occurred in many southern nations - the conquest of women's
right to
the vote is not the result of an organic feminist struggle,
many elements, including the awareness-raising element of that sort of
struggle, simply never exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>

In their article <a href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/es/node/5478"><span style="font-style: italic;">Death to Patriarchy - but really</span></a>
journalist Jorge Capellán and women's rights activist Maria <strong style="font-weight: normal;">Söderqvist</strong> deal with the
tendency towards a problematic North-South division within the
international women's
movement, something they argue has converted itself into a tendency for
women's groups from the North to patronize, even to "infantilize,"
their
Southern sisters - a tendency often exacerbated by the Northern
cultures'
misuse of the term, "machismo:"<br>

      
      <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Machismo simply
means patriarchy of the
type found in the third world, above all in Latin America. The concept
[of machismo] is very convenient [because it allows] those who don't
want to think of patriarchy as a global phenomenon ... to avoid talking
about a world system of oppression of women and instead to talk about
the oppression of women taking place only in certain remote and
"peripheric" countries.</span><br>
      </blockquote>

According to Capelán and <strong style="font-weight: normal;">Söderqvist,
      </strong>this way of understanding and referring to machismo
facilitates the concealment of the crucial historic and modern-day role
rich country intervention in the South has had in the creation and
sustenance of some of the most crippling aspects of machismo in terms
of women's rights.<br>

      <br>

Towards the end of their article the authors argue that,
simultaneously, "this ideology about machismo contributes to the
[tendency to] infantilize the struggle for women's rights" in the
South,
given its logic that "women in the third world are nothing more than
victims of the local patriarchy" - victims in need of salvation:<br>

      
      <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">[According to
this logic] the veiled woman punching her fist in the air and shouting
"death to Israel" during a protest in Palestine, is not exercising her
right to participate in a political struggle against the occupation
that threatens her children's existence - she is simply a victim of
Islam. The campesina [rural woman] who shouts "long live Daniel Ortega"
during a protest in Nicaragua is not celebrating because, for the first
time, she has access to land, credit, medical assistance and education,
but is a brain wash victim of the "Ortega dictatorship." &nbsp; <br>
        </span></blockquote>

Indeed, with regards to the specific case of Nicaragua's FSLN
government, it is interesting to note that most international women's
organizations from the
North have never bothered to acknowledge the very positive advances in
terms of
women's rights since the FSLN's rise to power in 2007. <br>

      <br>

A brief summary of those advances was given in an article by the
Special Commission on Women and the Fight Against Poverty in their
article <a href="http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/72129">From
rhetoric
to practice - women lead the fight against poverty in Nicaragua</a>
which links the FSLN's gender policy to the 12 key points of the1995 <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/declar.htm">Beijing
Declaration</a> about the human rights of women. <br>

      <br>

As well as the well known government programs "Zero Hunger" and "Zero
Usury"
which&nbsp; exclusively benefit women and which between them have
provided over 120,000 rural and urban women with the tools and training
they need
to produce food (rural women) or start a small business (urban women),
the government, in just three years, has also:<br>

      
      <ul>
<li>constructed and rehabilitated infrastructure to provide
virtually free, quality childcare for over 90,000
children of working single mothers </li><li>given out over 50,000 land titles to impoverished families
previously living with legal uncertainty regarding their living
arrangements </li><li>reduced the illiteracy rate from nearly 30% to under 5% </li><li>dramatically increased the number of girls and boys from
impoverished communities to enroll and remain in school - reducing the
school desertion rate to 6% (a historic low) thanks to, among many
other things, the introduction of free school meals</li><li>transformed and modernized the national curriculum for
primary and secondary education introducing transversal themes like
gender equality and the protection of the environment <br>
        </li><li>increased by 122% the amount of medicine available as
part of the public health system</li><li>increased by 68% the number of specialist consultations
within the public health system</li><li>reduced the maternal mortality rate by 25.6%</li><li>reduced the neo-natal mortality rate by 17% &nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
      </ul>

Also as part of the FSLN's comittment to women's rights, the party has
created a Women's Secretariat, consisting of a framework of
representatives at a community, municipal, departmental and national
level, whose specific purpose is to ensure 50% female representation in
all party structures and within the executive controlled government
institutions. The first concrete example of the effectiveness of the
Women's Secretariat was that 50% of the candidates put forward by the
FSLN for the 2008 municipal elections were women.<br>

&nbsp; <br>

Interestingly, of the 19 female deputies and 15 female supplement
deputies in the National Assembly (Nicaragua's legislative body), 90%
are FSLN representatives.<br>

      <br>

These outstanding social advances for women have been completely
ignored
by the majority of feminist and pro-women and human rights
organizations in the North. The same organizations, however, have put
great emphasis on the controversial ban on therapeutic abortion in
Nicaragua. In itself this emphasis is more than justifiable, but the
fact that
everything else to do with the FSLN gender policy is consistently
omitted dramatically reduces the moral authority with which these
organizations condemn the Nicaraguan government:&nbsp;
      
      <ul>
<li>Human Right's Watch, which describes itself as<strong></strong>
"one of the world&#8217;s leading independent organizations dedicated to
defending and protecting human rights," <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/03/07/nicaraguans-international-women-s-day-marks-step-back">wrote
in 2008</a> that "until recently, Nicaraguan women had something to
celebrate on ... International Women&#8217;s Day. ... But today, instead of
building on ... hard-won protections, Daniel
Ortega&#8217;s government is chipping away at the very laws that put them in
place."<br>
        </li><li>Radical Women, which describes itself as an "international
socialist&nbsp; and feminist organization," in <a href="http://www.radicalwomen.org/nicaragua_harassment.html">a public
letter</a> to Daniel Ortega regarding therapeutic abortion issued in
response to a call for support by the Movimiento Autonomo de Mujeres
(an organizations which itself forms part of the political opposition
alliance, MRS), wrote, "Mr. Ortega, you once participated in one of
this hemisphere's most
inspirational revolutions for social and economic justice. Now, your
government has turned the gains of the Nicaraguan people's revolution
on their head."</li><li>AWID, the Association for Women's Rights in Development,
which describes itself as an
"international, multi-generational, feminist, creative,
future-orientated membership organization committed to achieving gender
equality, sustainable development and women's human rights," published
similar arguments in an article entitled <a href="http://www.awid.org/eng/Issues-and-Analysis/Library/The-government-war-on-women-s-rights-in-Nicaragua">The
government's war on women's rights in Nicaragua</a>.</li><li>The <a href="http://www.justicewomen.com/archives/2008/12-Oct-2008_to_19-Oct-2008.php">Women's
Justice Center</a>, a California based outfit, and the London based
news outlet <a href="http://womensphere.wordpress.com/category/issue/feminism/page/2/">Womansphere</a>
were among a number of other feminist and pro women organizations in
the US and Europe to publish a derogatory article about Ortega and his
wife Rosario Murillo entitled "Ortega vs. the Feminists."&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      
      <p>In fact, if one googles the words "Daniel Ortega" and "women's
rights" it soon becomes apparent that among Northern feminist circles
Ortega and his government are commonly refered to as "anti-feminist."
One will also soon become aware that it is practically impossible to
find information in English about all the ways in which Ortega's
government has actually been responsible for dramatically improving the
chances of women being able to exercise all the rights they have on
paper, but not often in practice.<br>
      </p>

When trying to understand the reasons behind the generalized failure of
progressive women's organizations in the North to acknowledge the
social achievements in Nicaragua, one cannot overlook the role of the
corporate mass media in terms
of the creation and diffusion of mis- and dis-information about the
FSLN's
government approach to women's rights (and pretty much everything
else!). <br>

      <br>

At the same time, though, it is hard to believe that activists and
other progressives in the North would be unable to get their hands on
information about all the successful government programs should they so
desire. <br>

      <br>

With this in mind one is lead to believe that, at least regarding
Nicaragua, Capellan and <strong style="font-weight: normal;">Söderqvist
are right to identify a
tendency for woman's organizations in the North "to impose their own
agendas on the women of the rest of the world."&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
As previously stated, the<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> main
objection to the FSLN government by woman's groups in the North is the
ban on therapeutic abortion which was passed
by the three main parties (FSLN, PLC and ALN) in October 2006. </strong>When
analyzing different approaches to this issue, one
must bear in mind the fact that the women's movement in the North is in
a logistically strong position in terms of the fight for and
conquest of significant advances regarding abortion rights.&nbsp; One
should remember that there is a long history of public debate as well
as a relative lack of church interference in political decisions on
this sort of issue in the North. <br>

      <br>

In countries like Nicaragua, however, this is not the case. While the
pro-choice
struggle does exist and should be supported, the social, political,
economic and religious correlation of forces is such that any advance
on the issue of abortion has not, so far, proved itself a realizable
goal. One of the main factors to be taken into account here is the
dominant cultural<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>attitude
towards abortion - as part of <a href="http://archivo.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2007/abril/24/noticias/nacionales/186981.shtml">a
poll</a> carried out in 2007, 58.5% of Nicaraguans said they did not
believe an abortion should be carried out even if the mother's life was
in danger as a result of her pregnancy, while 68.7% said they didn't
think an abortion should be permitted if a pregnancy is the result of
rape.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

These statistics serve to demonstrate the extent to which cultures
differ. Those dedicated enough to the struggle for women's rights in
Nicaragua to attempt to influence the current cultural mentality
regarding this issue need to keep in mind the fact that <strong style="font-weight: normal;">sustainable and long-lasting processes of
progressive social
transformation</strong> necessarily evolve with and from the cultural
beliefs, spiritual needs and day-to-day experiences of the society
itself. <br>

      <br>

Unquestionably one of the greatest obstacles in the way of creating a
more positive cultural attitude towards women and women's rights in
Latin Amercia is the corporate mass media's insistence on almost
permanent, mind-numbing violent and degrading programming which, when
it isn't normalizing violence, serves to reinforce the most
conservative of the Catholic Churches ideas about society. From Mexican
and Colombian tele-novelas and US action and war movies to <span style="font-style: italic;">nota roja</span> style TV news coverage,
corporate TV channels communicate virtually non-stop, degrading
subliminal messages about women and the rest of society. <br>

      <br>

And yet, so far, all attempts by progressive Latin American government
to oblige the media to act with greater social responsability have been
jumped on by Northern governments, the international corporate media
and a number of Northern NGOs with claims about disrespect of freedom
of speech. A classic example is the Venezuelan RCTV case: <br>

      <br>

After the channel ignored numerous government warnings to verify
consistent breaches of national legislation regarding programming
timetables and the veracity of sources used in news reporting, Hugo
Chavez' government decided not to renew RCTV's public license. Among
other anomalies committed by RCTV was the broadcasting of pornography
during the day. The move to cancel RCTV's license was condemned by
governments, NGOs and other institutions throughout the US and Europe,
though the details behind the case were seldom, if ever, made available
for discussion. <br>

      <br>

In terms of confronting the troubling increase in femicide and
feminicide, a phenomenon particularly present in Mexico, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Honduras, the effective implementation of much stricter
rules and regulations for the media would be an enormously positive
first step. <br>

      <br>

As psycologist Monica Zalaquett, (Director of the Center for the
Prevention of Violence in Nicaragua) explains to journalist Giorgio
Trucchi in <a href="http://www.rel-uita.org/mujer/femicidio_en_nicaragua.htm">an
interview</a> published in 2008, a major factor in the ongoing increase
in domestic violence and femicide in the region is the high rate of
male un- and under-employment in recent years and the simultaneous
increase in female employment (both results of neo-liberal economic
policy) which has resulted in what she identifies as a crisis of
machismo itself:<br>

      <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">When you take
away a man's purchasing power you are taking away part of his masculine
identity, an identity intrinsically associated with work and the role
of provider. At the same time this role [of provider] has gradually
been adopted by more and more women. ...<br>
      <br>
In other words, a change in terms of the traditional power relationship
has been imposed, but at home women are still totally unprotected, they
are trapped in no man's land where impunity and family dictatorship
reign. ... Taking away a man's purchasing power is a detonant for
violence - violence
which is used to restitute the power men feel is taken away along with
their ability to provide. ... We have masculinized women without
feminizing men.<br>
      </span></blockquote>

      
Zalaquett concludes by emphasizing the importance of focusing on
education and media and of including men in attempts to resolve the
troubling situation regarding domestic violence and femicide.<br>

      <br>

From the grinding reality of extreme poverty and the soul-destroying
daily routine of violence and danger to the social and moral oppression
of reactionary religious, economic, political and social de facto
powers, women in the South face major obstacles in terms of the
realization of their rights, even when their country's legislation
recognizes those rights. This is not an excuse, however, for
progressive organizations in the North to view them as victims, or to
arbitrarily use their own power and influence to provide false or
incomplete information about governments and organizations working to
promote a pro-woman agenda at a grass roots level.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

      <br>

The concrete results of the FSLN's commitment to empowering women are
outstanding and yet, at the same time, given the crude and depressing
reality, effectively constitute only the tiniest step forward in terms
of actually overcoming the desperate situation faced by Nicaragua's
women. Women's organizations in the North should revise their
attitude towards the FSLN government and spend more time studying the
effects of their own country's colonialist past and neo-colonialist
present before attacking left wing and socialists governments in the
South. <br>

      <br>

The FSLN's commitment to and prioritization of the empowerment of women
within the overall struggle to overcome age old inequality in
Nicaraguan society is the result of the same logic used by Clara Zetkin
and Rosa Luxemburg when they defined gender struggle as an integral
part of class struggle.
