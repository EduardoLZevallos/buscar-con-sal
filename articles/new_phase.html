President Barack Obama remarked last week that he could not just press
a button to restore Manuel Zelaya to the Honduran presidency he was
saying one of two things. Either the President of the United States is
not inclined to implement the resolution of the Organization of
American States on Honduras that his government supported, or else,
absurdly,&nbsp;he is unable to. Obama wheeled out a mediocre right-wing
sophistry, arguing that, now, critics who have always condemned intervention by
the United States are calling for just such an intervention. <br><br>But
Manuel Zelaya and other critics of the United States government's
record in Latin America and elsewhere are not demanding intervention.
What they seek is that the United States meet its obligations in
accordance with resolutions of the OAS and the United Nations to
expedite the immediate restitution of Manuel Zelaya as the legitimate
president of Honduras. It is the United States that has for decades
trained the Honduran military at the School of the Americas in forced
disappearances, torture and repression of civilian populations. <br><br>It
is United States multinationals that have benefited for decades in
Honduras from an absurdly concessionary tax regime to accumulate
extortionate profits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars every
year. It is the United States that has equipped the Honduran army to
murder, disappear and detain the heroic non-violent Honduran resistance.
It is the United States that has constantly intervened in Honduran
government policy against the interests of the country's impoverished
majority. And now the consummate opportunist hypocrite Barack Obama
glibly sneers that he cannot press a button to help Manuel Zelaya.<br><br>Honduras - diplomacy in the balance<br><br>Obama
may not feel inclined to lift a finger to press a button, but other
fingers, thousands of them, can press a trigger. Barack Obama and
Hillary Clinton have actively worsened things in Honduras through their
double talk and their fatuous, short-sighted delaying tactics in
cahoots with perennial US government accomplice Oscar Arias. As a
result of their failure to take decisive steps to quash the coup, they
have forced Manuel Zelaya and the popular movement in Honduras&nbsp;to
adopt the tactics of a slowly escalating war of attrition.<br><br>The
strategy of President Zelaya has been to exhaust all diplomatic options
while relying on non-violent resistance by the internal popular
opposition to pressure the coup regime into concessions. The diplomatic
route has indeed been exhausted. The price of that strategy has been
dozens of people killed, scores forcibly disappeared, hundreds wounded,
thousands detained. Complete details of the massive human rights
violations committed by the coup regime will only become clear in the
weeks and months to come. It is a story ignominiously neglected by the
imperialist propaganda machinery of the corporate mainstream media and
too by most of the alternative media.<br><br>Reliance on lacklustre
diplomacy and the absence of meaningful sanctions against the coup
regime have brought about a stalemate. The US and its allies are urging
Manuel Zelaya to sign the pro-coup regime Arias agreement. Now it is
Manuel Zelaya's turn to play for time. He and his team are likely to
string out negotiations that stumble on several key points. Firstly,
the coup regime will not accept Zelaya's return to the presidency and
are insisting that any interim government include their nominees for
key ministries controlling defence and internal security.<br><br>Secondly,
the popular opposition inside Honduras will never accept the Arias
plan's proposal of impunity for the coup leaders and the military, who
have at this stage committed a series of impardonable crimes. Thirdly,
it is absolutely clear that Zelaya is in no position to agree to the
Arias plan's insistence on a veto of any national constituent assembly.
That demand by the Honduran popular movement is by now decisively out
of Manuel Zelaya's hands.<br><br>Inside Honduras - a new phase<br><br>Over
the next few days, Manuel Zelaya and his team are likely to drag out
talks and negotiations knowing that things inside Honduras will most
probably change dramatically if the coup regime continues its
intransigence. By tomorrow, Tuesday August 11th, hundreds of thousands of
peaceful demonstrators will have converged on the two main Honduran
cities, Tegucigalpa, the capital, and San Pedro Sula, the main
industrial centre. If the army and police try again to repress these
massive displays of peaceful support for Manuel Zelaya, a sudden change
in tactics by the popular oppposition can hardly be discounted.<br><br>Honduras
is a very small country. Most people are well aware who the coup
leaders are. They also know that coup regime de facto leader Roberto
Micheletti's security adviser, John Negroponte's and Robert Callahan's
former death squad protege Billy Joya and his sinister cronies have a
death list of over one hundred popular movement leaders. Only the most
optimistic Pollyanna could think armed violence in Honduras can be
avoided in such circumstances. Popular opposition leaaders in Honduras
are not going to wait passively while&nbsp;coup regime death squads
murder them and intimidate their families under the benign gaze of the
United States government.<br><br>Many of the coup leaders - for
example, Carlos Facussé, Jorge Canahuati, Ricardo Maduro, the banker
Jorge Bueso Arias -&nbsp; are well aware of this reality. Some have
already moved their families to Miami. The wealthy oligarchs who
organized the coup are depending on the fact that they bribed senior
military officers with millions of dollars - one figure reported
suggests as much as US$11 million - to ensure the coup holds firm. As
the conflict in Honduras enters a new phase, the oligarchs and their US
backers are likely to see their expensive investment sorely and
bloodily tested.<br><br>toni writes for www.tortillaconsal.com</td></tr></tbody></table><br>
