for the Midday Edition of Multinoticias Channel 4<br />
<br />
December 27th 2023</strong></em></h3>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="500" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario85.jpg.html" width="400" /></p>

<p>Warmest greetings, compañera. Here we are, content and proud as ever to serve our People, and, if God gives us the Health and Energy, to work harder and harder so as to continue changing Nicaragua, for the better, always for the better... To live calmly and securely... To live working and prospering... To live in Harmony, and I stress, in Tranquility, in Security, in Peace and Concord.<br />
Many have wanted to upset that Harmony, that Peace...! Many may have broken it momentarily! But our people know that Peace is the greatest treasure we have.</p>

<p>Concord and Peace allow us to move forward along paths of a future for the Common Good. Paths of Faith! Because Faith is an attribute, it is a Virtue, it is a Value, a Quality, indispensable in the life of Nicaraguan Families. And Faith is very personal. It cannot be commanded, one cannot be ordered to have faith. One cannot claim dominion or ownership over the Faith. There are no owners of the Faith!</p>

<p>God gives us all the Heart to live the Faith, without owners who tell us: "Mind, we must have Faith..."No! We must have Faith simply because we have Faith, because we are Beings who have lived, who have been born, who throughout our lives, have grown up in the Conviction that it is with Faith, that it is with Love, that we can go onward.</p>

<p>And the most ridiculous thing, the most laughable thing, are those who with diabolical words, feelings and thoughts still talk about Faith. The real devils are the ones who rang the bells to signal for our people to be killed. The real devils are those who were sowing hatred and speaking in the name of Christ... How astonishing!</p>

<p>The true devils are those who cannot tolerate Love, because it is the most powerful Force that exists, and it is with Love that we have been transcending and overcoming. With love and Hope that no one can take from us, because it belongs to us as People of God!</p>

<p>49 Years ago today, we lived that December 27th that broke the silence to install once more, publicly, because in private it never stopped, establishing the Strength, the Power of the People, the Transformative Power of an Undefeated Spirit.</p>

<p>49 Years ago we lived days that we can never forget, because that day we all saw, we all felt part of the Strength of our People.</p>

<p>49 years ago the silence was broken, because that silence had to end... The silence was broken and we went Forward, towards the Light, towards the Truth, towards the Triumph of the Revolution and the Future of the People who are now President.</p>

<p>Today we are precisely going to be commemorating that Heroic Deed, a Heroic Gesture as formidable as was the feat of the National Palace on August 22.</p>

<p>What sublime dates our People commemorate, going from Heroism to Heroism, from Virtue to Virtue, from Courage to Courage, out of Glory and Honor!</p>

<p>Our Original Peoples knew well how to impose their Victories over Colonialism, step by step. There and here is the Undefeated Soul of our Original Leaders, and then, all that firmament of Heroes whom we are proud to name every day, the pride of being part of that Legacy that we live out knowing that we are Invincible, because we have Soul, because we have Life, because we have Light, because we have Love, because we have Heart!</p>

<p>This afternoon our Comandante Daniel will be remembering Tomás, founder of the Sandinista Front and founder of the Ministry of the Interior; he will be remembering all the Heroes; he will be remembering that Battalion, the “Juan José Quezada” Commando of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, through which each and every one, of us beyond our own Persons, become the Heroism of a People, the Heroism of the People of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation.</p>

<p>There we will be commemorating that Heroic Action that took place in August of '78, another Heroic Gesture and, truly, that Bravery, that Courage, that Sense of Honor, that Sense of Victories, because always when Revolutionary Actions were carried out or are carried out we know that we are a People of Victory, of Victories, of Future, of Future, of Light. We are a People that makes our way ahead and we say with Pride, with Faith of what is True, of  what is Genuine, what is Powerful!</p>

<p>This afternoon our Comandante Daniel will also make other announcements, at the same time he will highlight the appointments of the Compañer@s that give continuity today to all the Heroic Path of the Ministry of the Interior; giving continuity to all the Heroic Deed of defense of the Revolution, of Values, of Combative and Victorious Roots.</p>

<p>Today, when we remember, after 49 years the Heroic Action of the Sandinista Front and the “Juan José Quezada” Command, we also feel in our Hearts, in our veins, the Heroism of a People, because our People were in all the Institutions, as they are now as the People-President in all the Institutions of the Nicaraguan State.</p>

<p>Continuity of Heroic Deeds and, above all, in moments of great Conviction, of great Certainty, of the certainty that the New World has been born and we are part of that New World that is creating Justice, that is creating, with pains of course, Peace, Cooperation, Solidarity, Fraternity... That is creating, out of the Truth, more Truth to live out Fully, with the Sense of Humanity that we deserve.</p>

<p>So in his Message this afternoon, Comandante Daniel will be not only evoking and invoking all those Times past, but launching the New Times that we have been living through, proud of who we are, what we have been, what we are being and what we will be, by the Grace of God!</p>

<p>We are also now, Compañer@s, receiving Notifications from those Governments and Peoples who have accredited Nicaraguan Compañer@s as Representatives of our Heroic People and our Government.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Carlos Eduardo Díaz Moreira has been welcomed as Ambassador of our Nicaragua, People and Government, People-President, to the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. He will be leaving for Algiers in the next few days. Grateful, because we can count on that Representation of who we are, and especially of our historical Brotherhood, as Combative Peoples, Brave Peoples, Heroic Peoples!</p>

<p>We also have, Compañer@s, Compañera Darling Ríos who will be accredited in the People's Republic of Angola, she is over there. And happy, proud, to have Darling, a young, brave, capable woman, at the head of that Diplomatic Representation, and too, concurrently, in different Countries of Heroic Africa.</p>

<p>Then, Compañer@s, today Wednesday we inaugurated the 280th Police Station in the Police Unit of the El Sagrario neighborhood of the City of León.</p>

<p>We are handing over Houses in El Rama, Jinotepe, San Carlos, Morrito, Matagalpa, San Lorenzo, Río Blanco, Boaco, San Dionisio, Totogalpa, Rivas.</p>

<p>New streets in Nueva Guinea, Tola; San Francisco Libre, Cuatro Esquinas, and there are already roads, stretches of roads in different parts of San Francisco Libre, Nagarote, San Isidro, Tuma-La Dalia; such that our<br />
Families are happy, full of Joy, of Trust, of Hope, because every day we know that the Sun shining on us, does not decline, and that Sun is the Soul of our Peoples throughout History. And that Sun is God who blesses us and guides us in every Day and in every circumstance, to continue transcending and overcoming.</p>

<p>We also have, Compañer@s, a new Well in Las Enramadas here in Managua, serving 15,000 brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Then in Education, we have Infrastructure Projects and School Equipment in the "Rosa Virginia Pérez" school in La Paz, Carazo, an investment of 8 million.</p>

<p>In addition, we are also ensuring Property Titles, 650, in Boaco, this is Camoapa; Chontales, El Coral; Altagracia, Rivas, Ometepe Island, Moyogalpa, Ometepe Island, that natural heritage of Nicaragua, of the Nicaraguan People; Matagalpa, Diriamba, Jinotepe, Jinotega, Esteli, Nagarote, San Sebastián de Yali, San Juan de Limay. Families receiving their land deeds as owners of their plots or the sites where they live or work.</p>

<p>Public lighting has been delivered in Villa Venezuela, District VII, this afternoon. And the Energy Project in the Community of Bocana de Taiwa, in the Municipality of Río Blanco, opens today, serving 253 sisters and brothers.</p>

<p>So that’s how we are now, Compañer@s, as we said earlier, content and proud.  This afternoon, we are going to learn about the expansion of the norms governing this historic entity of our Nicaragua and our People, on the 49th Anniversary of the “Juan José Quezada” Commando, that Heroic Action of the “Juan José Quezada” Commando of the Sandinista Front.</p>

<p>Here we are, and there we will be, going from Epic to Epic, from Feat to Feat, always with the Courage, with the Honor and Glory of an Undefeated People, of a People that knows how to strive, a People that knows how to Overcome... We know how to Fight, we know how to Overcome!</p>

<p>Until later then, Compañeras and Compañeros, and Always Further On, as our General said. Always Further On is our Motto as we continue to build the Future we have all dreamed of and which we deserve so much.  warm embrace.</p>
