      <br>
Steadily improving financial and economic conditions through 2010 were
an important boost for people in Nicaragua and for the&nbsp; country's
Sandinista government. Despite the worldwide recession in 2009,
Nicaragua's
government protected the living standards of the most
impoverished.&nbsp; It is now well placed to continue making important
advances in poverty reduction and economic development through 2011. <br>
      <br>
The turnaround is partly due to the modest and patchy global recovery
from
the rich country financial crash of 2008. But perhaps more important
were the astute
and prudent domestic policies of the Sandinista government,
acknowledged even by
centrist economists who do not support the FSLN politically. Since
2007, Nicaragua's government has consolidated long standing trade
and development cooperation relationships with countries like Mexico,
Taiwan and Japan. <br>
      <br>
Despite political arm twisting from North America and
Europe, the FSLN government maintains relatively successful development
cooperation relationships with those two regions. In 2010, Nicaragua
played an important role in negotiating the much-criticized Agreement
of Association between the European Union and Central America. USAID
programs continue unaffected by the occasional spats between the
Nicaraguan and US authorities.<br>
      <br>
Alongside those traditional relationships, the Sandinista government
has also cultivated much closer diplomatic, trade and investment
relationships with other global
partners like Russia, Brazil and Iran. Membership of the Bolivarian
Alliance of the Americas (ALBA) has generated very important trade and
development cooperation links with Venezuela - now Nicaragua's second
largest export destination. Cuba's development cooperation has made
possible health programmes - like Misi&oacute;n Milagro or Todos con
Voz and the Yo S&iacute; Puedo literacy programme - that have benefited
hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans.<br>
      <br>
Within the Central American region, President Daniel Ortega's
government has withstood the many difficulties caused by the continuing
political and human rights crisis in Honduras and the aggressive
diplomatic offensive by Costa Rica over its spurious territorial claims
in relation to the Rio San Juan. Domestically, most of the political
opposition have abandoned their counterproductive policy of boycotting
institutions like the Supreme Court of Justice and the National
Assembly. In public opinion polls, President Daniel Ortega is well
ahead of his political rivals.<br>
      <br>
While in Nicaragua everyone is focused on the forthcoming presidential
elections in November 2011, the broader regional and global picture is
less well focused. Uncertainties abound. Global economic recovery is by
no
means guaranteed through 2011. Global security is under constant threat
from the&nbsp; militarism of the US government and its NATO allies and
those countries' support for Israel. Linked to the economic and
security
factors, global ecological stability is likely to deteriorate because
major industrial nations refuse to negotiate prudent measures to reduce
serious threats to the environment. <br>
      <br>
Military aggression overseas - structural adjustment at home<br>
      <br>
Unprecedented emergency financial measures taken by the US and European
Central Banks
and governments have&nbsp; rescued their financial systems from
bankruptcy. But they did so mostly by imposing the cost of the bailouts
on
ordinary citizens. The&nbsp;
banking sector rescues also dealt a fatal blow to the credibility of
"free market"
ideology. The
crisis of 2008 compressed the relative economic decline of
the European Union and the United States - self-evident from the
unproductive
finance orientation of their economies - reaching an epiphany in a
matter of months. <br>
      <br>
That epiphany was the recognition that the G-8 summit system had to
expand to a G-20 system to accommodate other economic powers. As a
result, giant countries like Brazil, China, India and Russia, as well
as lesser regional powers like Argentina, Indonesia, South Africa,
Turkey are becoming more important. It is noteworthy that Iran and
Venezuela
were excluded from the G-20 despite being as important in their
respective regions as countries
like Saudi Arabia and South Korea or Mexico.<br>
      <br>
To compensate for their relative decline in power and influence and
perhaps stave it off for a while,&nbsp; governments in North America
and Europe, and the oligarchies for which they front, are doing three
main things. Firstly, they are leveraging their massive military
power via aggressive wars and widespread low level global military
operations - increasingly, via the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Secondly, while protecting military spending and cosseting their
financial
cronies, they apply aggressive structural adjustment policies to their
own populations. Thirdly, as they undermine fundamental rights in their
own countries, they wage constant, vicious psychological warfare via
their loyal corporate media against people and governments who do not
do what they want.<br>
      <br>
These three phenomena occur in an economic context of stagflation that
is likely to last until the financial and political elites in North
America and Europe can create yet another
short-lived credit bubble, probably by 2016. People's incomes are
stagnant but they experience steadily rising prices and living costs.
Oil and food prices are likely to be volatile but to trend relentlessly
upwards. Unemployment will remain intractably high. All these
difficulties will probably be compounded by increasingly unpredictable
climate conditions.<br>
      <br>
The outcomes in North America and Europe of these political and
economic realities are unlikely to be stable. Every country in those
regions has already applied ever more oppressive security measures and
systems, ostensibly against terrorism. Those measures and systems are
available to be used mercilessly against domestic political resistance
to economic or environmental policies at home or to military aggression
overseas. The US government has already long abandoned any serious
claim it ever had to be a defender of basic human rights. Its NATO
partners are on the same track.<br>
      <br>
Latin America <br>
      <br>
As North America and Europe adapt brutally to their relative decline,
Latin America continues adapting to its relative progress over the last
decade. Every important country in the region has reached out to Asian
trading and investment partners, especially to China. In 2010, China
overtook the US as Brazil's most important trading partner. Since 2009
Argentina has engaged in currency swaps with China, eliminating the
dollar from much of the two countries' bilateral trade transactions.
India and Russia too have greatly increased their trade with and
investment in Latin America.<br>
      <br>
While Latin America's economic relations are generally diverse,
diplomatically,
the region is split three ways. Right wing governments like those in
Mexico, Per&uacute;, Colombia, Chile, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama
are unconditional allies of the United States government. Centrist
Central American governments in El Salvador and Guatemala, heavily
dependent on US trade and aid, struggle to define autonomous foreign
policy. Centre-left governments like those currently in office in the
Mercosur countries (Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil) maintain
cordial relations with the US but insist on their own priorities. <br>
      <br>
Examples of that insistence have been Argentina's determined and
successful efforts to defend its interests following the disastrous
economic debacle of 1999-2002 and Brazil's autonomous recent efforts to
broker
negotiations over Iran's right to nuclear power. Earlier, these
Mercosur
countries were also decisive in resisting the Bush regime's abortive
attempt to impose a Free Trade Area of the Americas. However, Brazil
also leads the discredited UN military occupation of Haiti and has
acted as a drag on the creation of economic integration initiatives
like the Banco del Sur. Brazil has preferred to emphasise the corporate
friendly South American Regional Infrastructure Integration Initiative
(IIRSA).<br>
      <br>
More radical steps towards sovereign autonomy characterize the ALBA
bloc of countries led by Venezuela and Cuba and including Bolivia,
Ecuador,&nbsp; Nicaragua and three Caribbean island nations. The ALBA
countries have moved ahead developing their own institutions, an
intra-bloc trade compensation system called the SUCRE, the ALBA Bank
and a structure of ALBA Councils that recalls the early days of the
European Economic Community. ALBA's implicit logic is one of opposition
to US and European dominance in Latin America.<br>
      <br>
That logic converges well with the medium and long term strategies of
the Mercosur countries and is not entirely incompatible with the trend
of US
allies in the region to diversify their trade and diplomatic relations.
But ALBA's regional redistributive logic does run counter to the&nbsp;
commitments and
understandings between centre-left governments in Brazil, Argentina and
Uruguay and those countries' corporate sectors. Brazil's corporate
elite in particular resists any concession of Brazil's regional
dominance in the name of greater regional equality. In that respect,
Brazil in
South America plays a similar role to that of France and Germany in the
European Union.<br>
      <br>
This means that regional political structures leading towards greater
integration will be subject to constant negotiation and compromise. The
Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was founded in 2008 and played
a key role in supporting President Evo Morales in Bolivia when the
US-supported right wing opposition made an all out attack on Morales'
government that same year. UNASUR will be joined on July 5th this year
by the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) - a
body rivalling the Organization of American States but excluding Canada
and the United States. The Banco del Sur
continues to struggle to be born as does the Council for South American
Defence. Negotiations in relation to these bodies turn on so many
factors as to make predictions as to outcomes impossible. <br>
      <br>
However, one key factor will be the extent to which the US government
pushes its destabilization efforts against the ALBA governments of
Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Even right-wing Latin
American governments
generally reject the coup in Honduras and the coup attempt in 2010 in
Ecuador. They know that they too are vulnerable and, in any case,
economic
considerations take priority. Colombia has made a
quick rapprochement with Venezuela following the departure of
vicious, narco-terrorist former president, Alvaro Uribe. US
destabilization
efforts are likely to shift towards greater support for Venezuela's
domestic opposition and likewise in other countries in the region
regarded as uncooperative. <br>
      <br>
Back to Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
In 2011, ALBA member Nicaragua is likely to prove a litmus test of US
government policy. The US government's&nbsp; regional allies will
continue seeking ways to undermine the unquestionable achievements of
successful governments in the ALBA countries. President Obama's
administration is adept at not having its right hand know what the left
hand is doing. The coup in Honduras and the attempted coup in Ecuador
were carried out&nbsp; and supported by committed supporters of US
dominance in the region inside and outside the US government while
leading US government figures looked the other way. <br>
      <br>
Whenever Under-Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo
Valenzuela speaks softly, it will be important to see what US
government democracy promotion/destabilization programs are doing and
what material the corporate media psy-warfare machine is producing.
Regionally,
the US Southern Command is now entrenched in Honduras, El Salvador and
Costa Rica with resources ridiculously far in excess of legitimate
anti-narcotics needs. After the events in Honduras and Ecuador, the
Nicaraguan government is carefully framing policy to counter attempts
by the US government and its regional allies to create adverse
conditions to obstruct the highly probable Sandinista electoral victory
in November 2011.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua has the most successful anti-narcotics record of any country
in Central America, despite receiving pitifully small levels of
assistance for that work from the United States government. Nicaragua
has been the
country most committed to regional integration processes in particular
the Central American Integration System (SICA). By contrast US allies
like Costa Rica and Panama have persistently undermined SICA's
viability. Nor has Nicaragua been&nbsp; unreasonable in its policy
towards the
regime of Pepe
Lobo in Honduras which the FSLN government, like most of Latin America,
refuses to
recognize because Pepe Lobo's election was held under the conditions of
a military coup.<br>
      <br>
If, as seems most likely, the Sandinista government is returned to
office in 2012 following a
successful presidential election for Daniel Ortega in November 2011,
the United States government's regional policy will have suffered a
decisive setback. Attention will then turn to the even more important
presidential elections in Venezuela in 2012. Should Hugo Chavez win in
2012 the United States government's remaining options to maintain
its&nbsp; traditional overweening regional influence will be
military&nbsp; ones. But if the Obama
administration does choose to use its unquestionable military muscle in
Latin America, it is likely to be a short term fix creating
unforeseeable reactions among economically powerful countries like
Brazil, Russia, and China which the US government can less and less
afford to alienate.<br>
