At the top of Dublin's O'Connell Street, the statue of Charles Stuart
Parnell stands on a plinth that bears part of his famous speech in
Cork of 1882 : "no man has the right to fix the boundary to the march
of
a nation. No man has a right to say to his country <i>'Thus far
shalt thou go and no farther'.</i> Maybe Hillary Clinton and
Barack Obama should put the&nbsp;Honduran pinochetti coup-mongers
on a plane at gunpoint so they can read that quote for themselves in their pyjamas.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
For their part, US&nbsp;oligarchs like Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obama seem incorrigibly wedded to the time honoured yankee neocolonial
fantasy that they can play
kingmakers in&nbsp;Latin America and the Caribbean for ever. With every false step they take, Barack Obama
and his foreign policy
team under Hillary Clinton increasingly
make the hopelessly inept Bush regime look
good.&nbsp;The latest&nbsp;folly&nbsp;has been
their propaganda account of Clinton "getting tough" with the brutal
coup regime in Honduras. <br>
<br>
Clinton is supposed to have telephoned&nbsp;de facto
regime&nbsp;gorilla-in-chief Roberto Micheletti to admonish him for
not sustaining Clinton's baby, the ill-fated dialogue mediated by Oscar
Arias in Costa Rica. That fake dialogue was doomed from the start
because it
was a deal imposed by the US with marked cards, de facto recognition of
the coup
leaders and rejection of constitutional change, and a crooked dealer,
Oscar Arias, sympathetic to the coup leaders. The one thing Clinton and
Arias could not change was the sine qua non of President Zelaya's
reinstatement. <br><br>That
non-negotiable condition was imposed by the Organization of American
States at the insistence of the Latin American governments led by the
ALBA countries. The US government has been desperate to stop Zelaya
returning to Honduras because,
once he does, it will be Zelaya who will have the initiative. In their
arrogance and hubris, US government officials did too little to secure
the fundamental aim
they share with the coup regime - a postponement of the urgent radical
change in Honduras necessary to achieve a just redistributive social
contract. Now it is too late.&nbsp;<br>
<br>It&nbsp;was probably always so, because, from
Day One of the coup, the only possible enduring resolution to the
constitutional crisis
in Honduras has been a Constituent Assembly. It will take unprecedented
political and diplomatic legerdemain to deny that epoch-making
political demand peacefully in the face of the mass non-violent
mobilization of grass roots
movements throughout Honduras. The next few days will most likely see
either some muddle-through, jury-rigged armistice or the outbreak of
serious civil conflict.<br><br>The
US government is certainly managing the coup in Honduras as part of an
aggressive revamp of overall regional strategic destabilization. By
establishing five new miltiary bases in Colombia they threaten
Venezuela and Ecuador, as well as staking out potential military
occupation of the Amazon. Something Brazil's armed forces have taken
for granted for years as the principal military threat to their
country's sovereignty. Right now Colombia is falsely accusing the
Ecuadoran government of supporting the FARC guerrilla movement in
Colombia's civil war, now decades old.<br><br>Honduras is being groomed
by the United States to play a similar destabilizing role in Central
America as Colombia does in the Andes. Marta Alvarado one of the de
facto pinochetti foreign affairs factotums in Tegucigalpa said outright
on July 20th "Honduras is playing a very important role in the sense
that it depends on Honduras whether the ALBA country landslide
continues and it also depends on Honduras whether the countries
suffering these pressures from the ALBA countries wake up." <br><br>This
is verbatim the counterfactual logic of the US State Department - that
ALBA, led by Venezuela, destabilizes the region. This US State
Department molly-coddled coup d'état, further needless militarization
of the Andes in Colombia, Plan Merida's drastic escalation of the
narcotics wars in Mexico - these, we are told, do not destabilize the
region. The US State Department wants people to believe that what
destabilizes the region are national literacy programmes, region-wide
health programmes, massive regional credit availability for small
businesses and agriculture, region wide energy and food security
programmes.<br><br>That ridiculous nonsense is the current basis of US
foreign policy in Latin America. The frauds that produce such stupid,
self-evidently deceitful pap are representatives of the same political
class fronting for the US oligarchy who, under the Bush regime lied,
cheated&nbsp;and deregulated the US economy into disaster. Now, under
peerless doubletalker Barack Obama, the same phonies are unleashing
their endless duplicity and idiocy on Latin America.<br><br>The fascist
Honduran oligarchs of today are backed by regional counterparts in
Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. For example, Eduardo Montealegre,
the&nbsp; US embassy's sweetheart candidate in Nicaraguan elections
since 2006,&nbsp;rejected Manuel Zelaya's latest remarks about his
imminent return to Honduras. Montealegre said on July 21st, "Nicaragua
cannot turn into a nest of terrorists or a space for insurrection. So I
therefore ask ex-President Zelaya to leave Nicaragua..."<br><br>The
mindset of these regional oligarchs has many similarities to that of
the wealthy sectarian Ulster bigots who,&nbsp;from the time of Parnell
onwards, doomed Ireland to war and abiding conflict. They are
determined to resist democratic change to benefit the impoverished
majority they have tormented for so long with wretched inhuman
immiseration. It is absolutely clear that the doubletalking Obama
administration is helping them to do so, despite the ominous threat of
prolonged conflict, perhaps civil war, that may again plunge Central
America into what had seemed unthinkable catastrophe.&nbsp;<br>
