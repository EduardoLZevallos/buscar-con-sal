after the Homage to Commander Thomas Borge,<br />
and Celebration of International Workers' Day<br />
<br />
April 30th 2020</strong></em></h3>

<p>Good evening, Compañer@s; good evening, dear families of our blessed, Christian Nicaragua, full of Solidarity. This Nicaragua is full of Love ! Love reigns here, because Jesus reigns forever! All this information Comandante Daniel has given us just now is a report of love, of the love that vibrates in our Nicaragua: love, service to others, love of others, as we love Jesus Christ our Lord.<br />
<br />
As a Christian people, as a people of faith, trust and hope, we proclaim always that our country is Christian and full of solidarity, and we are proud to say so not only in words, but also in deeds. To work according to Christian principles, Christian values, which are our culture.</p>

<p>We promote Love at all times, because it is stronger than Hate. Some people still, unfortunately, live in backwardness, in a mental bubble, a culture that is not the Nicaraguan culture. A generous, loving, fraternal people, that is our people and we live as a family, we live in community, and we reject, categorically, hatred or any negative feeling.<br />
Our Nicaragua is made of glory and vigour, and it is made for Humanity, so we, who know what it is to work every day, from morning to night, as our People work in the countryside and in the city, we proclaim continuously that Nicaragua is Christian and that Nicaragua belongs to Jesus, the Prince of Peace and Love!</p>

<p>There is no place for hatred... There is no place for self-importance, arrogance, in this Nicaragua. There is no room to believe that you are superior. Here we are all Nicaraguans and we are all family, and no one is better than another. The People teach us every day, and we learn from the People, from the courage, from the strength, precisely, of the Nicaraguan People, and we know a great deal about struggles, we understand what roads to take, we understand honor!</p>

<p>We feel proud of our working People, of our working Families, of our Teachers, of our Educators, of our health workers, of our Police, of our Army, of our Interior Ministry. Workers from all State institutions, from the municipal offices. We are proud of how and with what spirit we serve our People! Because we know that the People are the ones who are in charge, and we obey, proceed, work, seeking at all times, respect, dignity and well-being in our lives, in Peace, in harmonious coexistence, and in security.</p>

<p>With this report, our Comandante Daniel has given us a beautiful testimony of love, peace and security, because health is security, Life. And we know that Love always wins out, Love can do everything, along with Respect, because we must respect our families, our People. At times, a few outliers may even confuse some people into believing them, because they invent that someone may have this or that illness, and they confuse people, disrespecting privacy and the pain they cause.</p>

<p>And we wonder what our parents and relatives might say, for example, Don't they have a mother? Don't they know that we all belong to the next life, that we can move on to another plane of life at any time, and that we must respect and honor the grief of all our brothers and sisters who for one reason or another die in Nicaragua? But in their evil eagerness  to make mischief, now they say everyone dies of only one thing, when there are so many things people die of. What disrespect ! What a lack of Christian charity !</p>

<p>As our Commander Daniel said, when we promote or want to promote slogans or policies to make people to do what they cannot do in a country like Nicaragua, where we have to work and take care of ourselves, treating ourselves with love, but working so as to sustain Life. Because we do so in order to promote our health and to promote Life, and Life is also Work and Food, and everything that we require for our Homes and for our Families.</p>

<p>We know that we are overcoming the challenges. And we know that we have do so with Love. And we know that we are united in Hope. Because we trust in God, and because goodheartedness grows.</p>

<p>We were saying yesterday, when we were reading the Beatitudes... We are a good hearted People, a people of good hope, and we are convinced that all true Christians know this, because they too have good heart and good hope.</p>

<p>So, today, April 30th, we remember Tomás, we pay homage to his courage, to that intrepid spirit that always characterized him. We used to call him reckless, Tomás... But no! He was daring, audacious, always advancing, Tomás ! Here we are, Comandante advancing still, you are with us always, guiding, leading this Revolution that belongs to all of us!<br />
<br />
And tomorrow, May 1st, all of us Nicaraguans will be working one way or another, so to all of you our fraternal embrace. Work is our worthy laurel! We are a Working People, we are a People blessed with the spirit of labor, blessed with good instincts, so we know that God guides us along our ways, and that we follow them, in our Christian way, in solidarity, and not just in good but in great Heart, because we are full of Love.<br />
<br />
Here there is no room for hatred, or disrespect, or lies, or slander. There is no plague worse than Hate. Hate destroys even the People who suffer from it, because it is a disease, it is a plague. There is no plague worse than Hate, that is why we say, let us take care of our hearts, let us keep our hearts healthy, and always invoke God to strengthen those good instincts, and above all, Love, for Him, God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, and Love for our neighbor, because we are sisters and brothers, we are family, so let's move forward!<br />
<br />
Thank you, Compañer@s.</p>
