<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Libya, since antiquity, was always coveted by invaders and the only period of self-determination and stability that the country ever witnessed was the 42 years of the revolution that took place on the First of September 1969.</p>

<p>Without delving deep into history, Libya’s recent history could be traced to October 3, 1911, when the Italian troops landed at Tripoli under the pretext of protecting Italian citizens living in the country from the alleged threats of Muslim extremists. After more than 30 years of fierce resistance,  over 750 thousand Libyans died on the battlefield while tens of thousands died in exile on Italian islands.</p>

<p>Since it was occupied by Fascist Italy during World War II, Libya became a battleground between the Italians and Germans on one side, and the British, Americans and other Allies on the other side. World War II ended with the Allied forces’ control of Libya. As determined by the Allies, Libya came under the Allies’ administration, whereby the British military was in control of the regions of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania.  and Fezzan was controlled by the French army,  from 1942 until Libyan independence in 1951.</p>

<p>Although independent and overtly free from foreign control, the country remained politically run by British and American bases and embassies while the Italian settlers held the rein of the country’s economy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The First of September Revolution</strong></p>

<p>The revolution broke on the First of September, 1969, using <em>Jerusalem</em> as its secret code of action,  raising three vital mottoes: Freedom, Socialism and Unity. Freedom of the citizen, the country and drive to assist all peoples fighting to liberate themselves from colonialism.</p>

<p>To realize this at the local level, the main steps that were taken are as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Nationalization of Foreign Banks</em></p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">November 16, 1969 Libya takes over 51% of the capital of foreign banks.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Evacuation of Foreign Forces</em></p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">March 3rd, 1970 Libya evacuates the British forces and bases.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">June 11, 1970 the evacuation of American bases and forces.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">October 7th, 1970 evacuation of Italian settlers (around 25 thousand).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Nationalization of Oil Companies</em></p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:left;">On 7th December 1971 Libya issued a law nationalizing the assets of British Petroleum Exploration Company in Libya (in retaliation for Britain’s failure to prevent Iran from occupying the Arab Islands in the Arabian Gulf.)</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">On August the 11th, 1972 Libya imposed an agreement for a 51 per cent take over of the Occidental Oil Company in Libya.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">On August 16th, 1972 Continental, Amerada Hess and Marathon followed suit, but Shell refused to sign.</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">On September 1st, 1972 Libya announced the nationalization of 51 per cent of the assets of all oil companies operating in the country, including Esso Standard Oil Company, Mobil Oil Company Libya, Texaco Overseas, Asian Standard Oil Company of California, the Libyan American petroleum Company and British Dutch Shell Company.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Arab Dimension</strong></p>

<p>Having Jerusalem as its secret word of action, it is no wonder that the revolutionary government took steps to bolster the Palestinian Case politically, diplomatically, militarily and financially. The unity of the Arab Nation, as a means to achieve an upper hand in world affairs and to safeguard the sovereignty of the Nation, was also another goal that the Revolution spared no effort to realize. Several failed attempts in this regard,  and fruitless endeavors to establish the Arab Union,  led to Libya’s orientation towards Africa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The African Dimension</strong></p>

<p>In order to achieve freedom for Africa, Muammar Gaddafi pressured the African leaders to invigorate the Organization of African Unity,  and succeeded in turning it structurally into the African Union on September 9, 1999, hoping one day it would become the United States of Africa. Libya took the lead in financing several strategic projects to accelerate the process of consolidating the institutions of the Union including:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The African Satellite</em></p>

<p>In 1992, 45 African nations established RASCOM (Regional African Satellite Communication Organization) so that Africa would have its own satellite and slash communication costs in the continent. Africa at the time paid US$500 million fee to Europe for the use of its satellites like Intelsat for phone conversations, including those within the same country annually.</p>

<p>An African satellite only cost a onetime payment of US$400 million and the continent no longer had to pay a US$500 million annual lease After 14 years of vague promises from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the USA and Europe the Africans decided to go it alone. Libya put US$300 million on the table; the African Development Bank added US$50 million more and the West African Development Bank a further US$27 million – and that’s how Africa got its first communications satellite on December 26, 2007.</p>

<p>This cost the West, not just depriving it of US$500 million per year,  but the billions of dollars in debt and interest that the initial loan would generate for years to come, and in an exponential manner, thereby helping maintain an occult system in order to plunder the continent.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The African Monetary Fund, African Central Bank, African Investment Bank</em></p>

<p>Part of the Libyan funds frozen in the United States are the US$30 billion that belong to the Libyan Central Bank and had been earmarked as the Libyan contribution to three key projects which would add the finishing touches to,</p>

<ul>
	<li>the African federation</li>
	<li>the African Investment Bank in Sirte, Libya,</li>
	<li>the establishment in 2011 of the African Monetary Fund to be based in Yaoundé with a US$42 billion capital fund and,</li>
	<li>the Abuja-based African Central Bank in Nigeria which when it starts printing African money will ring the death knell for the CFA franc through which Paris has been able to maintain its hold on some African countries for the last fifty years.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The International Dimension</strong><br />
<br />
<em>The World Mathaba against Imperialism, Zionism, Racism and Reactionism</em></p>

<p>In 1982, Libya founded the World Mathaba Organization “World Center”, which provided moral, political, and military training to freedom-fighting movements in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Leaders of resistance movements in Africa who were members of this Organization became Presidents of their countries thanks to such assistance. President Nelson Mandela admits to Libya’s role in buttressing Africa’s fight for democracy. Witness, <em>“It was pure expediency to call on democratic South Africa to turn its back on Libya and Qaddafi, who had assisted us in obtaining democracy at a time when those who now made that call were the friends of the enemies of democracy in South Africa.”</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Italy’s Apology for Colonialization</strong></p>

<p>On the 1st of September 2008 Italy apologized for colonialization of Libya and agreed to pay 2.5 billion as compensation for 30 years of colonialization, hundreds of thousands of lives lost in the resistance war and tens of thousands who died in exile in Italian islands. Berlusconi said,<em> “This payment goes towards the tragic and dramatic moments of Italian occupation and for the deep wounds that have affected many Libyan families.”</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The U N Speech</strong></p>

<p>On Sep 23, 2009 in his address to the UN general assembly Gaddafi tore up a copy of the UN charter in front of startled delegates, accused the security council of being an al-Qaeda like terrorist body, called for George Bush and Tony Blair to be put on trial for the Iraq war, and demanded $7.7 trillion in compensation for the ravages of colonialism on Africa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The SATO</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, September 28th, 2009 during the Second Africa-South America Summit held over the weekend in Margarita island, Venezuela and which convened almost sixty leaders, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi proposed to create an organization that brings together the nations of South America and Africa.</p>

<p>He said the organization should be created immediately to provide a real platform in the South, which is similar to that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).<em> “This organization could become a South Atlantic Treaty Organization,</em>” he said.</p>

<p>The goal is that all nations could participate actively in the decision-taking procedure about their development and are not subject to unilateral decisions by NATO or the Security Council of the United Nations, explained Gaddafi.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Arab-NATO Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>The Third Africa-South America Summit was scheduled to convene in Libya in the month of September 2011, as Libyan diplomats in the two regions we were certain that SATO would be announced in that summit. This, according to NATO, was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Gaddafi cannot be trusted and should not be given the opportunity to revive the dream that had been nipped in the bud tens of years ago. And as the saying goes in Arabic: NATO had Gaddafi for lunch before he had <em>it </em>for dinner.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Libyan Predicament</strong></p>

<p>Following is an objective evaluation of how Libya was during the Jamahiri system and what it has become under the current no-system. The following two judgements come from the highest echelons of two of the most prominent members of NATO, Britain and the United States of America.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Libya in 2010 (British Official Evaluation)</strong></p>

<p>On Sep 14, 2016 the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee on examining the intervention and collapse and the UK’s future policy options gave the following evaluation of Libya before the crisis:</p>

<p>The Libyan economy generated some $75 billion of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. This economy produced an average annual per capita income of approximately $12,250, which was comparable to the average income in some European countries.</p>

<p>Libyan Government revenue greatly exceeded expenditure in the 2000s. This surplus revenue was invested in a sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which was conservatively valued at $53 billion in June 2010.11.</p>

<p>The United Nations Human Development Report 2010—a United Nations aggregate measure of health, education and income—ranked Libya as the 53rd most advanced country in the world for human development and as the most advanced country in Africa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Libya After 7 Years of the NATO Aggression: (American Evaluation)</strong></p>

<p>On April 18, 2018 a hearing before the subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs House of Representatives of the US Congress on the state of Libya 7 years after the NATO war on the country came to the following conclusion:</p>

<p>Nearly 7 years after Qaddafi’s removal, Libya remains mired in civil conflict, political division, lawlessness, and economic crisis, with few signs of abating anytime soon. ISIS and al-Qaeda, though seriously degraded, are regrouping, and as we have seen in a series of car bombings this year, they are still very much capable of violence. Despite backing by the United Nations and its partners, the western-based Government of National Accord, or GNA, has not been able to provide security or consolidate power throughout Libya’s vast territory, and it continues to clash with eastern-based House of Representatives backed by General Haftar and his Libyan National Army, or LNA.</p>

<p>Armed militias, some with ties to the LNA and GNA, profit off the lack of security and the rule of law, smuggling drugs, weapons and people, and migrants using Libya as a way-point into Europe, suffer horrific treatment at the hands of smugglers, including torture, sexual abuse, and enslavement.</p>

<p>Adding to the chaos, a host of external actors continue to back different Libyan factions with the U.S. and the U.N. supporting the GNA; Egypt, the UAE, and Russia supporting Haftar, and Qatar and Turkey supporting the country’s Islamist groups. And as we saw when three French soldiers were killed fighting ISIS alongside Haftar forces in 2016, even France has played both sides, sometimes assisting the U.S. and the GNA while at other times supporting Haftar and his factions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In one of his lectures titled “Imperialism and Void [Vacuum],” Muammar Gaddafi stated that imperialism never dies, and it will return once its conditions are ripe. The “Arab Spring” was the culmination of years of think-tank political conferences and carefully planned strategies to silence the man who said no to imperialistic whims to control the world.  Libya today is a backward country, its citizens are again accepting charity from abroad, its economy is on the verge of collapse, it is back under the protection of the United Nations and the superpowers who are awaiting the right moment to attack the prey with the United States, Britain, Italy and France vying for the control of the tripartite country as they had done at the end of the Second World War.</p>
