<div style="text-align: justify;">On September 16
Nicaraguan statesman Father Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/ga.html">assumed
the presidency of the 63rd session of the General Assembly</a> of the
United
Nations. Tortilla con Sal takes a look at his personal and political
background
and his proposed agenda for the Assembly during the coming year. <br>
<br>
Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann, President of the 63rd session of the United
Nations
(UN) General Assembly, is a Nicaraguan diplomat and politician as well
as a
Catholic Priest with the Maryknoll order. Born on February 5th 1933 in
Los
Angeles, California, D'Escoto moved to Nicaragua at the age of three
where he
spent the rest of his childhood. In 1962 he was ordained as a Roman
Catholic
Priest for the Maryknoll congregation. Maryknoll, or the Catholic
Foreign
Mission Society of America, is a U.S. Catholic Society of Apostolic
Life which
focuses on missionary work overseas. <br>
<br>
In 1970 D'Escoto co-founded Orbis Books while working at the
Maryknoll&#8217;s Social
Communications Department in New York. Orbis Books is the publishing
arm of the
Maryknoll congregation. Shortly after its founding Orbis Books rapidly
became an
influential publisher of books on Liberation Theology and other themes.
On its
website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.orbisbooks.com/">Orbis
Books</a> describes its
main objective as being "to address a broad readership exploring the
global
dimensions of faith, inviting dialogue with diverse cultures and
traditions and
serving the cause of reconciliation and peace."
<br>
<br>
During his community and religious work in Managua in the 1970s
D'Escoto became
a supporter of the FSLN (the Sandinista Front for National Liberation)
which was
involved in an armed insurrection with the aim of overthrowing military
Dictator
Anastasio Somoza whose government was being propped up with excessive
US
support. D'Escoto first made his sympathy with the FSLN's political
objectives
public when he co-founded a group of twelve prominent Nicaraguan
intellectuals,
businessmen, lawyers and clergies, known as Los Doce. The group issued
a public
statement of support for the FSLN in 1977. This communique lead to
widespread
acceptance of the FSLN both within Nicaragua and by the international
community. <br>
<br>
After Somoza was overthrown in 1979 D'Escoto was appointed Minister of
Foreign
Affairs, a position he held until 1990 when the FSLN lost the
presidential
election. During his time as Foreign Minister D'Escoto played a key
role in the
Contadora and Esquipulas peace processes which brought an end to the
armed
conflicts in Central America in the 1980s. In recognition of D'Escoto's
efforts to
bring peace to Nicaragua and the Central American region he has been
awarded
several international acknowledgments including the International Lenin
Peace
Prize (1985 - 6), the Thomas Merton Prize (1987), the Julio Cortázar
Prize for
Peace and Democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean (1985) and the
Alfonso
Comín Peace Prize (1984).<br>
<br>
Also during his time as Foreign Minister D'Escoto lead the Nicaraguan
government's claim against the US for its support of Contra troops at
the
International Court of Justice. In 1987 the International Court ruled
in favor
of Nicaragua ordering the US to pay US$17 billion in compensation for
the
damages inflicted on the Nicaraguan people. To this day, however, the
US has not
honoured the international court ruling. <br>
<br>
D'Escoto has remained faithful in his support of the historic FSLN
leader (and
current Nicaraguan President), Daniel Ortega, rejecting the political
objectives
of the faction led by the MRS (Sandinista Renovation Movement) which
split from
the FSLN at the beginning of the 1990s.<br>
<br>
Currently D'Escoto is Senior Advisor on Foreign Affairs to Nicaraguan
President
Ortega. He also presides the National Committee on Water for Nicaragua,
which
seeks to preserve the country's fresh water sources including Lake
Cocibolca,
the largest body of water in Mesoamerica. <br>
<br>
In the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/president/63/presskit/president.shtml">biography
provided by the UN</a>
for the President of the 63rd session of the General Assembly, D'Escoto
is
described as having been "inspired by the lives and works of such
personalities
as Leo Tolstoy, M.K. Ghandi, Dr. Martin Luther King and Dorothy Day."
It goes
on, "Father D'Escoto is an advocate of multilateralism and respect for
international law. He is deeply committed to the principals of active
non-violence, solidarity and social justice, which together with a deep
sense of
ethics, have formed the basis of his political life." <br>
<br>
Since being elected President of the 63rd session of the UN General
Assembly
D'Escoto has emphasized his intention to support and promote proposals
to
"democratize" the international organization. During <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/president/63/statements/acceptspeech.shtml">his
acceptance speech</a>&nbsp; to the Assembly
on June 4 of this year he said: <br>
<br>
"The United Nations still has a lot to contribute to the world.
However, in order
to do so effectively, it must be precisely what its name implies: an
organization of united nations, not an organization of nations in
disarray, much
less one of subjugated nations. Unity based on the principle of the
sovereign
equality of all its Members is currently the greatest demand placed on
the
Organization - unity in the struggle to democratize the United Nations
and unity
in the effort to preserve the world and all manifestations of life
within it,
for the sake of present and future generations, from the scourge of war
between
Member States and acts of aggression such as those occurring in Iraq
and
Afghanistan. ... Rest assured ... that during the sixty-third session
of the
General Assembly, we will follow [President of the 62nd General
Assembly, H.E.
Srgjan Kerim's] dynamic example by giving all of our support to the
Working
Group on the revitalization of this Assembly, and we will endeavour to
strengthen [the Assembly's] role, its efficacy and its efficiency,
reaffirming
the leadership role assigned to it by the Charter."<br>
<br>
In a recent <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ONU/ultima/esperanza/elpepuint/%2020080911elpepuint_7/Tes">interview
with El Pais</a> journalist Sandro Pozzi D'Escoto spoke at
length about the urgent need for reforms within the UN. "It is
unacceptable that
resolutions by the Assembly, which is constituted by representatives of
the
peoples [of the world], are considered no more than recommendations and
are
totally ignored. ... The UN is potentially the most important
organization in
the world and the only [organization] that can save the planet from the
morass
of demented selfishness in which we find ourselves and get us on track
to
building a better [world]." <br>
<br>
Since his election, D'Escoto has made no secret of his objection to the
exclusive privileges of veto and permanence enjoyed by the five
permanent
members of the UN's Security Council (the US, the UK, China, Russia and
France).
Speaking about the specific proposals of reform for the Security
Council during
the same interview he said: <br>
<br>
"[The proposals] are mainly to do with finding a balance in
geographical
representation and whether new members should be given permanent
membership with
the right to veto [resolutions]. But those do not go far enough. The
worst thing
[about the way the Security Council operates] is that is has become a
refuge for
those [nations] that systematically violate the UN charter with total
impunity.
If this is the part of the UN that is supposed to avoid wars and
guarantee
stability, [then] how is it possible that it perpetuates some of the
worst
anomalies? At the UN there is an unwritten rule which is widely
respected; that
nothing should be said which incommodes the powerful [nations]."<br>
<br>
D'Escoto considers global perception of the UN to be at the worst
moment of the
organization's history due mainly to its "inability to call [the US] to
order."
Comments like these have provoked criticism of the new Assembly
President by
representatives of rich nations. After D'Escoto's acceptance speech, spokesman
for the
US permanent mission to the UN, Richard Grenell, said "the president of
the
General Assembly is supposed to be a uniter. We have made it clear that
these
crazy comments are not acceptable, and we hope he refrains from this
talk and
gets to work on General Assembly business." (1)<br>
<br>
Another of the reforms D'Escoto would like to bring into effect during
his one
year presidency is a mechanism by which the UN Economic and Social
Council
(ECOSOC) exercises greater control over international financial
institutions
like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank which
were created
by the UN. According to D'Escoto these institutions tend to "blackmail'
impoverished countries into accepting economic policies which turn out
to be
"lethal" for the countries' social and economic development. <br>
<br>
In a <a href="http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/efe/20080913/twl-el-nicaraguense-d-escoto-asumira-%20la-e1e34ad.html">recent
interview with EFE</a> D'Escoto acknowledges that reforming the
UN is a "gigantic
task" but believes there is "a new sense of urgency among member
countries" to
consolidate the democratic structures of the international
organization. One of
the most important changes that must take place in the short term, said
D'Escoto, is to rid the minds of certain&nbsp;member country representatives
of "the
idea that they can evade UN regulations as happened during the Iraq
invasion.
... There are some [countries] that do not want peace, what they want
is control
over the planet, but imperial dreams and ambitions will never bring
peace." <br>
<br>
Father D'Escoto's first important task as President of the General
Assembly will
be to coordinate the annual general debate. This debate, which will
begin on
September 23 and last for eight days, will include the participation of
dozens
of Heads of State and Government as well as Ministers. The overarching
theme of
the debate, proposed by D'Escoto will be "The impact of the global food
crisis
on poverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to democratize
the United
Nations." <br>
<br>
D'Escoto and his team have set out the key issues to be discussed by
the
Assembly during the 63rd session as follows:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Democratization of the United Nations, including
evaluations of the work
of the Security Council and of the Bretton Woods institutions, as well
as
revitalization of the General Assembly;
</li>
<li>Financing for development to end hunger, poverty and
lack of access to
clean water and basic health services;
</li>
<li>Climate change in a divided but ecologically
interdependent world;
</li>
<li>Achieving the goals of the United Nations Decade:
&#8220;Water for Life&#8221;
(2005-2015);
</li>
<li>Implementation of the Counter-Terrorism Strategy,
with full respect for
human rights;
</li>
<li>Human security as a part of international peace and
security, including
disarmament and nuclear control. (2)</li>
</ul>
