      <br>
To answer the question why the United States stumbles from one foreign
policy disaster to another, one has only to consider the disinformation
its intellectual classes feed into public policy debate. Latin American
intellectuals from Rodó to Retamar have used motifs from Shakespeare's
Tempest to frame discussion of Latin America's identity in relation to
Europe and the United States. Following their example, the motif of
purposeful enchantment confounding people's ability to discern fact
from narcissistic, self-serving and often downright dishonest fantasy
sits well when it comes to the neocolonial propaganda output of US NGOs
like the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA).<br>
      <br>
On August 13th this year, COHA published the article &#8220;Nicaragua &amp;
ALBANISA: The Privatization of Venezuelan Aid&#8221; by their research
associate Brendan Riley. The article purports to be an independent
analysis of Venezuelan development cooperation to Nicaragua under the
ALBA framework. But, relying on mendacious, disingenuous Nicaraguan
media reports, it gives an erroneous and inaccurate account of the way
ALBA's programs in Nicaragua work. On the basis of that failure Riley
then offers tendentious moral-political judgements in line with the
standard US State Department themes taken up constantly by the
internally discredited Nicaraguan opposition, namely corruption,
democracy and good governance. <br>
      <br>
COHA, CINCO , Dyncorp<br>
      <br>
The whole article is self-evidently cribbed directly &#8211; complete with
identical innuendo and factual mistakes - from sources in the US funded
Nicaraguan opposition. The very title of Brendan Riley's article is one
used also by Carlos Fernando Chamorro, unscrupulous self-promoting
scion of Nicaragua's oligarchic Chamorro family. The Chamorros enjoy a
virtual monopoly of Nicaragua's Press media through their ownership of
the &#8220;El Nuevo Diario&#8221;, &#8220;La Prensa&#8221; and &#8220;Hoy&#8221; newspapers. Chamorro uses
a literal Spanish translation of the title of COHA's article in a
Nicaraguan opposition slideshow at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/COLPIN/la-privatizacin-de-la-cooperacin-venezolana-en-nicarag-ua-5158876">this URL</a>. <br>
      <br>
The obvious conclusion is that COHA worked closely with Carlos Fernando
Chamorro in recent months to produce a coordinated propaganda attack on
ALBA, specifically ALBA in Nicaragua. COHA produced a propaganda piece
in English written by Riley. Chamorro, director of the USAID and
Dyncorp supported CINCO media NGO in Nicaragua, produced the slideshow
presentation in Spanish. Both pieces of propaganda use the same
material, making the same arguments and sharing the same factual
mistakes. <br>
      <br>
Carlos Chamorro's CINCO NGO operates as an umbrella for various smaller
organizations associated directly with his family and political
cronies. CINCO willingly accepts support from the notorious Dyncorp
private military contractor to the US government via the
Camtransparencia program. COHA's collaboration with CINCO via its
attack piece on ALBA in Nicaragua consolidates the disinformation
feedback cycle that starts from the US State Department.&nbsp; In line
with US government propaganda themes, US allies in the local political
opposition and their media outlets in Nicaragua, then feed
disinformation and downright untruth into the international corporate
media (Wall Street Journal, McClatchy News, the New York Times and
their foreign counterparts). <br>
      <br>
COHA's disinformation article on ALBA in Nicaragua reveals how deep the
collusion goes between the rich country progressive managerial classes
that control intellectual production for their sector of international
opinion and foreign NGOs funded by US government sub-contractors like
Dyncorp. What the State Department's strategists have achieved with
this subtle breakthrough is a kind of organic osmotic networking to
feed their message into rich country liberal and progressive
information NGOs, think tanks and web sites. Those organization's
intellectual production then flows into the mainstream corporate
disinformation directed back into the Central American region&nbsp; as
&#8220;news&#8221; or &#8220;independent analysis&#8221; to reinforce the local propaganda
onslaught against, in this case, Nicaragua's Sandinista-led government.
The technique is the very same everywhere else in Latin America.<br>
      <br>
This means that when supposedly radical web sites publish
anti-Sandinista propaganda like, for example, Roger Burbach's article
in early 2009 for NACLA or COHA's anti-FSLN article by Brendan Riley,
they are integrating themselves into a disinformation process designed
in the US State Department with support from powerful subcontractors
like Dyncorp and other similar multinational corporations. That should
come as no surprise to anyone sceptical of the role of the progressive
managerial classes that control intellectual production in North
America and the countries of the European Union.<br>
      <br>
In any case, the subservience to broad State Department propaganda
requirements of COHA - and other similar organizations like the
Washington Office on Latin American Affairs or Inter-American Dialogue
- could not be clearer. They all operate from the absurd Americanist
propaganda premise that the United States offers legitimate global
benchmarks for democracy, justice, human rights and good governance in
general. The words of Malcolm X to an audience in Accra forty five
years ago still echo loud and clear :<br>
      <br>
&#8220;...I just try to face the fact as it actually is and come to this
meeting as one of the victims of America, one of the victims of
Americanism, one of the victims of democracy, one of the victims of a
very hypocritical system that is going all over this earth today
representing itself as being qualified to tell other people how to run
their country when they can&#8217;t get the dirty things that are going on in
their own country straightened out. &#8220;<br>
      <br>
Facts about ALBA in Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
In summary, the facts about ALBA in Nicaragua are straightforward. In
2006, Venezuela began assisting Nicaragua with fuel and oil derivatives
on preferential terms. The original agreement was between the
Sandinista-led Nicaraguan Association of Municipalities and a
subsidiary of Venezuela's State oil company PDVSA. When the Frente
Sandinista de Liberación Nacional took office in 2007, a more
far-reaching agreement was signed between PDVSA and Nicaragua's State
oil company Petronic. That agreement was superseded through 2007 and
2008 with the formation of a joint venture company ALBANISA,
majority-held by PDVSA with Petronic as the minority partner. <br>
      <br>
All these agreements have operated within the framework of Petrocaribe
which is made up of 19 countries in Central America and the Caribbean.
The standard agreement under Petrocaribe is for member countries to
receive a given amount of Venezuelan oil, fuel and other oil
derivatives of which 50% is paid within 90 days and 50% paid over 20
years with highly preferential interest rates of as little as 2%. The
agreements usually stipulate that the 50% to be repaid over 20 years
should be used for social investment programs via entities approved by
PDVSA and the ALBA Social Fund.<br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua, because the opposition political parties are so hostile
to the Venezuelan government, those agreements have never been via the
Nicaraguan State but through private-sector companies ultimately
controlled by PDVSA. Both COHA and CINCO argue that the funds are
public. But they are not. Both COHA and CINCO argue the funds are
ultimately controlled by Daniel Ortega and his family circle. That is
completely false also. The funds are ultimately controlled by PDVSA and
other ALBA institutions like BANDES, Venezuela's development bank. <br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua, 50% of the price of oil, fuel and other oil derivatives
due to PDVSA is split into 25% to be managed directly by a national
savings cooperative called CARUNA and 25% to be supervised by the ALBA
Social Fund, also through CARUNA. Riley gets this flat out wrong,
insisting, incorrectly, that ALBANISA directly administers one of those
two blocks of social investment funds. That is not the case, as
officials of both ALBANISA and CARUNA have made clear in interviews
readily accessible on the web (via a simple search for &#8220;nicaragua
entrevista francisco lopez albanisa&#8221; or &#8220;nicaragua entrevista alba
caruna&#8221;). COHA prefers to cite dishonest opposition glosses over the
factual account available from officials of the organizations concerned.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Repayments under the Petrocaribe and ALBA frameworks can be made in
kind with, for example, agricultural produce, a barter arrangement
effectively reducing the role of US dollars in intra-regional trade. In
recent years, Petrocaribe has extended its remit to assist with food
security. That has been especially important for member countries which
experienced great difficulties during 2008 when oil and food prices
spiked dramatically higher, prior to the collapse of the US and
European financial system later that year. <br>
      <br>
More ambitious than Petrocaribe, the ALBA framework currently has eight
member countries. ALBA includes far-reaching economic, social,
cultural, educational, technical and scientific components. ALBA's
literacy programmes have dramatically reduced illiteracy in Nicaragua,
Venezuela and Bolivia. Its health care programs, like Misión Milagro,
and numerous ALBA-funded Cuban medical brigades have made possible
previously inaccessible health care for millions of people in the
region. <br>
      <br>
ALBA supplements the social investment resources derived from
Petrocaribe with low interest credits from Venezuela's National
Development Bank and other funding that has become available as ALBA
has developed. As part of the ALBA framework, PDVSA and its
subsidiaries help set up intra-regional companies to engage in
commercial operations across various sectors, from oil refinery
construction and petrochemical facilities to agribusiness and
pharmaceuticals. ALBA has also established its own regional development
bank and the SUCRE clearing system of compensation payments freeing
countries and companies from the need to conduct intra-regional
commercial transactions in foreign currency.<br>
      <br>
COHA's factual inaccuracies<br>
      <br>
In that context, the COHA article gets things factually wrong right
from the start. Contrary to Brendan Riley's account, FSLN leader Daniel
Ortega had made clear his intention to incorporate Nicaragua into
Petrocaribe and ALBA months before he took office as President in
January 2007. ALBA's extensive practical operations are far from
&#8220;symbolic opposition to the free trade agreements&#8221;. It is insanely
counterfactual to suggest, as COHA's article does, that ALBA suffers
from a &#8220;a lack of concrete results&#8221;. Support from ALBA made it possible
within twelve months to eliminate the 12 hour power cuts that had
become a routine daily feature in Nicaragua under the previous
incompetent neoliberal Bolaños administration. Nicaragua has already
met several of the UN Millenium Development Goals thanks directly to
ALBA.<br>
      <br>
COHA's article attempts to suggest that ALBA's role in promoting
Nicaragua's economic development is somehow compromised by Nicaragua's
membership of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. But the FSLN
has always advocated a mixed economy ever since its participation in
the National Reconstruction Government. President Hugo Chavez too has
repeatedly acknowledged the importance of a mixed economy for
Venezuela. Contrary to false Nicaraguan opposition propaganda, the FSLN
did oppose CAFTA on the terms imposed by then US Trade Representative
Robert Zoellick and his team. But they do not necessarily oppose trade
agreements as such.<br>
      <br>
Despite those facts, Riley writes &#8220;Nicaragua&#8217;s simultaneous membership
in the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) suggests that ALBA
does not quite play the revolutionary role to which its proponents
initially aspired.&#8221; In writing that, Riley is merely reassuring his
North American audience that he too is suitably sceptical of ALBA's
achievements and its radical region-changing logic.&nbsp; His
irrelevant posturing contradicts Riley's own contention that &#8220;ALBA has
proved a destabilizing force in an already polarized political
environment.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
So, in one paragraph Riley suggests that ALBA probably has very little
impact and really is not especially radical. Then, in the next
paragraph, we find ALBA is in fact a very real force and one that is
&#8220;destabilizing&#8221;, an adjective copied straight out of the US State
Department regional screenplay. Riley immediately goes on to
demonstrate he has completely failed to ascertain the facts about how
ALBA's programmes are implemented in Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
He writes, &#8220;Venezuelan cooperation through ALBA led to the creation of
a private company called ALBANISA (ALBA de Nicaragua, S.A) to manage
the anticipated investment funds.&#8221; This is completely incorrect.
ALBANISA's contractual agreement with PDVSA stipulates that ALBANISA
has to pay the 50% of payments (due for oil and oil derivatives
provided by PDVSA) assigned to social investment funds in two 25%
tranches to management entities specified by PDVSA. In fact, for both
the 25% social investment components, the PDVSA approved management
entity in Nicaragua is the national savings cooperative Caja Rural
Nacional R.L. (CARUNA)<br>
      <br>
There is no excuse for Riley's crass error of fact. Interviews with the
relevant officials of ALBANISA and CARUNA are readily accessible in
both English and Spanish. COHA's article misleads its readers as to the
basic facts of how ALBA works in Nicaragua by stating incorrectly that
a private commercial company is responsible for managing large social
investment funds. Riley compounds that factual error by clearly arguing
the funds are managed without adequate oversight. That is not true
either. Riley's article on this issue is based on false Nicaraguan
opposition propaganda rendered into digestible disinformation via
COHA's Americanist baloney machine.<br>
      <br>
Institutional controls<br>
      <br>
Out beyond Riley's fact-free baloney-feast, the regulatory framework in
which ALBA's development cooperation programmes work in Nicaragua
operate conforms to standard practice in countries around the world.
ALBANISA and its subsidiaries as private commercial companies are all
subject to Nicaraguan company law and obliged to comply with the
relevant tax, customs and excise, employment law and other obligations
as well as satisfying reporting requirements to Nicaragua's Companies
Register. This general institutional framework also applies to various
other companies set up by ALBANISA, mostly in the energy and transport
sector.<br>
      <br>
ALBANISA's minority shareholder Petronic is subject to periodic audit
by Nicaragua's Comptroller General's office. It was subject to such
audit in the first semester of 2010 &#8211; an audit, which according to one
of Nicaragua's State auditors in a presentation to journalists, made
only minor technical recommendations. ALBANISA itself may be subject to
audit in future, depending on a determination yet to be made by the
relevant authorities. ALBANISA and Petronic report occasionally to the
Economic Committee of Nicaragua's National Assembly and have also
provided information to the IMF. <br>
      <br>
CARUNA, as well as having to file reports with the national Tax Office
and the National Cooperative Institute, is also overseen by Nicaragua's
bank and financial institutions supervisory body. Apart from managing
ALBA's social investment funds, CARUNA, as it has done for many years,
also manages very large funds of other foreign aid and development
cooperation organizations. As well as reporting to the various relevant
State insitutions, CARUNA has to report both internally to its members
and externally to the entities on whose behalf it manages funds. In the
case of the ALBA funds it is obliged to report to PDVSA and other ALBA
entities like the Venezuelan Development Bank, BANDES.<br>
      <br>
In addition to this institutional framework regulating the operations
of ALBANISA, other ALBA companies and CARUNA, the ALBA framework itself
has planning and evaluation structures to ensure adequate use of ALBA's
resources. ALBA has developed similar kinds of planning, policy and
evaluation stuctures to those developed by the European Economic
Community before that regional body turned into the European Union.
ALBA bodies like the Economic Council, the Social Council, the
Political Council and others exercise an effective supervisory role
over the use of funds.<br>
      <br>
This is the overall commercial and institutional context in which
ALBANISA and its subsidiary companies operate. Opposition corporate
media in Nicaragua have tried desperately to portray ALBA's
arrangements as a web of corruption to benefit the family clique of
President Daniel Ortega. Their fake reports rely overwhelmingly on
innuendo they would never apply to the private companies of political
allies like the Chamorro family itself or of Eduardo Montealegre,
currently indicted for massive fraud of public funds. COHA has joined
the hypocritical Nicaraguan opposition chorus.<br>
      <br>
COHA/CINCO double act<br>
      <br>
The double-standards are particularly apparent when it comes to Carlos
Chamorro's personal fiefdom, the CINCO mutant media octopus-tit
squirting out succour to Chamorro's family, friends and political
associates like women's activist Sofia Montenegro. Over the years
CINCO's resources have derived from various sources including USAID,
countries of the European Union and intermediaries including European
NGOs and US corporations like Dyncorp, currently via the USAID funded
Camtransparencia programme. Self evidently, those entities support
CINCO on political criteria to strengthen the centre-right
corporate-friendly Nicaraguan opposition of which CINCO board members
like Carlos Chamorro and Sofia Montenegro are leading actors.<br>
      <br>
COHA/CINCO's combined assault on ALBA in Nicaragua depends on downright
misreporting, falsely claiming that the ALBA funds are ultimately
corruptly managed in an entirely discretional way by Daniel Ortega and
his family. In fact, the resources derived from ALBA have to be
accounted for to their sources in ALBA's steadily developing
institutions, PDVSA, BANDES, the various ALBA Councils, the ALBA Bank.
What COHA/CINCO seem to be complaining about is that the corrupt
politicians whom they prefer &#8211; whose shameful record has been damningly
recorded by Nicaragua's State audit body - cannot get their own corrupt
hands on ALBA's resources.<br>
      <br>
The local media assault &#8211; led by the centre right Chamorro family's
press monopoly &#8211; amounts to little more than local oligarchs tearing
their garments and gnashing their teeth at being unable to crush a
dynamic challenge to their accustomed economic dominance and that of
their foreign corporate masters. They hate ALBA because it renders them
irrelevant. The local media assault in Nicaragua feeds the infinite
disinformation feedback loop in North America, across the political
spectrum from the Wall Street Journal and McClatchy News to
Counterpunch and Znet. <br>
      <br>
COHA's article helps complete the disinformation feedback loop by
adding the questionable prestige of North America's intellectual
classes to the bogus arguments of tendentious political players like
Carlos Chamorro and his clique. For example, COHA's Riley writes :
&#8220;Opposition members allege that the Ortega government has been
embezzling these funds. Although this accusation remains difficult to
prove, the state must acknowledge what could be the legitimate fears
and suspicions of the public. Therefore, it should begin by including
these funds in the national budget.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Riley's neocolonial cant begs the question of why Nicaragua should be
urged to have incomparably higher standards than the United States with
regard to private entities involved in financial relations with the
State. The day Congress audits the Federal Reserve, Riley might begin
to have a plausible case. Until then, it is reasonable to apply the
same criteria to Nicaragua as those that apply in the US. Nicaragua's
company law is probably more robust than the woeful US crony regulatory
framework. There, for example, the Federal Accounting Standards Board
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation cut crony-capitalist
backroom deals with corporate financial institutions enabling them to
keep multi-billion dollar liabilities off their balance sheets so as to
be able to continue paying out massive bonuses to incompetent
executives.<br>
      <br>
COHA and Brendan Riley would have more credibility taking on the issue
of corruption in Nicaragua if they paid equal attention, for example,
to corruption involving opposition politicians and their families and
supporters, or to the history under Nicaragua's neoliberal governments
of egregious cosy tax holidays enjoyed by corporations like ESSO
brought to light under the Sandinista government. The Chamorro family's
media empire vehemently supported ESSO in that dispute.&nbsp; Now they
hypocritically team up with COHA attempting, without success, to pin
corruption on the FSLN government led by Daniel Ortega.<br>
      <br>
In fact, there was a corruption case involving ALBANISA which was dealt
with by the Nicaraguan courts and documented by auditors from
PDVSA.&nbsp; Even Riley takes note of it. But still manages to get the
facts wrong. The case involved a relatively minor fraud involving
around US$70,000. Auditors from PDVSA documented the fraud. The case
went to court. The episode makes all the previous allegations of
corruption at the highest levels and lack of oversight look ridiculous.
      <br>
      <br>
Riley alleges that the PDVSA auditors' report found &#8220;some 1.4 million
córdobas (nearly US $70,000 of ALBANISA funds) had gone unaccounted
for, though unofficial sources claim the figure could be much greater.
As a result of the report, López Centeno was removed from his
position.&#8221; Firstly, it is completely gratuitous innuendo to note
baseless speculation by unattributed &#8220;unofficial sources&#8221;. Secondly,
Francisco López was never dismissed from his position as Vice-President
of Albanisa. Ever. Riley is completely misinformed because he has
swallowed the jaundiced reports of his soulmates in the Nicaraguan
opposition media without checking them.<br>
      <br>
Both Riley as the COHA dummy and Carlos Chamorro, his CINCO
ventriloquist, use innuendo, factual error and the exaggeration of
trivia to build their nonexistent case against ALBANISA and ALBA. But
Riley spouts a special line in crocodile tears about the polarization
of Nicaraguan politics, failing to note that the opposition should in
theory enjoy a walkover in the National Assembly because the FSLN
party, while controlling the Executive, only have 38 of the
legislature's 92 seats. <br>
      <br>
Even so, the Nicaraguan opposition have dismally failed to act
purposefully to use that majority to their advantage. Riley writes as
though Nicaragua's polarized politics stem from antidemocratic failings
of the FSLN in terms of governance &#8211; another false myth propagated by
the absurdly incompetent Nicaraguan opposition. It is the bitter hatred
of corrupt opposition political leaders like Eduardo Montealegre and
Arnoldo Aleman and the endless meddling of cynical oligarchs like the
Chamorro family that have poisoned Nicaragua's political life. Even the
US embassy has finally been forced to acknowekledge that undeniable
truth.<br>
      <br>
In the meantime, Daniel Ortega's FSLN government, thanks to ALBA, has
dramatically reduced extreme poverty and reached several other of the
UN Millenium Development Goals well ahead of time. Government policies
have won praise from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the
Panamerican Health Organization, UNESCO, the IMF and the Inter-American
Developmnent Bank. That is the real news story in Nicaragua. Riley's
wearisome regurgitation of the discredited and irrelevant litany of
complaints from embittered Nicaraguan oligarchs has little to do with
the reality of what is happening in Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
The self evident purpose of COHA's intimate collaboration with CINCO is
to try and discredit Nicaragua's Sandinista government. Articles like
Riley's on Nicaragua serve to consolidate the Prospero baloney-spell
that keeps people in the US hopelessly ill-informed about what is going
on in Central America and Latin America generally. The accusation
against COHA is the same as that against the rest of the neocolonial
liberal, progressive and radical intellectual managerial classes in
North America and Europe. <br>
      <br>
To Nicaragua they apply the kind of Americanist criteria Malcolm X and
many others have criticised so eloquently. In practice, they
collaborate propagating the anti-Sandinista propaganda message of the
US State Department. It is worth asking why that should still be so
when the success of the FSLN government in Nicaragua is now
indisputable. <br>
      <br>
Not only have President Ortega and his team successfully defended
Nicaragua's impoverished majority against the worst effects of the rich
country provoked global recession. In that adverse economic context and
at great political disadvantage in the country's legislature, they have
increased the living standards of the worst off and made marked
advances in implementing the historic programme of the FSLN.<br>
      <br>
Most North American progressive and radical opinion does not recognize
that fact. Intellectuals and academics in moderately progressive bodies
like COHA and NACLA and writers who publish in supposedly more radical
outlets string along with counterfactual State Department and
Nicaraguan opposition propaganda. For such a broad intellectual class
to be so comprehensively wrong on Nicaragua is noteworthy. <br>
      <br>
For that class to let pass, never mind promote, the same disingenous
propaganda as the US State Department is conclusive proof that radical
and progressive opinion in the United States represent a loyal
opposition. Its members give the appearance of resisting government
policy but are ultimately extremely comfortable with the status quo.
Discussion of Nicaragua reveals that most progressive and radical
opinion in the United States is still irremediably imbued with the very
Americanism that Malcolm X denounced over forty years ago.<br>
