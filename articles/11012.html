after President Comandante Daniel's message to the families of Nicaragua<br />
<br />
January 11, 2021</strong></em><br />
<img alt="" height="450" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario94.jpg.html" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="350" /><br />
Good afternoon, a good beginning to the night, to reflect, to pray, to rest a little from all the tasks we undertake every day with Vigor and Glory, with Heroism, with Courage. Moving forward with this Nicaragua of Faith, of Family, of Community. Christian Nicaragua, Nicaragua in Solidarity, Nicaragua that overcomes !<br />
<br />
Here the cowardice is not known. This is a great, brave, noble, victorious People. Cowardice belongs to those who have sold out the Nation. Cowardice and greed. The Nicaraguan people who know how, step by step and with God's blessing, they work every day to advance, to prosper, and to learn as well, today is the Day of Education. To promote health and to promote all these programs that for us are Christian and in solidarity because they are programs of love for others.<br />
<br />
How many streets...! How many roads...! How many highways...! How many parks...! How many houses...! How much improvement to the water supply ! How much electrical energy ! How many advances in telecommunications this year ! Giving continuity to all the programs those who surely do not love their neighbors, do not feel, wanted to interrupt ; there is no sensitivity in those who attack and destroy what serves their neighbor. Neither sensitivity nor Christian commitment... no commitment !<br />
<br />
A good afternoon, a good day, and a good night, to reflect a lot, because we know that the Victory is of the Nicaraguan People, of the Nicaraguan families and that we are all protagonists. Because all the families in Nicaragua feel protagonists but also complementing each other.<br />
<br />
On our own, none of us can get ahead, but by complementing each other, and above all being able to count on a Government that takes into account each sister and brother, of all conditions, because there are people with disabilities, there are senior adults with chronic illnesses, there are young people who need to study, because by studying they feel they are getting ahead, and to practice sports, and recognize our national identity through Culture.<br />
<br />
And there are Women who have recovered, step by step, our sense of human dignity, and we have also achieved progress in the recognition of our capacity as well as our human dignity, because we are capable, we are strong. We have recovered that sense and we are occupying the places of decision. We are also protagonists of our history and our life.<br />
<br />
A beautiful afternoon, a beautiful night, beginning of the night. We feel, we know, we intuit, we move, with the purpose of overcoming, not one or two among us, but all of us. And all of us together. And to overcome means to keep on going, with Christian programs, in Solidarity, recognition of talent, of everyone, of the rights of everyone, and above all, of the right that we all have to live in well-being.<br />
<br />
The year has begun and we have received many messages from brothers and sisters, firstly committed to the paths of victory, and also secondly, messages from brothers and sisters who know, because we all know, that Unity for the Common Good must prevail. Those are our strengths, those are our values, those are the things we love, United for the Common Good ! And recognizing that these are social, economic, political processes of Nicaraguans, so as to live as Nicaraguans, and to live among Nicaraguans.<br />
<br />
So much so that our Comandante Daniel has spoken of the urgent need, and all of us Nicaraguans know this, for respect in relations between all the countries of the community that we call planetary, human, but in particular on the part of those countries that throughout our history have interfered, have invaded us, and above all have tried to direct our processes, even choosing People for certain roles. Unheard of, but real. Extraordinary, but true.<br />
<br />
A year to demand respect for blessed Nicaragua, for Christian Nicaragua. Respect for Nicaraguans. We are the ones who have to work in these times of building Unity, we Nicaraguans, without interference, without the interference of foreign agents.<br />
<br />
This is a call that we make to ourselves every day: not to allow foreign agents trying to decide for us who goes one way and who goes another. That is unwonted, disrespectful, irreverent !<br />
<br />
We, a poor, small, but struggling, courageous country, that never interferes in the economic, social, political processes of other nations that we know have the right to their sovereignty, just as we have the right in Nicaragua to live as a country and as a sovereign, independent people.<br />
<br />
200 Years of Independence here in Central America and the struggle continues, and Victory is certain, because we move on ahead, with that deep-rooted and profound sense of Independence and Interdependence Because in this world we have to complement each other, and that is the struggle also in the international organizations, so that the world that claims to be developed understands that nobody is saved alone, that we all have a voice and we all must participate in processes and human realities.<br />
<br />
So, we have thought a lot and as our Commander Daniel says, Nicaragua overcomes! It has won and will continue to win, because we live in faith, because every day we entrust ourselves to God and He gives us that spiritual force that everyone recognizes, observes, and with that spiritual force we say: This year 2021 we demand Respect for Nicaragua and for Nicaraguans, and we demand to live our Processes as a People and as a Sovereign Country. This is very important for us to bear in mind.<br />
<br />
And those who don't feel Nicaraguan are obviously always turning to their patrons. But it is not those patterns that determine either the present or the future of Nicaragua. We are Nicaraguans in Nicaragua, working together, with a sense of peace and well-being, appropriating our rights, our liberties, and all our processes.<br />
<br />
This is how it is, and God willing how it will be. Respect is the key to any form of human relationship, respect, and above all, respect for the dignity of all beings and the dignity of Peoples, of Countries and of the Processes that these Peoples and these Countries are living through.<br />
<br />
Nicaragua is made of Vigor and Glory, and we want, listening to Rubén whom we live as a cultural Heritage and as a champion of our national identity, Dario and Sandino, that is a People that overcomes, listening to him we know that we greet each other with optimism recognizing our values and our strengths, and that we cannot and should not continue to be dispersed, but rather, on the contrary, more and more United, for the Common Good !<br />
<br />
Thank you, Compañer@s, and let's get ahead ! Nicaragua, a People that Overcomes! Thank you, Compañer@s.</p>
