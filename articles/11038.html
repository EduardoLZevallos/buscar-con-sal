<p>I</p>

<p>There is no reason to celebrate and rejoice over what the American Union has suffered.</p>

<p>Resentment, the soulmate of hatred, has left nothing good on the face of the Earth. Nor greed, worse if it is the size of a coup d'état which, in nostalgic English for profitable sins, translates to "United Fruit Company."</p>

<p>In 2018, the plague of brutality unleashed by the fascist right, in its most heinous scale of terror, ravaged a motherland consecrated to peace: Nicaragua. And because we experienced it, we cannot applaud evil attacks on the United States. Or anywhere on the planet, although in this case, the vile industry of false witness defaces the barbarism of the "civic spring" with the broad brush of its covers, editorials and primetime hours.</p>

<p>The congressmen, still guarded by the Capitol Police, feared for their physical integrity. And although they were unharmed, they became victims of that of which some have prescribed for Latin America.</p>

<p>Two years ago, in Nicaragua, many citizens were not as lucky as the legislators: they were brutally murdered by those “peaceful students,” an image financed and portrayed by the very same people who pushed a fiery mass to carry out the coup on Washington.</p>

<p>That's when you realize that life is worth nothing for the fascists who have sufficient flame of rage, as well as the financial fuel of the Trump Administration, to set Nicaragua ablaze.</p>

<p>The "defenseless protesters" burned people alive, burned radio stations such as La Nueva Radio Ya, regardless of the journalists, artists, technicians, administrative personnel and valuable sound archives that were kept in their studios. They burnt various Municipal Offices, like the one in Granada, they destroyed public and private buildings, they attacked police stations, like the one in Jinotepe, using snipers and even gasoline trucks.</p>

<p>And they left the country in ruins. All in order to capture power under the same old pretext of "electoral fraud" or for the purpose of democracy."</p>

<p>Therefore, there is nothing to celebrate, but it is time to reflect, especially when the incoming former president, Donald Trump, was accused by the House of Representatives of "inciting insurrection" and fomenting a coup.</p>

<p>Can Mr. Antler and other "domestic terrorists" of the United States ever be presidential and legislative candidates?</p>

<p>The answer, more than political or ideological, is a matter of spiritual health and justice.</p>

<p>Someone who does not respect the Constitution; who would profane, delightfully, the Temple of Democracy, in other words The Capitol; who does not tolerate the will of the majority of the people, well expressed in the polls, who acts ostentatiously outside of the law ... how could he be rewarded with a candidacy?</p>

<p>It was reported that four days after the attempted coup, the authorities would be detaining hundreds of people accused for "federal destruction and murder."</p>

<p>That is what any nation must do in order to find the agitators. And, in this case, neither the media nor any congressman speaks of “repression of the people,” or “intimidation of Americans”.</p>

<p>The US is not described as a "police state" just because, according to the media, "the FBI, thanks to the public, has received more than 100,000 videos and photographs as evidence to conduct its investigations."</p>

<p>No European or Asian government has threatened the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, with sanctions because he warned 200 identified suspects: "We know who you are... and FBI agents are on their way to find you."</p>

<p>This first coup cost the loss of five people and injured 51 police officers. This could not be "duly" exported to Latin America, for reasons that are only of the knowledge of Trump, Pompeo and their inner circle, and it was entangled in the shipwreck of his re-election, the State Department and the White House to unravel - to the stupor of humanity - on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>"El País", Efe, CNN, etc., Will they be willing to elevate these violent men as genuine "American patriots"?</p>

<p>Will the search for the coup conspirators be labeled by the IACHR and Luis Almagro as "fierce repression"? Will they launch an international campaign to pathetically promote them as "politically persecuted"?</p>

<p>Will Mr. Vivanco of Human Rights Watch and Mrs. Bachelet, High Commissioner for Human Rights, declare the detainees, as "political prisoners"?</p>

<p>Perhaps when they are inhibited to positions of popular election, the hemispheric violators of international law, as the "OAS" and its henchmen are satirically known in the underworld, will they denounce the United States and the new government as "undemocratic" for not allowing their “champions” to participate in the next elections?  </p>

<p>II</p>

<p>What happened at the Congress of the most powerful country on Earth may have consumed less time than a working day, but it has compressed the inglorious weight of an unwanted historical event; it was not implanted from the outside.</p>

<p>With decency, the international community left the political flannels to demand respect for the institutions of the United States, or to say, "it is an internal matter."</p>

<p>No savage came out there, as often happens from the fascist right wing, vindicating the coup conspirators and declaring them "guardians of Democracy", "sons of George Washington" and "heirs of Tomas Jefferson."</p>

<p>There was no embassy nor agencies of other powers fueling the coup conspirators and supremacists to "liberate" the "American people."</p>

<p>They did not encourage the "pacifists" to reproduce the painful tragedies that the terrorist hordes, raised from abroad, leave in their wake as they unleash their demonic ambitions, theatrically staged in scenes such as "patriotic struggles" and "peaceful demonstrations."</p>

<p>Not a single discredited “human rights” NGO appeared convening press conferences, writing disinformation and inflating “lists” of hundreds of “dead”, “disappeared” and “tortured”, and signing as many statements manufactured by foreign sources as possible, in order to finish setting the United States on fire.</p>

<p>No nation pointed the finger and because it-pleases-me-to-do-so, the man who took over the office of Senator Nancy Pelosi, as the white Guaidó of the "real" United States, because Mr. Joe Biden "usurped" with a "spectacular fraud" the "overwhelming victory" of candidate Trump.</p>

<p>No. None of that happened.</p>

<p>But, when something more perverse to what happened in the District of Columbia is experienced by a Latin American Republic, not for a few hours, but months like in Nicaragua –with 200 years of precarious Independence–, why does the European Union rush to praise the criminal terrorist violence and glorifies it as "the people" or "vigorous civil society"?</p>

<p>Andrew Cuomo, the governor of the State of New York, did not beat around the bushes. He described the assault on The Capitol as a "failed coup", executed as the "final chapter of an incompetent, cruel and divisive Administration."</p>

<p>And it is precisely this Administration, that has also supported its reflection in Nicaragua, conditioned by millionaire “incentives” through treacherous “Democracy Building” programs: for the ruthless coup conspirators.</p>

<p>Today, they just outline a group of uninhabited acronyms, causally - not casually - with the same mediocre performance, added to an unhealthy moral code and a total refusal to earn their daily bread, as God intended. They prefer to sell their soul to the devil, including the country.</p>

<p>The noble people do not feel represented by the heartless. Why? For being the banana extension of the Trump Administration: "Incompetent, Cruel and Divisive."</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Armed Forces did not sit idly by: "Actions inside the Capitol building are incompatible with the rule of law."</p>

<p>"The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection."</p>

<p>And since the Constitution of Nicaragua is neither inferior nor superior to the Constitution of the United States, the words of the Military High Command of the American Union are as valid here as there.</p>

<p>“We support and defend the Constitution. Any act that disturbs the constitutional process not only goes against our traditions, values ​​and oath, but also against the law.”</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of every professional Army: to impose order, not to "quarter" because "it is not deliberative."</p>

<p>Michael Sherwin declared that the Capitol area is a "crime scene."</p>

<p>This is what every National Prosecutor must do.</p>

<p>Jim McGovern, an opposition Democratic representative, denounced that: “Our country was attacked, not by a foreign nation, but from within. These were not protesters, they were not patriots. They were traitors. These were domestic terrorists ... and they were acting under orders made by Donald Trump.”</p>

<p>It is a responsibility that every magnificent politician, government official, opponent or congressman, even more so a bishop, obliged to assume before history: not to hide or gild the pill with sibylline language, but to call bread, bread and wine, wine.</p>

<p>Los Angeles Times in its editorial, concluded that January 6 can be considered "an insurrection, a tragedy, a coup," while The New York Times stated that Trump should be brought to justice "just like his supporters who carried out the violence.”</p>

<p>A commentator for The Washington Post wrote: “Let's be clear: what happened in the US Capitol was an attempted coup, incited by a lawless president (…) and encouraged by the cynical Republican facilitators in Congress.”</p>

<p>It is the essence of journalism: do not deform, do not lie, do not manipulate.</p>

<p>In other words, to act absolutely contrary to the merchants of the venal press, dedicated to prefabricating crises that lead to a coup if the legitimate government of a country does not adjust to their interests, which are always decorated with bombastic but empty slogans: “ The conscience of the nation ”,“ The voice of the people ”,“ At the service of… ”.</p>

<p>One step away from the White House, Joe Biden accused: “The criminal attack was planned and coordinated. It was carried out by political extremists and domestic terrorists, who were incited to this violence by President Trump. It was an armed insurrection against the United States of America. Those responsible must be held accountable”.</p>

<p>It is the least that is expected from any good President.</p>
