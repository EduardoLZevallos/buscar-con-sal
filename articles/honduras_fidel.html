<br>
While US
President Barack Obama, on a visit to Moscow to discuss vital matters
about nuclear arms, declared that Manuel Zelaya is the only
constitutional president of Honduras is Manuel Zelaya, in Washington
the extreme right wingers and the hawks were creating the conditions
necessary to oblige Zelaya to negotiate a humiliating apology for the
illegalities the coup leaders attributed to him. <br>
<br>
It was obvious that such an act would mean, to his followers, and to
the world, his disappearance from the political scene. <br>
<br>
It
is beyond doubt that when Zelaya announced his intention to return to
Honduras on July 5th, he was determined to fulfill his promise of
confronting,&nbsp;alongside his people, the brutal repression
ordered
by the coup leaders. <br>
<br>
Accompanying President Zelaya were the
pro tempore president of the UN General Assembly, Miguel
D'Escoto,&nbsp;and Honduran Foreign Minister, Patricia Rodas as
well as
a Telesur journalist and another nine people. Zelaya maintained his
decision to land. I can confirm that when the plane was approaching
Tegucigalpa, the president was informed of the images being broadcast
by Telesur of the enormous crowd of supporters waiting to greet him at
the airport who were being attacked by soldiers with tear gas and the
fire of automatic rifles. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
His immediate reaction was to
request to go live on Telesur to denounce the millitary's actions and
demand that the leaders of the troops in question cease the repression.
He then informed them that the plane would proceed to land. At that
point the head of the millitary presence at the airport ordered the
runway to be blocked. In a matter of seconds motorized transport
vehicles obstructed&nbsp;the runway. <br>
<br>
The Falcon jet flew over
the airport, at a low altitude, three times. Specialists explain that
the most tense and dangerous moment for pilots of rapid, low profile
aircrafts, like the one Zelaya was travelling in, is when they reduce
speed in preparation for landing. For this reason I believe that
Zelaya's attempt to return to Honduras was brave and
audacious.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If the coup leaders were keen to prosecute him for supposed
constitutional crime, why did they not allow him to land?<br>
<br>
Zelaya
knows that it was not just the constitution of Honduras that was at
stake, but also the right of the people of Latin America to elect
their&nbsp;leaders. <br>
<br>
Today Honduras is not just a country
occupied by the coup leaders, but also a country occupied by the armed
forces of the United States. <br>
<br>
The Soto Cano Millitary base,
also known by its other name Palmerola, which is located at less than
100 kilometers from Tegucigalpa, was upgraded in 1981 by Ronald
Reagan's administration in order to be used by Colonel Oliver North
when he coordinated the dirty war against Nicaragua, and by the US
government which directed attacks against the Salvadoran and Guatemalan
revolutionaries from this point, attacks that costs dozens of thousands
of lives. <br>
<br>
In Soto Cano the US Joint Task Force-Bravo can be
found. This task force, which is made up of elements of the Air Force,
Navy and Army, occupies more than 85% of the area of the military
base. In Eva Golinger's article "The US military base in Honduras at
the center of the coup,"&nbsp;published in the website Rebelión on
July
2nd 2009, she divulges the role of the task force. She explains that:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
Honduran Constitution does not legally permit the presence of foreign
military bases in the country. An informal agreement between Washington
and Honduras authorizes the important strategic presence of the
hundreds of US soldiers in the base as part of a semipermanent treaty.
The treaty was signed in 1954 as part of the millitary
aid the US offered Honduras ... the third poorest country in the
hemisphere.</span> ... <span style="font-style: italic;">The
agreement that permits the US millitary presence in the Central
American country can be overturned without notice."</span><br>
</div>
<br>
Soto
Cano also serves as the headquaters of the Honduran Aviation Academy.
Part of the components of the US military task force are made up
of&nbsp;Honduran soldiers.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
What is the objective of the US
millitary base, airplanes,&nbsp;helicopters and task force in
Honduras?
Without doubt it is in order to be employed in Central America. The
fight against drugs does not require this much military capacity.<br>
<br>
If
President Manuel Zepaya is not reinstated into his post, the threat of
a wave of coup d'etats toppling a number governments in Latin America
would arise. Or the same governments could find themselves at the mercy
of extreme right wing millitary officers, trained in the security
doctrines of the School of the Americas with its expertise in torture,
psycological warfare and terror. The authority of many civil
governments
in Central and South America would be weakened. Those gloomy times
are not so distant. The military coup leaders do not even pay
attention to the civil administration of the US. It could be very bad
for a president like Barack Obama who wants to improve the image of his
country. Formally the Pentagon obeys civil power. As in imperial Rome,
the
legions have not yet assumed control of the empire.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It
would be incomprehensible if Zelaya now permitted delay tactics to
wear down the considerable social forces that support him, leading to
an irrepairable decline. <br>
<br>
The illegally overthrown President is
not interested in power, but defends a principle, and like Martí said:
"a just principle from the depths of a cave, can achieve more than an
entire army."
