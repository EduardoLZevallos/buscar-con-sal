<br />
Good morning everyone!<br />
<br />
Today as in previous years, we are meeting in these days of October, to carry out the Central Opening Ceremony of the Protection and Security Plan for the Coffee Harvest.<br />
<br />
On this occasion, this event corresponds to the 2025-2026 Production Cycle.<br />
<br />
I would like to highlight the relevant and very high participation of workers, producers, cooperative members, traders, exporters and representatives of different sectors.<br />
<br />
Events like this, with the presence of more than 4,500 people, reflect the level of importance and approval that we all give to security and peace in our rural areas, and therefore to the security and Peace of our country.<br />
<br />
This significant presence, is the clear expression of the desire of everyone to work to produce and prosper in peace.<br />
<br />
I would like to convey the greetings of the Presidency of the Republic of Comandante Daniel Ortega and Compañera Rosario Murillo, and tell you that the Presidency has the firm determination to support and provide the necessary resources for the successful implementation of this Plan for the Protection and Security of the Coffee Harvest.<br />
<br />
Planning since October 3rd we have planned and prepared with different institutions and representatives of the coffee sector setting ourselves as a fundamental objective:<br />
<br />
To guarantee the best security conditions stability, tranquility and peace so as to ensure the protection of life and the proper development of the present coffee-growing Productive Cycle, so that more than 500 thousand Nicaraguans can satisfactorily fulfill their various labor and productive activities in the coffee-growing areas of our country.<br />
<br />
In fulfillment of these goals we want you to know that the Nicaraguan Army is always making the maximum efforts to achieve the best conditions of security, stability, tranquility and Peace.<br />
<br />
To comply with this Protection and Security Plan for the Coffee Harvest, the Nicaraguan Army will deploy up to 3 thousand military personnel in the coffee-growing areas of the departments of Matagalpa, Jinotega, Esteli, Nueva Segovia, Madriz, Managua, Boaco, Carazo, and in the municipalities of Nueva Guinea and Ticuantepe.<br />
<br />
Coffee-growing areas, where coordinated efforts will be made with our brothers of the National Police and the different institutions and authorities, to ensure the success of this harvest.<br />
<br />
The Coffee Crop Protection Plan, for the Nicaraguan Army is an important part of the Security Plan in the Countryside. A plan by which we guarantee to all of you, farmers and producers, stability and tranquility in your different economic activities such as livestock, agriculture, trade and the transfer of goods.<br />
<br />
Brother and Sister producers! You can be absolutely certain that with this deployment of troops, we will contribute firmly so that you can achieve the projected goals for this productive cycle 2025-2026, which according to your calculations are on the order of more than 3 million hundredweight.<br />
<br />
Brother and Sister producers! In this even it is important to remember that security is a permanent condition to achieve and sustain, because it benefits us all equally; that is why we say that we must all contribute to it, contributing to our institutions which, as mandated by law, have the responsibility to guarantee it.<br />
<br />
We should all be aware that it is better to prevent and avoid any increase in crimes than to try to restore lost levels of security.<br />
<br />
That is why it is important to emphasize that having excellent levels of security means having stability and tranquility, and to have Security is to have peace! Peace which is the necessary condition to be able to work, produce, ensure well-being for our families and contribute to national development with social justice.<br />
<br />
Brother and Sister Producers!<br />
<br />
Today we reaffirm to you that we are not going to allow kidnapping to return to these territories, we are not going to allow you to be extorted again, much less any attempts to murder you, because our troops will act firmly against any attempt by criminals who seek to affect the security of our peasants, our producers and our rural population in general.<br />
<br />
High costs in human lives were suffered years ago when increasing production, but today we can do so safely and in peace, we are never going to allow setbacks in security in our rural areas.<br />
<br />
You can be absolutely certain that our forces and means deployed in the territory will be protecting the safety of you brother and sister workers, producers, ranchers, traders, transport operators and population in general, so that you carry out your different activities for the benefit of your families and contribute to the development of the country<br />
<br />
Therefore, together with all the institutions involved in the formulation of this Inter-Institutional Plan for the Protection and Security of the Coffee Harvest, we have arranged our capabilities and the best of our efforts, to support you in everything we can for your dignified and hard work, today, we have received recognition plaques, which we thank on behalf of all those who make up the Nicaraguan Army, these plaque awards reflect the level of trust you place in this institution which belongs to you and is to serve you,.... that's why we say:<br />
<br />
"We are the People themselves in uniform, working for their own benefit."<br />
<br />
I also want to thank on behalf of all my brothers and sisters in arms, the expressions of recognition expressed in their words by the producers Eduardo Cuadra from Matagalpa, and the Licenciada Irías from Jinotega.<br />
<br />
Your words and the presence of everyone at this event encourage all members of the Nicaraguan Army to serve our people in the best possible way.<br />
<br />
Likewise, our brothers and sisters of the National Police thank you, and rest assured that we will also support you.<br />
<br />
Beloved producers and workers of the coffee sector:<br />
<br />
It is important to continue strengthening the levels of communication we have achieved, because that communication is a reflection of trust, and this allows us to coordinate efforts to meet the goals and objectives set for this harvest, that's why our chiefs of staff and officers have the order to attend you, listen to you, support you, and our military units will always be open to receive you.<br />
<br />
To our brother and sister farmers, workers, producers, merchants, transport operators and the productive sector in general, we reiterate that we will fulfill our missions in the best possible way, and from now on we wish you success in this harvest, all of you from your dignified and dedicated work, contributing to the well-being of your families and the well-being of our Nation.<br />
<br />
Brother and sister producers!<br />
<br />
Today, we want to ratify before all of you, that we are going to assure you the best conditions of security, stability, tranquility and peace.<br />
Peace, which is the people's guarantee to be able to work, produce, achieve the well-being of families, strengthen the national economy and develop ourselves with social justice.<br />
<br />
That's why everything that this People’s children in uniform do is to contribute with all our strength and energy to guarantee these conditions of Peace!<br />
Peace, to which we will always contribute and we will firmly defend, because it is the greatest desire of our worthy, hardworking and noble people.<br />
<br />
In the Nicaraguan Army: we say what we do and do what we say and on this institutional postulate together with the values of Honor, Ethics and Honesty, we base our credibility.<br />
<br />
