<p><strong>SPEECH BY COMPAÑERO DENIS MONCADA COLINDRES, IN THE EXTRAORDINARY SESSION<br />
OF THE PERMANENT COUNCIL OF THE OAS, JULY 11th, 2018</strong></p>

<p>Mrs. Ambassador Rita Hernández, President of the Permanent Council of the OAS.</p>

<p>Mr. Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the OAS.</p>

<p>Mr. Paulo Abráo, Executive Secretary of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).</p>

<p>Permanent and Alternate Representatives and Observers of the Permanent Missions to the OAS.</p>

<p>Nicaragua wishes to reaffirm to this Permanent Council of the OAS, its sustained commitment to the respect and protection of the human rights of all Nicaraguans and the people of other States that reside or transit through our country.</p>

<p>The Political Constitution of Nicaragua recognizes and guarantees fundamental rights in its Article 46 which states:<br />
 <br />
"In the National Territory, the State will provide protection and recognition of the inherent rights of all persons; the unrestricted respect, promotion and protection of all Human Rights, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man; the United Nations´ International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the Interamerican Convention on Human Rights of the Organization of American States."</p>

<p>The Government of Nicaragua will continue to comply with the international commitments of the State in the matter of Human Rights, in a joint effort between government and citizens, contributing to restore the recognized security, stability and peace that Nicaragua enjoyed before the painful events of April 18th.</p>

<p>Currently, the Nicaraguan people have suffered the attacks of both internal and external terrorists and political groups, in collusion with international organized crime, aimed at carrying out a coup d'état and overthrowing the legitimate Government of President Daniel Ortega, democratically elected according to the Political Constitution of Nicaragua and the laws of the country.<br />
We take note of the presentation of the report on the Installation of the Special Follow-up Mechanism for Nicaragua (MESENI) and the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI).</p>

<p>On May 30th, we signed an agreement with the General Secretariat of the OAS and the Executive Secretariat of the IACHR for the creation of the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI), with the purpose of supporting and assisting in the investigations initiated by the State for the clarification of the acts of violence that occurred from April 18th to May 30th of the current year.</p>

<p>We officially welcomed the members of the Group of Experts on July 2nd, and the Executive Secretariat of the IACHR announced its official installation on July 3rd in Managua.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Agreement for the creation of the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts, we are currently in the process of agreeing on a protocol and framework of collaboration, to implement and comply with said agreement, based on the Rule of Law and respecting the sovereignty of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>On the first week of July, the technical team of the Follow-up Mechanism arrived in Nicaragua to provide support and assistance to the Verification and Security Commission of the National Dialogue, as well as the Delegation of the General Secretariat of the OAS.</p>

<p>During their stay in Nicaragua, coordinations were made with state institutions in order for the MESENI technical team to travel and visit detention centers, where they were able to observe the conditions of the detainees, and verify that they were not subjected to torture, denying what was expressed by opposition media channels.</p>

<p>We have also received a visit from the Regional Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to which the Government of Nicaragua has provided the required support in order for them to be able to observe the human rights situation in the country.</p>

<p>Our Government has been constantly informing the IACHR, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the distinguished Permanent, Alternate and Observer Missions about terrorist acts caused by the groups that attempt to overthrow the legitimate and Constitutional Government of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The Government of Nicaragua continues to work to restore peace and security which has been interrupted since April 18th, with these nefarious terrorist acts, assassinations, kidnappings, fires, torture, looting and destruction of family homes, as well as public and private buildings.</p>

<p>On June 19th, a group of armed and hooded terrorists stole 2 fuel truck which they parked 100 meters away from the Jinotepe Police Station, in a populated area, and began throwing mortars and Molotov cocktails, threatening to blow them up and putting at risk the lives of many citizens. This is clearly a terrorist act.</p>

<p>The Fire Department warned that an explosion would affect the surrounding area in a radius of ​​800 meters, endangering families and homes of 4 neighborhoods in the city of Jinotepe.</p>

<p>In the city of Jinotepe and surrounding communities the same terrorist groups, held hostage over 400 Central American drivers from El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras, whom suffered from hunger, disease, harassment and death threats for over 40 days.</p>

<p>The Political Constitution of Nicaragua recognizes the right to peaceful protest and establishes State protection and recognition of the inherent rights of all humans. It also ensures that the rights of each person are limited by the rights of others, for the security of all and for the just demands of the common good.</p>

<p>Peaceful protest must not be confused with terrorism, the consequences of which have left the civilian population immersed in a trail of assassinations, kidnappings, torture, threats of explosions and hostage-takings, as is the case of the more than 400 Central American drivers.</p>

<p>In response to the call and concerns of the governments of the countries of the Central American Integration System, expressed at the Summit of Heads of State and Government on June 30th in the Dominican Republic, our Government has expressed to the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua and to the IACHR, its duty to accompanying and ensure the protection of the lives and rights of these Central American drivers, without obtaining any positive results or communications condemning the violations of the rights of these individuals.</p>

<p>The Government of Nicaragua has emphatically condemned all acts of terrorist violence that have occurred from April 18th to date, which have caused mourning within the Nicaraguan families. We repudiate these actions that have been attacking the peace, stability, unity and reconciliation that all Nicaraguans enjoyed without distinctions of any kind.</p>

<p>Among the crimes committed by these terrorist groups in the cities of Jinotepe and Diriamba, 8 comrades have been murdered. 20 comrades kidnapped, 16 public institutions have been attacked, looted, burned or destroyed. Parents and children have been murdered, as is the case of Cristhoper Castillo and Roberto Castillo Cruz. Comrades of the Police, Sandinista members and youth have been targeted for kidnapping and murder and subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, never before seen in the history of our country. This is not peaceful protest, it is terrorism and violence aimed at promoting chaos and breaking the Constitutional Order. Attached find list of Terrorist Actions in Jinotepe and Diriamba.</p>

<p>In this context of an attempted coup d'état and breaking the constitutional order in Nicaragua, the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN), has made it known to the Nicaraguan families and the international community, that as a legally and legitimately constituted State and Government, it has the duty to defend Security, Peace, the Right to Life and the exercise of the fundamental rights of all Nicaraguans, including the right to free movement of people, vehicles and merchandise throughout the national territory.</p>

<p>Nicaragua has already said enough is enough to the suffering imposed by right-wing terrorist groups on the Nicaraguan families, who have been held hostage since April 18th to date in clear violation of the United Nations Convention against the Taking of Hostages and the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism.</p>

<p>Honorable Representatives,</p>

<p>The Government of Nicaragua recognizes that every Nicaraguan citizen has the right to life, liberty and security, as established in the Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Interamerican Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>The GRUN reiterates to the people of Nicaragua and the international community their unwavering commitment to continue working to restore Security, Peace, the Right to Life, harmony and peaceful coexistence, the Unity and Reconciliation of all Nicaraguans; to confront terrorism, crime, kidnapping, torture, cruel inhuman and degrading treatment, enforcing the Constitution and the Laws of the country for the common good, for which the Nicaraguan Police and all State institutions must comply, along with all other functions and provisions mandated by the Constitution and the Laws of the Republic.</p>

<p>Once peace, security and the free exercise of the fundamental rights of all Nicaraguans have been restored, the GRUN reiterates to the people of Nicaragua, to the member countries of the OAS and to the international community, our full readiness to listen to all proposals and initiatives for democratization and institutional strengthening that may arise from the National Dialogue, within the framework of the Constitution and the laws that govern the country, in order that they may be agreed upon for approval, ensuring that all points related to peace, security, tranquility are previously addressed for the benefit of all Nicaraguan families; including the cessation of terrorism, the free movement of people and public and private transport, so vital for the survival of all Nicaraguan families.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Madam President.</p>
