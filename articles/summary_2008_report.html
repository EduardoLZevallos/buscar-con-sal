of President Daniel Ortega's Annual Report to the
National Assembly:<br>
</span></big><br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">By
Karla
Jacobs, January 19th 2009</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">On January
10th President Daniel Ortega presented the Executive's
annual report for 2008 to the National Assembly. The full report, which
gives detailed information about the progress of social and other
programs as well as outlining the government's economic plan for the
coming months, is 150 pages. To read the full report in Spanish <a style="font-family: sans-serif;" href="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/informe_an_2009.pdf">click

<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<big style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I. The Crisis of Global
Capitalism</span></big><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">After a
lengthy introduction giving the FSLN government's take on the
causes of the international financial crisis and the prospects for the
national and international economy in the coming months, the
President's report calls for
decisions concerning the new model on which to
base the world economy to be taken at a global level and not by
exclusive groups like the G8, or the G20:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Until
now all the
policies and measures put in place [by different governments around the
world] aim to manage the crisis and create
conditions to reactivate the economy. There is still no plan to
restructure the global financial and economic architecture based on
stable, equitative and sustainable foundations. <br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
President of the
General Assembly of the United Nations Father Miguel D'Escoto Brockman,
has named a High Level Commission led by the Economic Nobel Prize
winner Joseph Stiglitz to come up with such a proposal which will be
presented at an
International Conference of the highest level about the World Financial
and Economic Crisis which the UN General Assembly has planned for the
end of May, 2009. On November 15th
the ad
hoc group G20 met in Washington. At that time it was agreed the group
would meet again in
April. <br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Nicaragua's
position is that is must not
be the G1, the G7, the
G20 or any other ad hoc group that should approve a new financial and
economic architecture. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">As the
crass errors of commission and omission committed by the
financial and governmental sectors of developed countries during the
current crisis confirm, decisions that affect all of us should be taken
with the participation of all of us. Only the UN General Assembly, or
the G192, can legitimately and legally take such decisions.</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>II.
Defending Nicaragua and the Poor
from
the Speculation of Neo-liberal Financial Capital</big><br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify">The government
describes its efforts to reestablish the State's responsibility to
guarantee the population's basic rights:<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
Government of Reconciliation and
National Unity's fundamental plan when it came to power in January 2007
was to replace the neo-liberal global capitalist socio-economic model
with the model of equitative development made possible via Citizen
Power...<br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Neo-liberal
capitalism is immoral in that
it denies the rights of the poor to education, health care, a health
environment, housing, water and sanitation. [Within neo-liberal
capitalism] it is not considered an obligation of the State to
guarantee access to these basic services. From its first day the
Government of Reconciliation and National Unity has been working
towards the reduction of the negative impact neo-liberal capitalism
has had on Nicaragua and on the poor.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify">The report goes on
to detail initial government efforts to guarantee access for all to
health care and education as well as subsidizing public transport in
Managua, introducing subsidies for the services of water and
electricity
and exempting low income workers from income tax payments.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-family: sans-serif;" align="justify">During the second
semester of 2007 and the first semester of 2008 when the inflationary
wave took hold and prices of basic goods shot up other measures were
introduced such as:<br>
</p>
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>The reactivation of ENABAS (the National Basic Food
Company) which has established a network of community run points of
basic foods sold to the population at below market prices. 2,700 points
of sale has been set up benefiting 2,700,000 families (1,350,000
people).</li>
<li>The reduction of import tax on chicken, and the
elimination
of import tax on flour, beans, oatmeal and other basic foods.</li>
<li>A government subsidy of US$1.30 on every gallon of
fuel
used by public transport between May and December 2008 (during which
time the international oil price shot to unprecedented heights) in
order to avoid increases in the price the population pays for public
transport.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The report
goes on to emphasize the importance of Nicaragua's
incorporation into ALBA (the Bolivarian Alternative for the People of
Our America) in reducing the impact of the ongoing energy, food and
financial crises. Without the preferential energy agreement Nicaragua
has with Venezuela as part of the ALBA framework Nicaragua would have
had to disburse an additional US$375 million to import oil and gasoline
during 2007 and 2008. Thanks to the energetic agreement, however, this
same sum has made available for government social and infrastructure
programs including many of the above mentioned programs. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Also as a
result of its incorporation into ALBA and decisive government
policies in search of economic alternatives to the failed neo-liberal
capitalist model, Nicaragua has broadened and diversified its
participation in regional markets within Latin America and the
Caribbean.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<big style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">III. Defending the Economy:
the government's effort to manage the collapse of neo-liberal capitalism</span></big><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">After the
financial crisis of
September - October 2008 ... the effects of the collapse of neo-liberal
capitalism began to be felt in Nicaragua. ... <br>
<br>
The Nicaraguan private sector with direct access to international
credit can no longer access that credit as easily.<br>
<br>
Some of the products Nicaragua exports like seafood, beef, peanuts and
coffee are experiencing a reduction in price and demand. These problems
are expected to extend to others export goods in 2009 - 2010.<br>
<br>
</span></div>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
government predicts a reduction in foreign aid as a result of the
recession, as well as a reduction in family remittances sent back by
Nicaraguans immigrants living in foreign countries and the return of
migrants unable to find employment in the foreign countries where they
are currently living. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">All
of these factors will contribute to the contraction of the national
economy, the reduction of employment, the tax collection for the
National Budget. In light of this situation the national objectives for
the defense of the economy and of employment should be:<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">1.
The unity of all the economic, social and political forces in the
country.</span><span style="font-style: italic;">
... We must all work
together to minimize the damage [of the depression] given that recovery
is more difficult for smaller periphery economies. An example of this
is
that after the Great Depression in 1930 Nicaragua did not recover the
1929 level of production until 1950. ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">2.
Maximum
national autonomy in policies and measures. <br>
3. The leadership of the State and of public investment in the defense
of the economy and of employment.<br>
4. Maximum cooperation with the Central American and ALBA integration
processes. <br>
5. Maximum activation of all the country's strategic relations for
funding, investment and commerce. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">The world is less unipolar and
more
multi polar in January 2009 than it was in January 2008. The world's
liquidity is no longer in Wall Street or in London ... but in
Beijing,&nbsp; the Persian Gulf and Russia. Nicaragua is well
positioned in this new multi polar world and this position must be
taken
advantage of to the maximum in order to defend the economy and
employment. ... </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
</span></div>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The report
goes on to outline the Program of Defense of the Economy and
of Employment which has been designed by the economic cabinet. This
program, based on the above listed five fundamental principals, will
consist of three key programs: 1) Activation of Production and Exports
for Growth and Employment, 2) Public Investments for Growth and
Employment, 3) Private Investments for Growth and Employment. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Some of the
fundamental objectives of this national economic program
are to reduce dependency on foreign aid, "which does not bring
development but creates dependency," consolidate Nicaragua's strategic
relations in the new multi polar world and take on one or more
mega projects which will guarantee a decade or more of stable
employment
and economic development. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;"><big>IV.
The Construction of the
Development Model of Citizen Power in Nicaragua </big><br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
report outlines the advances in the
implementation of the Citizen Power development model, a model the
government says aims to guarantee human survival and the fulfillment of
human potential through structural transformations allowing human
development and growth. The model is based on the fundamental values of
solidarity, community, complementarity, inclusion, redistribution and
equality. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;"></span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
government has been working towards restoring the population's
basic rights and reversing the process of privatization in the
provision of many basic services. Below is a selection of the social
gains registered by the government in 2008.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Education</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>The illiteracy rate has been reduced to 7.5%,
Nicaragua's
lowest ever rate</li>
<li>The national curriculum has been transformed to
include
transversal themes such as the national reality, a culture of peace and
gender equality<br>
</li>
<li>The rate of school desertion has been reduced from
13% (in
2006) to 6% (in 2008)</li>
<li>956,530 school children received free school meals
during
2008, 13% more than in 2007</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Health</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>The number of medical consultations within the public
health system rose by 11.2% in 2008 compared to 2007 (in 2007 this
figure rose by 34.3% compared to 2006)</li>
<li>The number of prescriptions and corresponding
medicines
given out by the health system rose by 27.7% compared to 2007 (in 2007
this figure rose by 50%)</li>
<li>The number of infants under twelve months receiving
regular
check ups within the health system in 2008 is 11% greater than in 2006.</li>
<li>The maternal mortality rate experienced a significant
reduction in 2008 from 89 maternal deaths in 2007 to 63 maternal deaths
in 2008.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The Communal Family Health Model is being implemented
with
the aim of identifying at risk individuals and families. So far 849
communal family health teams have been organized. </li>
<li>In 2007 three oftamological centers were built in
Nicaragua
with help from the Cuban government (one in RAAN, one in RAAS and one
in Ciudad Sandino). These centers facilitated over 22,000 oftamological
operations free of charge for impoverished Nicaraguans during 2008.</li>
<li>Rehabilitation work has been completed on health
centers in
El Rama and Corn Island and on hospitals in La Trinidad, Jinotega,
Waspan and Rio San Juan. <br>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Water
and Sanitation<br>
</span>
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>The percentage of the urban population with access to
running water has risen from 65% in 2006, 73% in 2007 to 77% in 2008 as
a result of the construction of 30 new running water systems in towns
and cities across the country</li>
<li>ENACAL (the national water company) will start work
on the
construction of running water systems and sanitation projects in the
near future in 35 different neighbourhoods in Managua and in the towns
of Rivas, San Juan del Sur and Boaco among others.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Housing</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>1,274 houses were built for impoverished families</li>
<li>2,960 houses were declared social housing and
exonerated
from VAT</li>
<li>2,868 families were given low interest rate credits
to
carry out repairs to their homes</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Family</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>59,764 preschool children were involved in
nutritional
programs during the year<br>
</li>
<li>2,500 street children and adolescents are involved in
a
government program designed to reintegrate them into family life and
schooling (1,125 are already back at school)</li>
<li>16.5 million cordobas has been transfered to 33 state
run
CDIs (day care centers for the children of working mothers) which take
care of 4,000 children between the age of 3 and 6. </li>
</ul>
<big style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">V. Macro economy and Credit</span></big><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Overall
Nicaragua ended 2008 with encouraging macroeconomic indicators
including 3.2% annual growth, a reduction of inflation compared to 2007
(13.77% in 2008, 16.9% in 2007), a 2% increase in international
reserves compared to 2007 and a 25% increase in exports compared to
2007.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
government received US$324.9 million in foreign aid (favorable
conditioned loans and donations) during 2008. The government has signed
agreements for US$371.9 million in foreign aid for 2009. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Regarding the
suspension of aid from certain donors the report states:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">At
the end of 2008 a group of donors including the European Union, Finland
and Holland informed the government of the decision not to disburse a
certain amount of the aid money previously guaranteed for budget
support. ... The government was informed that the money not disbursed
in 2008 would be disbursed in 2009. </span><br>
</div>
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Similarly
the Millennium Challenge Account, which is not considered as official
development aid given that it is not a program that is carried out by
the government but by a non profit organization ... decided to
temporarily suspend new contracts.<br>
<br>
</span></div>
<big style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">VI. Poverty Reduction and
Generation of Wealth<br>
</span><small><br>
</small></big>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
Government of Reconciliation and National Unity is in the process of
building a production model within which the reincorporation of small
and medium producers is an integral part of the National Development
Strategic. While the rights of private investors are respected and
protected and conditions are being created for the growth of big
business and large scale producers, the government coordinates programs
which benefit small and medium producers&nbsp; by means of self
sustaining economies of scale with the benefits of a fair market. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">The aim of these programs is to
reduce
poverty levels in the medium term.<br>
<br>
The principal lines of policy of the production strategy are; i) an
increase in national food production, ii) the promotion of the
agroindustrial process, iii) rational exploitation of natural
resources, iv) investment in production. <br>
<br>
The incorporation of greater added value within the productive chain
represents an important technological step forward as part of the
process of modernization
of the productive sector and the reduction of the commercial gap
between Nicaragua and the rest of the world. <br>
<br>
Private sector measures are required to satisfy the urgent need to
transform the electrical energy infrastructural
framework, to increase access to potable water, to explore oil fields
and to protect natural resources. Government measures are also required
to incorporate
those [private sector] actions in harmoney with the national production
strategy.<br>
</span></div>
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Here are some
of the main achievements so far as part of the
government's production strategy:</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>"Food for the People" Program - 1.35 million people
benefited with access to basic food products at below market prices</li>
<li>Provision of Seeds for Agro Food Production - 140,010
small
and medium farmers (48% more than in 2007) were provided with certified
seeds for basic grain production as part of this program</li>
<li>"Zero Hunger" Program - 19,709 rural families
benefited
with a food production package worth US$1,500 (56% more than in 2007)</li>
<li>"Zero Usury" Program - 20,174 female small business
owners
were benefited with low interest rate loans as part of this program in
2008. A total of C$139,837,150.17 has been awarded in low interest rate
loans as part of this program since 2007. A total of C$141,934,214.50
has been paid back on loans by beneficiaries, C$71,502,701.85 of which
has been loaned out again to new beneficiaries. </li>
<li>Credit and funding for Agriculture: Total credit for
agricultural production (from both public and private sources) in 2008
was C$4.465 billion 26% more than in 2007. On top of that, the
government channeled C$1.131 billion of donated resources to the
agricultural production sector, 130% more than in 2007. The interest
rate on loans for agricultural production has been reduced to 8% as a
result of the nation wide presence of ALBA Caruna branches providing
low interest rate loans to small and medium producers. ENABAS (the
national basic food company) bought 131,700 hundred weights of basic
grains for distribution as part of the "Food for the People Program." </li>
<li>Tourism: 857,480 tourists visited Nicaragua during
2008,
7.2% more than in 2007. A total of 389 micro, small and medium tourism
companies were benefited with low interest rate loans from ALBA Caruna.
</li>
<li>Support for MIPYMES: The government facilitated
training
courses and other forms of technical and professional support for
66,333 Micro, Small and Medium businesses (MIPYMEs) during 2008.</li>
</ul>
<big style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">VII.
Energy</big><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<small style="font-family: sans-serif;"><big><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrical Energy:</span><br>
</big></small>
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li><small><big>The price of electrical
energy for consumers of
less than 150kWh a month has remained the same (despite inevitably
volatile generation costs as a result of increasing oil prices) thanks
to a government subsidy. </big></small></li>
<li><small><big>As part of the government's
program to promote
and facilitate access to electricity in rural areas 23,000 homes will
be connected to the national grid between 2008 and 2010 benefitting
125,000 people. </big></small></li>
<li><small><big>As part of the government's
short term plan to
overcome energy shortages with the installation of petroleum based
generation plants, two plants (Hugo Chávez I and II) were
installed in 2007 and three more (Ernesto Che Guevara I, II and III) in
2008 generating a total of 180 MW. Another 100 MW will be generated
with the installation of a further four plants in 2009.</big></small></li>
<li><small><big>As part of the government's
medium term plan to
transform </big></small><small><big>the
electrical generation
infrastructural framework Nicaragua's first wind farm will begin to
operate in February 2009 generating 40 MW of energy. Other renewable
sourced energy generation projects with a total capacity of 856 MW and
a total cost of over US$2.1 billion are already in the first or second
phases of planning and construction. The government aim is that by </big></small><small><big>2014
only 12% of the electricity used in Nicaragua is generated from
petroleum derivatives. </big></small></li>
</ul>
<small style="font-family: sans-serif;"><big><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PETRONIC and
ALBANISA: <br>
</span></big></small>
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li><small><big>PETRONIC (the national
petroleum company)
almost doubled its storage capacity (from 551,000 to 1,033,105 barrels)
with the construction of two new storage facilities in Puerto Corinto.</big></small></li>
<li><small><big>Progress was made on the
design for the
Industrial Complex "Bolívar's Supreme Dream" (which consists of
an oil refinery and petrochemical plant capable of satisfying the
regional demand for petroleum derivatives and plastics).</big></small></li>
</ul>
<small style="font-family: sans-serif;"><big><br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">VIII.
Private Investment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big><br>
Direct Foreign Investment in Nicaragua increased by 42% from US$355.28
million in 2007 to US$505.83 million in 2008, which represents the
country's highest ever level of foreign investment. The three sectors
that attracted the majority of all direct foreign investment in 2008
were energy, telecommunications and Free Trade Zones. <br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">IX.

Foreign Policy:<br>
</small></span></big></big></small>
<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<li><small><big><big><small>Nicaragua's
candidate Miguel
D'Escoto Brockman was awarded the presidency of the UN General
Assembly's 63rd Session (2008 - 9).</small></big></big></small></li>
<li><small><big><big><small>At
the end of December President
Daniel Ortega took on the rotating presidency of SICA (Central American
Integration System). He will preside the regional organization for a
period of six months (January - June 2009).<br>
</small></big></big></small></li>
<li><small><big><big><small>Nicaragua
has contributed to the
promotion of certain national objectives on the regional agenda such as
