<a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Nicaraguas-Sandinista-Achievements-Baffle-World-Bank-IMF-20170831-0009.html">http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Nicaraguas-Sandinista-Achievem…</a></p>

<p>No one can take at face value any report, governmental or quasi non-governmental, coming out of imperial Washington’s echo-chamber bureaucracy. Ideological bias and institutional self-justification prevent these reports from giving a true account of virtually anything. The latest <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/365991498843795990/pdf/Nicaragua-SCD-Copyedit-final-jun-20-06272017.pdf">World Bank report on </a><a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/365991498843795990/pdf/Nicaragua-SCD-Copyedit-final-jun-20-06272017.pdf">Nicarag</a><a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/365991498843795990/pdf/Nicaragua-SCD-Copyedit-final-jun-20-06272017.pdf">ua</a> is no exception. The implicit but unstated truth in this report is that President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Front have achieved an unprecedented economic turnaround in just seven years, starting in 2010.</p>

<p>Reading the report, it is impossible to ignore the tension between latent ideological and political imperatives and the obligation to report the facts. Put another way, mild conflict clearly prevails between the World Bank’s Washington head office and its reality based local officials. From Washington, the tendency is both to minimize Daniel Ortega’s achievement and also to cover up the World Bank’s own lamentable history in Nicaragua. On the other hand, in Nicaragua, local World Bank staff dutifully report the facts as they see them.</p>

<p>A total of 71 people contributed to the report. Supposing those 71 people each worked for a month to prepare the research and say their average salary was about US$80,000, then <i>p</i><i>ro rata</i> a month’s work by that team cost over US$500,000, a very conservative guess. Even so, in summary, that money bought policy recommendations for Nicaragua’s development amounting to little more than : better infrastructure; better basic services; more private business investment; more efficient government; better targeted social policies. That’s it, for US$500,000 or more.</p>

<p>In general, the report recognizes Nicaragua’s achievements in reducing poverty and inequality, raising productivity, diversifying economic activity and promoting security and stability. The report’s 130 or so pages include, among the workmanlike economic and sociological analysis, many self-confessed guesses to fill in “knowledge gaps” and much gerry-mandered history to cover up what Harold Pinter in his <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture-e.html">2005 Nobel prize address</a> justly called “the tragedy of Nicaragua”. Pinter himself might have remarked the report is almost witty in its audacious, glib omissions. It acknowledges the catastrophic destructive effects of the decade long 1980s war in Nicaragua, but carefully omits the US government’s deliberate role in that destruction, now repeated against Syria and Venezuela.</p>

<p>The report retails humbug about a “democratic transition” starting in 1990. In fact, the Frente Sandinista organized the first free and fair democratic elections ever in Nicaragua in 1984, but the US government ordered the main Nicaraguan opposition to boycott them. Despite the war, Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Front won with 67% of the vote, very similar to the most recent presidential elections in 2016. The heavy ideological bias also explains the World Bank’s curious dating of when Nicaragua’s economic turnaround began, placing it firmly in the neoliberal era prior to 2007. But at just that time, the World Bank was cutting back the public sector as hard as they could, pushing, for example, to privatize Nicaragua’s public water utility and its education system,.</p>

<p>Back then, Nicaragua’s neglected electricity generating system collapsed through 2005 and 2006, incapable of generating even 400 megawatts a day, plunging swathes of Nicaragua back into the 19<sup>th</sup> century 10 and 12 hours at a time, day after day. That was the World Bank and IMF gift to Nicaragua after 17 years of so-called “democratic transition”. That period included Hurricane Mitch, devastating Nicaragua to the tune of 20% of GDP, only for the corrupt neoliberal government of the time to misuse hundreds of millions of dollars in disaster relief. The only structurally significant economic achievement of the neoliberal era in Nicaragua was substantial foreign debt relief.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/daniel_rosario.png" /></p>

<p>When President Ortega took office in January 2007, he faced four years of domestic crisis with an opposition controlled legislature persistently sabotaging his government’s programs. Through 2007-2008, Nicaragua and the whole region struggled vainly to contain balance of payments deficits against oil prices touching US$147 a barrel in 2008. That disaster was compounded by the collapse of the Western financial system through 2008 and 2009, a year when Nicaragua’s economy suffered a 3%. contraction. Only in 2010, did the Nicaraguan government finally enjoy domestic and international conditions stable enough to be able to consolidate and improve its social programs, improve infrastructure investment, democratize and diversify the economy, extend basic services, attract foreign investment….</p>

<p>If that sounds suddenly familiar, it should. It is exactly the development recipe offered up by this latest World Bank report, essentially an embellished review of policies the Nicaraguan government has already been implementing for a decade. Put positively, the government’s <a href="http://www.pndh.gob.ni/documentos/pndhActualizado/pndh.pdf">National Human Development Plan</a> and other <a href="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/compromisos_buen_gobierno_2017-2021.docx">relevant documents</a> suggest that the World Bank’s engagement with the Nicaraguan government has been one of mutual learning. So much so, that the current country program is likely to continue and may even expand.</p>

<p>The political opposition in Nicaragua have seized on parts of the report to try and rubbish the Sandinista government’s outstanding achievements. In fact, for seventeen years under neoliberal governments implementing World Bank and IMF policies, areas criticized like, for example, access to drinking water and adequate sanitation, or education, suffered chronic lack of investment, compounded by egregious waste and corruption. Now, the World Bank hypocritically criticizes Nicaragua’s Sandinista government for intractable policy difficulties the IMF and the World Bank themselves originally provoked.</p>

<p>Similarly, when the World Bank report criticizes the targeting of social programs, they omit the unquestionable success of the government’s Zero Usury microcredit program and the Zero Hunger rural family support program, both prioritizing women. These programs have lifted tens of thousands of families out of poverty and, along with unprecedented support for Nicaragua’s cooperative sector, radically democratized Nicaragua’s economy, especially for previously excluded rural families and women. That supremely important national process is entirely absent from the World Bank report.</p>

<p>In its discussions of almost all these issues, the report makes more or less detailed contributions, mostly already identified by the government itself. In every case, the underlying cause of problems or lack of progress, for example, on land titling or social security, has been the legacy of neoliberal governments between 1990 and 2007, reinstating elite privilege, rolling back the revolutionary gains of the 1980s and failing to guarantee necessary investment. The World Bank and the IMF were enthusiastic ideological partners in that endeavor. They would have continued their ideological offensive had not Daniel Ortega and his government dug in their heels in 2007 and 2008, backed up by investment support for social and productive programs from Venezuela as part of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas.</p>

<p>Since then, the World Bank, as this report suggests, seems, at least for the moment, to have learned two key lessons from President Ortega and his administration. In a world dominated by corporate elite globalization, their report implicitly recognizes the importance, firstly, of a mixed economy under strong central government and, secondly, the crucial role of broad dialog and consensus, across all sectors of society, to promote and sustain national stability. Essentially, the World Bank has acknowledged the undeniable success of the Sandinista Revolution’s socialist inspired, solidarity based policies, decisively prioritizing the needs of the human person over corporate profit and demonstrating the systemic inability of capitalism to meet those needs.</p>
