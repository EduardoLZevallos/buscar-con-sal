<em>Valdrack Jaentschke,<br />
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua</em></div>

<p><em><strong>In this article we offer a concise presentation of Nicaragua's progress in the field of Human Rights between 2008 and 2018 taken from the presentation of the State of Nicaragua in the Third Cycle of the United Nations Universal Periodic Review, made last May 15th in Geneva, Switzerland, by Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valdrack Jaentschke.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>These are hard facts, corroborated by international organizations. They speak for themselves, such that they cannot be ignored by anyone wishing to offer serious comment on the country's situation :</strong></em></p>

<p>In 2006, the population placed its trust in a new government, which, on a platform of National Reconciliation and Unity, set out to promote reconciliation between all political, economic and religious sectors and to implement a National Human Development Plan, in which Nicaraguan families are the main protagonists of government programs and identifying poverty as the main historical and structural problem to be eradicated.</p>

<p>A model of alliances was implemented between the government, small, medium and large productive-business sectors and workers, which, engaged in permanent dialogue, focusing on the search for consensus to move the country forward.</p>

<p>Since 2007, the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity has defined its policies through the formulation of its National Human Development Programs, currently being implemented for the period 2018-2021.</p>

<p>In 2015, Nicaragua became one of the first Latin American countries to meet Millennium Development Goal #1 by halving poverty and hunger, according to FAO and the UN World Food Programme (WFP).</p>

<p>Nicaragua met MDG #4 to reduce child mortality by two thirds. The country ranks 84th out of 193 countries that are meeting child mortality targets for 2030, with the index dropping from 17 in 2012 to 12.3 in 2018, according to UNICEF.</p>

<p>Inequality has decreased : Nicaragua's GINI Inequality Coefficient went from 0.38 to 0.33, an exemplary result, according to FAO.</p>

<p>Between 2014 and April 2018, Nicaragua maintained sustained economic growth of more than 5% annually, according to the World Bank, IMF and ECLAC; the third fastest growing economy in Latin America.</p>

<p>The Sandinista government has implemented more than 40 emblematic social programs and projects to fight poverty with direct results for the well-being of the population.</p>

<h3><strong>CITIZEN SECURITY</strong></h3>

<p>Nicaragua remains the safest country in Central America, and the third least violent country in Latin America.<br />
<br />
The homicide rate is 7.5 % per 100,000 inhabitants, which is 4 times less than the average in Central America. Only 6.3% of crimes represent highly dangerous crimes.</p>

<p>The World Economic Forum ranks Nicaragua as one of the only countries in the Continent with a score of less than 1 in the indicators of Crime and Robbery, which facilitates business, obtaining the best evaluation of the continent (5.7).</p>

<p>The 2015 Latinobarómetro survey indicates that crime in Latin America has grown 360% in the last 20 years, while in Nicaragua, it has been steadily reduced by 43% in the last 7 years.</p>

<p>The Regional Human Development Report 2014 of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recognizes that the National Police has consolidated a model of public security with a community profile.</p>

<p>With regard to access to justice, the constitutional reform of 2014 strengthened judicial independence, creating the National Council of Administrative and Judicial Careers, with autonomous authority to regulate the judicial career administration, carrying out 18 selection processes for 637 public servants and ratifying 409 civil servants through performance evaluations.</p>

<p>The "Family Code" (Law No. 870) was approved and implemented and entered into force in April 2015.</p>

<p>The new Code of Civil Procedure of the Republic of Nicaragua (Law No. 902) has been in force since 10 April 2016.</p>

<p>Accession to the Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance was approved on 28 August 2018.</p>

<p>Seventy-five Judicial Centres specializing in the family, violence and adolescents, the System of Judicial Facilitators and Facilitators and the Institute of Legal Medicine (IML) with its Women's and Children's Clinics, and the DNA Laboratory were expanded and strengthened.</p>

<p>The Judicial Observatory on Gender Violence was strengthened to follow up and monitor precautionary and preventive measures, judicial decisions and judicial statistics relating to crimes of violence against women, as defined in Law 779.</p>

<p>The "Regulations of the Specialized Criminal Justice System for Adolescents", the "Manual for Public Defence in Matters involving Adolescents" and the "Protocol for Action by the Specialized Prosecutor in Criminal Justice for Adolescents" were implemented.</p>

<p>There were 609 conciliations and agreements, representing approximately 14 per cent of the total accusations, as alternative measures to the resolution of conflicts in criminal matters.</p>

<p>The National Police set up two training centres that provide specialized care for children, adolescents and young people at risk, providing training for 13,072 young people. These centres are the only ones of their kind in Central America.</p>

<p>167,009 expert investigations have been conducted of crimes against women's lives and integrity. A total of 69,605 criminal cases have been processed and 62 per cent have been resolved.</p>

<p>For the crime of femicide, 65 sentences were handed down with a guilty verdict, demonstrating the rigorous application of Law 779, "Comprehensive Law against Violence against Women".</p>

<p>In 2015, Law No. 896 against trafficking of persons was enacted, harmonized with legislation in Central America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>The National Coalition against Trafficking of Persons, which brings together 25 government agencies and non-governmental organizations, was strengthened and carried out 8,619 preventive and educational activities for 467,863 persons and the training of 44,232 public officials.</p>

<h3><strong>CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS</strong></h3>

<p>There is absoutely complete freedom of expression in the country.</p>

<p>The diversity of the media is reflected in the written, radio and television media that belong to the private sector and that broadcast programing and communications without any restriction.</p>

<p>Nicaragua recognizes and guarantees the right of assembly, demonstration and public mobilization of people, and like any other country, these rights must be exercised in accordance with the laws and regulations established for this purpose.</p>

<p>The electoral rights of the Nicaraguan people are guaranteed by the Constitution and its reforms, as well as in other laws.</p>

<p>The Law on Equal Rights and Opportunities seeks to ensure greater participation, inclusion, representation and gender equity, guaranteeing proportionality of 50% between women and men in all positions of popular election and government representation.</p>

<p>The Political Constitution provides that the lists of candidates for popularly elected posts must consist of fifty per cent men and fifty per cent women, ordered equitably and presented alternately.</p>

<p>The gender perspective is applied in all policies, plans, programmes and legal regulations to guarantee women's rights and full participation in decision-making in national life.</p>

<p>Nicaragua ranks sixth in the gender equity index, first in the Americas; fifth in women's participation in parliament; and first in ministerial positions.</p>

<p>In the 2018 World Economic Forum's "Global Gender Gap" index, Nicaragua has risen from 62nd to fifth place, achieving an 80.9% reduction in inequality between men and women.</p>

<p>Women in general represent:<br />
<br />
        * 59.7% in the Judicial Branch,<br />
        * 56% in the Executive Branch,<br />
        * 45.7% in the National Assembly,<br />
        * 46% of all Mayors,<br />
        * 60% of all Vice Mayors and<br />
        * 50% of all Councilwomen,</p>

<p>Women hold many of the most important positions in the State and Government, including: the Vice President of the Republic, the Presidency of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Vice President of the National Assembly, the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, the Office of the Procurator for the Defence of Human Rights and the Mayoress of the capital city, Managua.</p>

<p>In the executive branch, 9 of the 16 central ministries (56.3 per cent) are headed by women, to which are added 7 of 16 deputy ministers (43.8 per cent). 14 of the 31 Decentralized Entities (45.1%) are headed by women.</p>

<p>In Other Powers and State Entities, women occupy 57% of the Executive Board of the National Assembly, 40% of the Magistrates of the Supreme Electoral Council, 31% of the Magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, 50% of the Comptrollers General and 57% of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank.</p>

<p>In the 2016 general elections, as well as in the 2017 municipal elections and the 2014 elections for Regional Councils of Indigenous and Afro-descendant Peoples, the free, direct and secret participation of the Nicaraguan people in the exercise of their right to vote was guaranteed through 19 legally registered political parties.</p>

<p>Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra obtained 72.44% of the votes in the 2016 presidential elections. These electoral processes were accompanied by the OAS and other national and international actors.</p>

<p>Progress was made in the national identity card process, increasing by 17.74% the number of citizens accredited with identity cards to participate in the 2017 municipal electoral process.</p>

<p>The number of polling centers  (JRVs), both urban and rural, increased by 2.0%, from 12,960 JRVs in the 2011 general elections to 13,206 in the 2017 municipal electoral process.</p>

<p>According to its latest ranking of March 2019, from a prestigious international consulting firm (Mitofsky), Commander Daniel Ortega ranks fourth among the best evaluated presidents in the Latin American region (55%) and the best evaluated by his citizens with respect to the other Central American Presidents.</p>
