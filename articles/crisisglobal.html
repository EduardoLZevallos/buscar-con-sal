of Central America meet to analyze appropriate response to US financial

On October 4 the Presidents of the member countries of the System of
Central American Integration, SICA, (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica) met in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa to
discuss the US financial crisis, its impact on the region and an
appropriate regional response to minimize the inevitable damage likely
to&nbsp;the Central American economies. The meeting was called at
very short notice in response to the unfolding collapse of the US
financial system.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
A study carried out by financial experts of the region about the
possible impact of the financial crisis on the region was presented at
the presidential meeting. The study predicts substantial reductions in
family remittances sent by Central American emigrants working in the
US, a sharp decrease in Central American exports, (over 50% of which
are sold to the US), and a steep fall in the number of US investors
looking to invest in Central America. The report recommended that
governments invest in basic food production and infrastructural works
and implement all other available measures aimed at generating
employment and economic activity.<br>
<br>
After discussing the potentially catastrophic implications of the
collapse of the US financial system, the SICA presidents signed a
declaration in which it was agreed that efforts should be focused on
strengthening trade within Central America and other existing
alternative markets (like those certain countries in the region
already&nbsp;have with Venezuela, China and the Caribbean
Community, CARICOM) and on opening new markets, for example with the
European Union and MERCOSUR (Common Market of South America). In order
to establish trade links as a regional block with other countries and
regions of the world it was agreed that vital&nbsp; integration
mechanisms like the Central American Customs Union be consolidated as
soon as possible.<br>
<br>
The need to seek new lines of credit was also emphasized. One
possibility mentioned here was the Banco del Sur, which was set up
recently with capital from South American countries in order to provide
alternative lines of credit for developing countries. Currently, the
Banco del Sur is still mired in negotiations over its role and
institutional management<br>
<br>
It was agreed that an emergency fund of US$2,000 million would be
requested from the Central American Economic Integration Bank to help
the region's governments and banking systems deal with the imminent
financial fall out. US$200 million of this fund would be loaned to the
Central Banks of each SICA country to help the institutions deal with
insolvency within the financial system. Another US$200 million would be
loaned to private banks in each country so as to be made available for
social projects and productive activities.<br>
<br>
The SICA presidents also agreed to instruct their Agricultural
Ministers to draft a concrete plan to promote regional food production
and distribution with the aim of avoid food shortages as a result of
the medium and long term consequences of the economic fall out. <br>
<br>
Finally it was agreed that another SICA presidential meeting would be
held in November for the presentation of a regional financial plan in
the light of the unfolding US financial collapse. This plan is
currently being drafted by SICA's Economic Integration Ministerial
Council.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Below is a translation of extracts from the press conference given
after the presidential meeting, as transcribed by the Nicaraguan
government:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega:</span> I think that this meeting has
been an appropriate [medium] to tackle the issue of this global crisis,
generated by the mechanisms put in place by capitalism and its own
economic policies. ... The crisis, seen most clearly in the New York
stock exchange in the US, is no more than the manifestation of the
disease suffered by the system. The system is terminally ill! And now
that even the US President is talking about reviewing the [way the]
system [works], ... we should be more than convinced that [capitalism]
is not the path, this is the not the option which will permit people to
enjoy the fundamental principles of the [UN Universal] Declaration of
Human Rights.<br>
<br>
Logically, today we have spoken about the crisis. It was the main theme
[of the&nbsp;meeting], but we have also spoken about other matters
like SICA's different mechanisms, ... the normal functions of the
different instruments that the Central American community has, and how
to use these instruments, the institutions at our disposal, in the
middle of this crisis so as to defend, strengthen and develop Central
America's capacities.<br>
<br>
We have agreed ... to strengthen the regional [internal Central
American] market. For Nicaragua the Central American market is the
first [most important] market, the US market is the second [most
important] market. And now we are opening a very important market
within the ALBA framework, where Venezuela is becoming an enormously
important market for our country. A market based on the concept of fair
trade where the asymmetries of our countries are taken into account.
This is something inconceivable for the developed countries. The
developed countries, the US and European countries, they do not
understand about asymmetries! They talk about free trade, but they
don't practice it. They prefer implementing protectionist policies
which are detrimental to the economies of developing
countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
What is happening in the US [at the moment] is really the biggest
economic crisis the planet has seen, it is the result of policies of
greed, of the individualism that capitalism [provokes], and it obliges
us to think hard and take action. [It obliges us] to realize that we
cannot depend on one market, especially when that market does not take
into account our asymmetries, because if that market fails ... as it is
doing, then we become victims. ...<br>
<br>
[The recently passed US government bailout] of the forces of capital
which provoked this crisis is totally ridiculous, absurd. But then [the
bailout itself] is a manifestation of the characteristics of the
system. This type of measure is transient, it is not a solution, ... it
is just a plaster which is being put on a very deep wound... We must
not put trust [in this sort of measure] because the tendencies are
dangerous, we do not know how far this crisis will go, this crisis
which affects the global economy and has a direct impact on us. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Honduran President
Manuel Zelaya:</span> The attendance of the presidents today
speaks very well about the [integration of the] Central American
region, especially when there are urgent matters to which we have to
give joint answers, not unilateral answers. ...<br>
<br>
[During the meeting] we were able to draft a document ... about the
need to homogenize economic, trade and social policies within Central
America in order to provide solutions to the people of Central America,
to our communities, with regard to the international economic crisis,
which we know is affecting us, but as time goes on its impact will be
felt more and more by our governments, our people and the entire
productive apparatus of Central America.<br>
<br>
That is why the document ends with very clear conclusions. We are not
committed only to global capitalism's commercial operations. We know
that the licentiousness of capitalism ... provokes corruption within
the system, and we must combat it with all the mechanisms of control
necessary for our countries.<br>
<br>
But as regards all those commercial, social and economic activities,
the Presidents, Vice Presidents and their Ministers of Central America
here today have a very clear mandate. So therefore we want turn the
international economic crisis into an opportunity for Central America.<br>
<br>
We want to make Central America an attractive place for investors and
development [projects], while at the same time demonstrating
responsible governance which provides prompt solutions to its people in
the areas of education, health care and other social spheres. We have
instructed our ministers to come up with a plan to this end over the
coming weeks, which will be presented to the public.<br>
<br>
President Elias Saca of El Salvador, representative of a far right
government with troops in Iraq, was asked whether, given that the need
to take advantage of concessional programs such as Petrocaribe was
confirmed during the meeting, the government of El Salvador is
considering joining the Venezuelan promoted regional integration
project.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">President Elias
Saca:</span> We consider that one of the most important measures
[in light of the US financial crisis], apart from the food production
plan, ... is to continue to broaden our trade links [with other
countries and regions]....<br>
<br>
Today we have spoken at length about our commercial relations with
other regions. SICA has always been open to trade links with all
regions, South America, the Caribbean, North America, etc. ...<br>
<br>
El Salvador respects each country's decision with regards to a
commercial agreement, a petroleum or social agreement with the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. We respect that. But in El Salvador's
case, the state does not import petroleum, nor does it buy petroleum,
nor refined gasoline. and at the moment, El Salvador is not considering
incorporating itself into Petrocaribe.<br>
<br>
President of Costa Rica, the pragmatic center right politician Oscar
Arias, was asked whether his government is considering joining
Petrocaribe, given that the overriding vision to come out of the
meeting was based on the need to look to the South for solutions to the
devastating repercussions which the financial crisis may inflict on the
region.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">President Arias:</span>
Yes we are considering our incorporation into Petrocaribe. We consider
[Petrocaribe] to be a very important project which permits countries
that import petroleum from Venezuela access to generous credit over 25
years with 1% interest.<br>
<br>
For many years Costa Rica's answer [to a potentially unstable global
economy] was not to look to the South, but to look in all directions,
to look to all continents and to diversify its market. The US is our
most important economic partner. ... Central America is also an
important partner. But our second most important partner is China. Once
Central America finishes the negotiations of the association agreement
with the European Union, our aim in Costa Rica is to start to negotiate
a free trade agreement with China.<br>
