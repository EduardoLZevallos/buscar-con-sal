<strong>WEBINAR: ALLIANCE FOR GLOBAL JUSTICE - THE WORLD STANDS UP TO SANCTIONS<br />
<br />
SPEECH BY AMBASSADOR FRANCISCO CAMPBELL<br />
<br />
JANUARY 23RD, 2022</strong></p>

<p>The heightened hostility and systematic aggression of the United States and its imperialist allies against the People of Nicaragua, is the continuation of a policy carried out against our country throughout history and a reminder that interventionism in Nicaragua is one of the most persistent manifestations of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>As early as 1823 when the United States enacted the Monroe Doctrine - its guiding policy framework to exert influence in Latin America and the Caribbean - interventionism in the affairs of Nicaragua became a constant of US policy; from the signing of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850 regarding control of the proposed Nicaragua Canal, to outright recognition in 1856 of William Walker, a U.S. mercenary, as President of Nicaragua, who went on to reinstate slavery and seek annexation to the United States.</p>

<p>This interventionist policy included deployment of marines to overthrow President José Santos Zelaya in 1910 and military assistance to conservative General Emiliano Chamorro in the 1912 assassination of General Benjamín Zeledon, who had opposed U.S. interference in Nicaragua.<br />
 <br />
The United States Marines occupied Nicaragua from 1912 until 1933, when they were expelled by our National Hero, the “General of Free Men,” Augusto Calderón Sandino, who was assassinated in an ignominious act of betrayal by General Anastasio Somoza García in 1934, with the permission and backing of the U.S. Ambassador at the time.  </p>

<p>The brutal Somoza dictatorship had the full support of every U.S. President from Franklin Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter. All of these Presidents, Democrats and Republicans, turned a blind eye to the gross human rights violations committed by the dictator and facilitated the looting of the natural resources of the country, along with exploitation of the vast majority of the People.</p>

<p>After 43 years of terror and systematic human rights violations, the Somoza dictatorship finally came to an end when his National Guard was defeated by the Sandinista Revolution in 1979, marking the beginning of democracy in Nicaragua for the first time in the history of the country.</p>

<p>This revolutionary democratic victory for the People of Nicaragua, was soon subverted when U.S. interventionism returned in the form of the contra war that caused over 50,000 deaths and completely destroyed the economy, along with systematic interference since 1990 in the Nicaragua electoral processes through corrupt, antidemocratic, and blatantly illegal practices.</p>

<p>Immediately following the victory of Comandante Daniel Ortega and the FSLN in the 2006 elections, the U.S. government renewed its aggression against Nicaragua in the form of financial, technical and intelligence assets and resources amounting to several hundred million dollars, that were channeled through a few dozen individuals and local NGO´s for the purpose of establishing anti-Sandinista and anti-Government media structures and campaigns to instigate dissent and violence in urban and rural areas, as well as advocate for illegal and unilateral measures against the Nicaraguan People in flagrant violation of Nicaragua laws and basic Principles of International Law.</p>

<p>The 2018 coup attempt was the culmination of this policy of aggression. It cost the lives of 198 Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers and countless others injured; 1 in 4 small businesses were closed because of the impact that barricading of roads and highways had on the economy; 98,000 jobs were lost, and the overall damage to the national economy was estimated at over US 27 billion dollars.</p>

<p>The People of Nicaragua were able to defeat the coup by calling-to-memory the shared history of struggle against US interventionism. The profound sense of national dignity, patriotism and pride was in full display against this new attempt by the local oligarchy and US neocolonialist to subjugate Nicaragua. The Nicaragua Model of Participatory Democracy, “the People President”, proved its mettle in this most recent confrontation and has been strengthened through the celebration of regional elections in 2019 and national elections in November of last year.    </p>

<p>Overcoming the effects of the coup attempt, Nicaragua has returned to the path of integral, comprehensive economic growth, maintaining key social programs that have allowed the country to reduce poverty, ensure free and universal quality health care and education, citizen security and food sovereignty. The building of infrastructure in the form of highways, hospitals, and schools as well as access to basic services, reducing vulnerability to the worsening effects of climate change, all attest to the growing strength and resilience of the Nicaragua Model of Human Development and Participatory Democracy, which ensures that all sectors of society have a voice in the building of a more prosperous and diverse nation, aiming to eradicate poverty, hunger and inequality and prioritizing gender equity in all areas as one of its foundational components.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is the best performing Central American country in terms of handling of the COVID19 pandemic, which is a direct result of Comandante Ortega´s commitment to ensure access to free, quality healthcare services for all and a reflection of the confidence the Nicaraguan People have in their Family and Community Centered Health Model.<br />
<br />
As an expression of the steadfast and unwavering determination to defend and exercise our right to National Sovereignty, Self-determination, and Independence, Nicaragua has reestablished ties with the People´s Republic of China, a Permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council, and began the process of withdrawing from the Organization of American States (OAS). These strategic decisions will undoubtedly open new avenues and possibilities for Nicaragua to move ahead in its commitment to achieve integral, comprehensive development with social justice for all. Because of these achievements and the good example they represent, Nicaragua is seen as a threat to US foreign policy that through illegal coercive and unilateral measures seeks to perpetuate neocolonial domination and exploitation. As of 2022, almost 2 billion people from over 40 countries are being denied the right to development due to these illegal sanctions, which in times of pandemic and as we grapple with the effects of climate change, is nothing short of a crime against humanity.</p>

<p>Nicaragua maintains that the only legal sanctions are those of the United Nation Security Council and has demanded that all unilateral, coercive, and illegal measures imposed on our country, or any other country be immediately eliminated.</p>

<p>The firm pronouncement that “Sanctions Kill” must be made to resonate loudly throughout the world because of the immense suffering and destruction they are causing. It is imperative that all sanctions be eliminated, allowing our countries the space and resources needed to effectively address the myriad of challenges to overcome, in our efforts to build more just and fair societies with opportunities and benefits for all.</p>

<p>This is the purpose and goal of the successful Nicaragua Participatory Democracy Model, also known as “The People President”, that was reaffirmed by the overwhelming vote of the Nicaraguan people in the November 7th elections, granting a new five-year term which formally began this past January 10th, when President Ortega and Vice president Murillo were sworn into office.</p>

<p>The struggle continues and we are confident that justice in the end will prevail!</p>
