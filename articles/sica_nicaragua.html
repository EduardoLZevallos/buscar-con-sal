Nicaragua defended
regional interests during its SICA presidency</big><br>
<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">By
Karla Jacobs, 10th June 2009</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This month,
Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will hand over the pro tempore presidency of
the Central American Integration System (SICA) to Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias. It is timely, therefore, to take a brief look at the
advances made within the regional integration system during Nicaragua's
six month presidency.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Undeniably
Ortega's&nbsp;most important achievements as president of SICA have
been to oversee the unification of regional positions at a number of
international forums and to increase the speed and effectiveness with
which the region has responded to different threats or problems faced
either by the region in general or by individual countries.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
are two clear examples of how, during the last six months, Central
America has presented itself, perhaps for the first time, as a force to
be reckoned with on the international diplomatic scene.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Central
America commands greater respect from US government</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
what was regarded as an attempt to undermine Ortega's SICA presidency
in an attitude of blatant disregard for SICA's institutional framework,
US Vice President Joe Biden arranged an encounter with Central American
leaders through regional pro-US, anti-integration champion Oscar Arias,
president of Costa Rica. The meeting took place in late March as part
of Biden's pre-Summit of the Americas (Port of Spain) diplomatic tour.
Neither Ortega nor Honduran President Manuel Zelaya attended the Costa
Rican meeting in protest against the way it was organized.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">During
a previous extraordinary SICA presidents meeting called by Ortega the
region's position on diverse issues going into the Port of Spain summit
had been discussed and defined. Among the numerous points included in
the declaration signed at the meeting were several observations
vís-a-vís the meeting with Biden in San José. The most important of
which insisted that </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">diplomatic
exchange and&nbsp;regional organizations are the legitimate
channels
through which bilateral and multilateral agendas
between&nbsp;Central
America and the US should be discussed and analyzed.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Most
commentators agree that the disciplined unanimity of the regional
leaders' &nbsp;- apart from</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> Oscar Arias -</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
disapproval of Biden's failure to respect&nbsp;the SICA framework
was
the impetus that obliged Barack Obama to call another encounter with
the same leaders, this time using the established diplomatic channels,
during the Port of Spain summit.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Unity
and discipline force EU to consider Common Credit Fund&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Significant
advances have been made in the negotiation of an Association Agreement
between SICA and the European Union (EU) since January. Most notably,
Nicaragua has succeeded in convincing other regional governments to
close ranks around the insistence that, unless the Europeans agree to
the inclusion of a Common Credit Fund as part of the Association
Agreement, no agreement of any kind would be signed.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
Common Credit Fund, a multi-million dollar fund financed mostly with EU
capital, would provide Central American countries with
significant&nbsp;financial resources for development. According to
the
Nicaraguan government, the Credit Fund would permit Central American
countries' small and fragile economies to begin to overcome the severe
disadvantages they have compared to EU countries as part of the Free
Trade Agreement included in the Association Agreement.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
was during an extraordinary meeting of SICA presidents that took place
in Managua on May 20th that the regional leaders defined their position
with regards to Nicaragua's proposal. As a result representatives of
the EU delegation in charge of the negotiations with Central America
have been forced to change their "absolutely unthinkable" rhetoric for
promises to take part in a mixed commission studying possible
mechanisms of implementation of the Common Fund.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Guatemalan
crisis and AH1N1 flu : sound regional responses led by Nicaragua</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
is much on which to base the argument that Nicaragua's SICA presidency
has provided the region with an example of how effectively regional
governments can work together to counteract common problems and threats.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">During
the May 20th meeting the regional presidents signed a Special
Declaration about Guatemala referring to the increasing levels of
violence as part of "an ongoing destabilization campaign by
representatives of organized crime." The regional leaders "expressed
full support for the Guatemalan government and "condemned the crimes
and violent acts against Guatemalan citizens which aim to undermine the
constitutional government."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
addition of SICA's expression of support for the Guatemalan government
to those of the OAS and the Río Group helped President Alvaro Colom
maintain his presidential legitimacy in the face of a ruthless
destabilization campaign&nbsp;by opposition forces.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">AH1N1 influenza
alert</span><br>
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Another
example of a sound regional response was provided in late April when
international concern spread about the the threat of an imminent
pandemic caused by the AH1N1 influenza virus. Ortega called an
emergency meeting of the region's health ministers which took place on
April 28th in Managua. During the meeting a set of preventative
measures to be implemented uniformly throughout the region was agreed
upon. Other agreements included the negotiation and purchase of
anti-viral drugs as a region and a regional request for emergency funds
from the Panamerican Health Organization.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
are numerous other examples of less news worthy advances during
Ortega's six month presidency, specifically in areas like food
security, social housing, environmental protection and sustainable
rural development which were highlighted as priorities by the
Nicaraguan authorities. The so-called CA-4 countries - El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua - have already largely
eliminated customs and immigration controls so as to
facilitate movement of goods and people in the region. Costa Rica has
resolutely refused to participate.<br>
<br>
The
rejection by Costa Rica and its President Oscar Arias of determined
moves towards regional integration may slow down the process for the
period of the Costa Rican pro tempore SICA presidency. But President
Daniel Ortega's achievements, and before him the efforts
of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, have definitely made regional
integration a much greater priority for other governments in Central
America. <br>
<br>
Although
Arias' six months pro-tempore presidency of SICA is likely to represent
a setback in terms of the Central American integration process, the
fact that Ortega and his colleagues have shown the benefits of a
determined projection and defense of Central America's regional
positions and interests in major international forums is not something
that will be readily marginalised or undermined in future.</span><br>
