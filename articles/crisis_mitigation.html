      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It is always difficult to
know if
one's own perception of the state of things is
representative of that of the majority of the population in the
area or country where one lives. So many unknowns and
variables can positively or negatively affect the lives of different
parts of the population.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In as much as any subjective
perception
is valuable in terms of evaluating the national situation, though,
there is no reason why life in the rural farming community where I
live should be significantly easier than the average campesino
experience in Nicaragua. The impression I have of my family's and
friends' lives, is that, things have not changed dramatically for
better or for worse since the onslaught of the worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It is true, I do not live in an
area
affected by a wave of sudden mass dismissals due to the closure of
free trade zone factories. If I did this article may well have been
written&nbsp;very differently. But, a brief analysis of the
recent economic and social indicators confirms that the
international economic crisis has not by any means provoked what could be described
as a devastating impact on the Nicaraguan economy. <br>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Since the crisis began to affect
the national economy during the second half of 2008 exports have not
fallen as much as some analysts anticipated thanks to newly established
trade links with countries like Venezuela and Russia. Despite a
significant reduction in the value of overall exports during the second
semester of 2008 and the first few months of 2009, the figure is still
higher than in 2007, and since April this year has actually begun to
ascend again Simultaneuosly, Nicaragua's trade deficit has been reduced
significantly compared to last year and slightly compared to two years
ago (see table below).<br>

sign that the government's economic policy is proving to be far more
prudent than the opposition would have us believe is that, despite the
Treasury Ministry being obliged to take US$40 million from Nicaragua's
international reserves in January in order to cover the budget deficit
created as a result of European countries' decision to suspend a
certain amount of aid,&nbsp;the country's reserves have since recovered
and superseded the level registered in December 2008. At the end of
2008 the country's international reserves were worth US$1,141
million.&nbsp;By July 15th 2009 this figure had risen to US$1,178
million according to a <a href="http://www.bcn.gob.ni/publicaciones/prensa/Presentacion_jul_09.pdf">recent Central Bank publication</a>.<br><br>In
order to measure the extent to which ordinary Nicaraguan have been
affected by the impact of the international economic crisis, and
consequentially, how the crisis may have affected the government's
popular support, it is important to bear in mind that the majority of
the population pays little attention to the relentless smear campaign
against everything the government does, promoted by the corporate media
and the opposition parties. Someone observing Nicaragua from outside
the country with access only to the Nicaraguan corporate media's
version of reality, could be forgiven for thinking that the country's
economy is on its knees and that widespread and passionate opposition
to the government is growing.&nbsp; <br><br>The way most Nicaraguans
measure their well-being, though, is almost entirely based on their day
to day experience - whether or not they have access to some form of
employment, to what extent their income covers the cost of living,
whether their kids are able to attend school, to what extent they are
able to overcome ill health, whether the basic infrastructure they
depend on (roads, transport, electricilty, sanitation) is in a better
or worse state that last year, etc.<br><br>With this in mind, one of
the most significant and damaging impacts of the crisis has been the
closure of a number of transnational owned factories in Nicaragua's
Free Trade Zones resulting in the loss of over 20,000 jobs.
Nevertheless, the record levels of direct foreign investment recorded
in Nicaragua since 2007, along with the government's successful policy
of making credit available for micro and small enterprise and
agricultural production have, to a large certain extent, mitigated what
would otherwise have threatened to become a dramatic unemployment
crisis. <br><br>As is demonstrated in the table below, the number of
workers registered with the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute, INSS
(which includes all public employees and workers employed by publicly
registered enterprises) has steadily increased each year since 2006.
(The 2009 average is based on monthly figures published until May of
this year). <br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><small>Number of employees registered with INSS <br><span style="font-weight: normal;">(thousands) </span><br></small></div><br><table style="width: 30%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>2006</small></td><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>420.3</small></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>2007</small></td><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>459.0</small></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>2008</small></td><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>493.4</small></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>2009</small></td><td style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;"><small>498.3</small></td></tr></tbody></table><br><div style="text-align: center;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">source: </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.bcn.gob.ni/estadisticas/basedatos/demoFrameset.html">Central Bank</a></small></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>It
is a well known fact that the great majority of Nicaraguan workers
work&nbsp;in the informal sector, and therefore will mostly not be
registered
with the INSS. Obviously it is&nbsp;much more difficult to measure the
number of informal sector workers. As part of President Daniel Ortega's
2008 end of year report, however, official figures demonstrating the
impact of government coordinated programs aimed at
facilitating&nbsp;work within the informal sector were published.<br><br>The
table below shows the number of direct and indirect jobs created as a
result of the four main government coordinated informal sector support
programs in 2007 and 2008. (As yet the government has not presented the
relevant figures for 2009 but the programs have continued to benefit
large numbers of informal sector workers during the first eight months
of 2009).&nbsp; <br><br><table style="width: 80%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Direct permanent jobs</small></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Indirect temporary jobs</small></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Accumulated</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Zero Hunger</small></td><td><small>48,802</small></td><td><small>97,604</small></td><td><small>146,406</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Credit for small farmers</small></td><td><small>199,438</small></td><td><small>398,876</small></td><td><small>593,314</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Zero Usury</small></td><td><small>71,526</small></td><td></td><td><small>71,526</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Credit for small tourism enterprises</small></td><td><small>6,378</small></td><td></td><td><small>6,378</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Total </small></td><td><small>326,144</small></td><td><small>496,480</small></td><td><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">822,624</span></small></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>source: </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.conamornicaragua.org.ni/DOCUMENTOS%202009/ENERO/INFORME%20DE%20PERSPECTIVAS%20SOCIALES%20TODO.pdf">Presidential 2008 annual report</a></small></div><br>In
terms of the extent to which workers' salaries have maintained their
value during the last couple of years, Central Bank figures show that
the real value of private sector workers' wages (in relation to the US
dollar) was devalued significantly during 2008 but during the first
four months of 2009 restored and superseded its value compared to 2007.
(The significant volatility of the US dollar over the last
five or six years, however, makes it difficult to gauge the real change in
purchasing power of Nicaraguan salaries.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

way in which the government has successfully reduced the potentially
devastating effects of the crisis for ordinary people is by reducing
the government's administration costs and the amount spent servicing
the public debt (thanks to the renegotiation of the onerous
internal&nbsp;debt) and increasing social spending (see table below).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Functional structure of central government spending</span><br>(US$ millions)</small></div><table style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>2006</small></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>2007</small></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>2008</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Social spending</small></td><td><small>587.6</small></td><td><small>668.4</small></td><td><small>781.5</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Government administration</small></td><td><small>204.5</small></td><td><small>146.4</small></td><td><small>172.8</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Public debt</small></td><td><small>115.0</small></td><td><small>96.7</small></td><td><small>74.6</small></td></tr></tbody></table><br><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: center;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">source: </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.bcn.gob.ni/estadisticas/basedatos/demoFrameset.html">Central Bank</a><br></small></div></div><br>Figures
for 2009 are as yet unavailable. It is important to point out, however,
that, since the beginning of 2009, the government has implemented a
rigid policy of austerity involving all State institutions aimed at
significantly reducing administration costs in order not to reduce
spending on critical areas like health and education.&nbsp; <br><br>One
consistent characteristic of the FSLN government's management of funds
has been its ability to do more with less. The government is pretty
much
obliged to maintain an economic program with the IMF in order to
guarantee the liquidity it needs to carry out its program. In doing so,
however, its sovereignty over the budget details is, to a certain
extent, limited. <br><br>One example of how the government is able to
do significantly more than previous neo-liberal governments in areas
like health and education is how, with only slight increases in the
percentage of the GDP spent on those sectors, a significantly larger
amount per capita is spent on the population making use of those
services&nbsp;(see table below). This is possible thanks to public
sector policies like a limit on salaries for top positions and a
general reduction in government bureaucracy.&nbsp; <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Government spending on health and education</span></small></div><table style="width: 70%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>2004</small></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>2005</small></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>2007</small></td><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>2008</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>% of GDP spent on education</small></td><td><small>4.4</small></td><td><small>4.7</small></td><td><small>5.0</small></td><td><small>5.3</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>amount (US$) spent per student</small></td><td><small>79.8</small></td><td><small>92.2</small></td><td><small>164.3</small></td><td><small>203.1</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>% of GDP spent on healthcare</small></td><td><small>3.2</small></td><td><small>3.4</small></td><td><small>3.7</small></td><td><small>3.7</small></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;"><small>amount (US$) spent per cápita</small></td><td><small>24.9</small></td><td><small>29.1</small></td><td><small>37.8</small></td><td><small>41.6</small></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><small style="font-style: italic;"><br>source: </small><small><a style="font-style: italic;" href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/www.bcn.gob.ni">Central Bank</a></small> </div><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;">When
considering the impact government coordinated programs are having on
the Nicaraguan population, it is essential to bare in mind that the
social spending registered within the budget represents only a part of
the overall funding for social projects managed by the government.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: left;">Thanks
to&nbsp;Nicaragua's membership of the regional energy integration
program Petrocaribe, made possible thanks to the Venezuelan government,
50% of the value of petroleum imported from Venezuelan company PDVSA
(equivalent to 5.9 million barrels in 2008) is made available as a
loan to be paid back over 25 years with 1% annual interest. The funds
made available (over US$270 million in 2008) are used for different
social and infrastructure projects.</p><br>The petroleum is imported by
ALBANISA, a mixed company of Nicaraguan and Venezuelan capital, which
also manages the social project funds in accordance with conditions set
by Petrocaribe's 19 regional governments. So far in Nicaragua the funds
have been used to carry out a vast array of projects including housing
projects, a nationwide literacy campaign, local infrastructure projects
(neighbourhood roads, bridges, sewers, etc.) and the provision of low
interest loans for small enterprise and agricultural production. <br><br>It
is thanks&nbsp;to Nicaragua's involvement in the regional integration
initiatives ALBA and Petrocaribe that the government has had the
resources with which to implement its food sovereignty and security
policy so successfully. <br><br>The reactivation of ENABAS (the State
company responsible for guaranteeing basic food supply)&nbsp;since 2007 has had an increasing
presence&nbsp;across the country, enabling the company to exercise
growing influence on basic grain markets resulting in much greater
stability of both the price paid to basic grain producers and the price
paid by consumers. <br><br>Low interest rate&nbsp;loans-in-kind of
certified seeds and fertilizer provided by, among others, the Rural
Development Institute and the Ministry of Agriculture, along with
guaranteed purchase and fixed price agreements with ENABAS have
permitted tens of thousands of small and medium farmers to increase
yields and reinsert themselves as players into&nbsp;local and national
markets.&nbsp; <br> <br>The government's food policy has been the
object of praise by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on
a number of occasions. Recently FAO country representative, Gero
Vaagt, confirmed that the Nicaraguan government's food security program
had been identified as one of the two most successful programs (along
with Sierra Leone's) of over 60 such programs monitored and supported
by the FAO around the globe.&nbsp; <br><br>The FSLN government's food
policy, which as well as the above mentioned measures involves free
school meals for all primary school children and support of community
and school run vegetable gardens, has significantly reduced the percentage of the
Nicaraguan population suffering from chronic malnutrition&nbsp;<a href="http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/general/53437">according to Vaagt</a>.
This&nbsp;is a stunning achievement at a time when the international
organization is registering record levels of malnutrition worldwide. (1)<br><br>The
international corporate media's suggestion that the worst of the crisis
is over, is regarded as inaccurate and over-optimistic by many respected economists.
Certainly, it would be wishful thinking to assume that from now on
things will become gradually easier for a vulnerable economy like
Nicaragua's. So far the government's crisis mitigation policies have
been commendable, though, and there is no apparent reason why this
should change in coming months. <br><br>Undoubtedly opposition forces
at home and abroad would have hoped that the impact of the economic
crisis would weaken popular support for the FSLN government. At this point, there is no reason to
suggest&nbsp;this is the case. With presidential elections just two
years away, the FSLN has maintained its position of favourite against
an unconvincing and divided opposition.&nbsp;</div>
      
    
  

<br>Note<br>1. Originally this report stated that malnutrition had
fallen from 50% to around 22% under the FSLN government. In fact, this
figure refers to the period 1990 to 2005. The mistake was discovered
when we checked the matter with the FAO's office in Managua. Mr.
Vaagt's remarks had been misreported by the local media.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
