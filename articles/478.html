<p><br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Beloved Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters; beloved Families; beloved Brothers and Sisters of this People's Army, of the Nicaraguan Army. I want to start this address by sharing the pain, the sadness of the families of two children, a girl and a boy, victims of the torrential downpours, who were swept away there in the Municipality of Diriamba.<br />
<br />
The girl Aura Nazar Flores Flores was 6 years old and attended the Third Level of Preschool. To her mother, Dayana del Carmen Flores Mojica, and her father, Jorge Luis Flores Portillo; the condolences of our People.<br />
<br />
The boy, 9-year-old Aaron Ezequiel Murillo Mojica, was in Second Grade. To his parents, Tania Mojica and Néstor Murillo Villavicencio, to them our condolences, our Solidarity, our Love, which is shared by all our People who were following via the media, on television, when adults, young people, many of the Sandinista Youth were mobilized, moving in the dark to look for the Children.<br />
<br />
A tragedy, like other tragedies that our people suffer, nor can we ignore the brutal crimes committed against Women. And as we have said, there is now the maximum penalty here, which is Life Imprisonment, life imprisonment for these criminals.<br />
<br />
And for the Families of those who have died in accidents of all kinds and especially in car accidents, our Solidarity, our Love; among them, Comrades, Brothers and Sisters of the Army, of the Police, who have died in accidents, in the line of Duty.<br />
<br />
Likewise, on behalf of our People, we have sent, and Compañera Rosario has already made known our Message, which is our Message of Solidarity with the Vice President of the Sister Republic of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, a brave, combative woman.<br />
<br />
But there are always the demons, the fascists, waging a brutal campaign that has been going on for some time now, of slander, false accusations, lynching by media, and of course, that media lynching has been deliberately stoked while the People back Cristina and look for ways to support her, but there was an attempt to assassinate her. The Solidarity of the People of Nicaragua to Cristina, her children, her family, to the Argentine People, and to President Alberto Fernández.<br />
<br />
And over the last few days too the World has reacted, in one way or another, to the death of the person who was the main leader of the Soviet Union, who promoted changes which in the end yielded results, although later betrayal gave those changes a different twist.<br />
<br />
We had the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union after the Revolution triumphed and this leader, President of the Soviet Union, was at the helm, and then other leaders followed him. We met with all of them and found Solidarity and Affection, from them and from the Soviet People.</span></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="200" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/336995.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p><br />
Mikhail Gorbachev died at the age of 91, and we had the opportunity to meet him in 1985, we were with Rosario there, conversing with him, exchanging with him. Unquestionably, this was not to the liking of the enemies of the Revolution and of the Nicaraguan people.<br />
<br />
Here I have the report from a European newspaper that said "Top Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, yesterday promised economic, diplomatic and political support for Nicaragua during the meeting held with the president of that country, Daniel Ortega, who was on a working visit in Moscow. Ortega, who went to the Soviet capital in search of economic support, obtained, in the opinion of Latin American media, the greatest public endorsement achieved so far by the Sandinista government from Moscow.”<br />
<br />
And Gorbachev declared: "The Soviet Union will continue to provide Nicaragua with fraternal help in solving the pressing tasks of economic development, and also political and diplomatic support in the defense of its sovereignty.”<br />
<br />
He gave support in all fields, at a time when the siege caused by the blockade promoted by President Ronald Reagan against Nicaragua was practically complete. There were times when they had even left us without oil.<br />
<br />
Then, I recall, talking to Comandante Fidel, he had the initiative to promote a collection among the countries of the Socialist Camp, and each one put up their quota of oil, and naturally Russia put its share of oil, and Cuba also put its share of oil, and that allowed us to keep going until the end of the war when we managed to defeat the imperialist aggression of the 1980s.<br />
<br />
"Gorbachev affirms that Solidarity with Nicaragua is an inalienable part of the struggle for peace.” You can see how he understood things, how he saw things, and, today, what are we doing? Striving for peace, we are still striving for peace.<br />
<br />
We cannot forget that gesture, that firmness of Gorbachev at a crucial moment for Nicaragua, when the pressure of the US government under President Reagan was fierce, for European countries to block Nicaragua, for European countries not to provide any cooperation to Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
And it was incredible, I remember that we made a tour of Europe and I remember the Meeting with the Prime Minister of England, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, may she rest in peace, she was very clear and she told us: We cannot establish better relations with you, unless you comply with what the United States commands. She said so quite clearly. The position of the Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl was the same, Kohl was Chancellor then, and the position was the same.<br />
<br />
That is, two powerful countries in Europe, among the most powerful, Germany and England, acting as servants, as slaves of the Yankee Empire to harm a humble, hardworking, striving People, but one with enormous Moral Wealth, with an enormous Wealth of Dignity.<br />
<br />
That is the Capital of the Nicaraguan people, Morality, Dignity, Loyalty to this Land where we are made of steel. This army we have today is made of steel, because of its firmness, not because we have atomic bombs, nor because we have very long-range rockets, but we do have Dignity, Strength, Courage and Loyalty to the nation, bigger, more powerful than any atomic bomb.<br />
<br />
And this steel that today is the Nicaraguan Army, has been forged since the time when Diriangén, Nicarao and other Caciques from different parts of our country resisted the colonizers. They did not give up, they did not sell out, and they preferred to give up their lives rather than bow to the conquerors. That is where the Spirit of our People comes from, the Moral Strength of our People and of our Army.<br />
<br />
Then came the moment of our country's Independence, but when that Independence was proclaimed, the main Religious Authority of Nicaragua opposed the Independence of Nicaragua, opposed the Independence of Central America. There it is in the history books of the time, where the records were collected.<br />
<br />
But Nicaragua and Central America did achieve Independence, because those were moments of struggle of the Peoples in Our America, where the Peoples of the South were liberated with Bolívar at the head and the Peoples of the North were liberated with the great Mexican fighters, Hidalgo and all the great Mexican fighters who fought their battles until they achieved Independence.<br />
<br />
Those two great Peoples, that is, two huge countries, one to the North, the other to the South; from Venezuela came Bolívar and from Mexico, from the Soul, from the Heart of Mexico came the Pride and Honor of a People who had been oppressed by the colonizers. And there too was independence for Central America.</p>

<p><br />
We had only been independent for a few years when we already had the slaveholders coming here, Yankee expansionists led by William Walker. And Walker, we all know the story, became President of Nicaragua and had the blessing of the American Government and also of High Officials of the Catholic Church here in our country, who praised him; they promoted him, and they were even appointed as representatives by Walker to the Government of the United States, there they were as representatives of Walker, representing Nicaragua to the Government of the United States.<br />
<br />
And at that moment the steel that had been forged in the struggle of our indigenous ancestors was taken up again by the Nicaraguan People, and there the Army defended Nicaragua's Dignity led by José Dolores Estrada, reminding us now of that phrase of José Dolores, “overcome or die”, giving the battle against the invaders in conditions of technical inferiority, because the weapons that the invaders brought were much more advanced than those that our brothers then had in those moments of struggle.<br />
<br />
And there appears the arm of Andrés, which is the arm of you all, beloved Brothers and Sisters, there appears the arm of Andrés, and we overcame, the Nicaraguan people in those years defeated the Yankee invader... They defeated him! A feat that is only realized by the courage of a People with Dignity, one that knows how to respond even in the most critical and most difficult moments.<br />
<br />
Then the Liberal Revolution came and formed institutions with a freedom-loving, Sovereign Spirit, but the Yankee Empire came and overthrew the head of the Liberal Revolution, General José Santos Zelaya. And then in that moment who raised the flag to face the Yankee troops combined with the local sell outs who advanced towards Masaya, towards Coyotepe, where the battle was being fought? Nicaraguans with dignity, led by General Benjamin Zeledon.<br />
<br />
And that Courage, that Strength, that Dignity of General Zeledón, surrounded, and with the Yankees telling him to surrender, that they were going to spare his Life, that they were not going to put him in prison, and he responded with Dignity, that October 4th 1912, giving his Life for the Nation. And just as the Blood and Spirit of Diriangén and Nicarao, of José Dolores Estrada, of Andrés Castro, the Blood and Spirit of General Zeledón continued to forge the steel.<br />
<br />
And who at that moment gathered in his Soul, in his Heart the Dignity to continue forging that steel? Our General Sandino, who was a boy, and saw when the Yankees were exhibiting Zeledón's corpse so as to sow terror, but in General Sandino they did not sow terror, they sowed Love of the Nation, Love of Freedom, Love of Sovereignty, and that led our General Sandino, later, to confront and defeat the Yankee troops.<br />
<br />
That is why also in that campaign that our General Sandino fought for several years, where one day like today, September 2, 1928, in New York, 3 new bomber planes and 3 other reconnaissance planes were embarked aboard a US Army ship bound for Nicaragua. Just imagine! The Yankees bringing with their troops also the bombers to use against the People of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
And the Army in Defense of National Sovereignty, on a day like today, in the year 1927, General Sandino signed the Constitutive Act of the Army Defending National Sovereignty. He was not intimidated in front of the Yankee forces that were superior by far, he did not cower in front of the Yankee Aviation that bombed Towns, Fields and Cities, on the contrary, the steel was being forged even more there, and the Yankees in Nicaragua were defeated.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="200" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/337026.jpeg" width="400" /></p>

<p><br />
And we already know the story, how they had to resort to betrayal, to treacherous dialogue, to Somoza's ”Judas embrace" in order to assassinate the General, believing that in this way Courage, Dignity was going to disappear from the Heart of the Nicaraguan People, and on the contrary, in the Heart of all of you is the Heart of General Sandino, tempering the steel and yet more steel, giving more strength to the steel.<br />
<br />
Then, in 1958, General Ramón Raudales, who came from the Army of our General Sandino, at the age of 60 swore to the fighters Heriberto Reyes, Julio Alonso Leclair, Manuel Baldizón, among others, that they would enter combat to give continuity to the struggle of the Army in Defense of National Sovereignty.<br />
<br />
It was exactly on September 2, 1958 that this Oath was given, and they entered combat, an unequal combat, but it was with Dignity, Strength, Courage, and General Raudales along with other compañeros fell in combat on October 18, 1958, that is, fighting really  from September to October; from taking the Oath they went into combat, and in combat they went on to give up their Lives. But they did not die, because they did not die, because what their Blood of Heroes and Martyrs did was strengthen the Soul of our People<br />
<br />
Later, Colonel Santos López meets with Carlos, with Tomás, with Jorge Navarro, with the leaders of the Front, and there the Army in Defense of National Sovereignty starts giving battle again, giving continuity to the Struggle for Peace, for Freedom, for Sovereignty, and the first guerrilla combats take place, a guerrilla force full of moral strength, with few resources, and where the compañeros, including Jorge Navarro, gave their lives there in Bocay, in the Patuca, in the first combats of the Front.<br />
<br />
After those combats and that guerrilla experience that took place in the border area with Honduras, then the Front, led by Carlos, decided that we will have to look for an area where there is more population, because, of course, those areas were more isolated, so to seek where there was more population, where there were more people, and therefore to incorporate them into the struggle under the banner of the Sandinista Front.<br />
<br />
Pablo Úbeda had been doing this investigative work in the area of Matagalpa and Jinotega, and there the decision was made to install a base camp as quietly as possible, and then, once the conditions were created, to start fighting. And that was Pancasan, in August.<br />
<br />
But that process began months earlier, in August came the clash. But this work little by little began much earlier, talking with the peasants, incorporating peasants into the Guerrilla, training them there in the camp, developing communication networks, making drop sites so as to have food reserves there and especially honey, because honey can be buried for years and is not damaged, and also ammunition reserves of what was being obtained. It was a small detachment really, this detachment like that of our General Sandino would set out with just 30.<br />
<br />
Then as that process developed,  malaria began to afflict the guerrillas. I remember there in the camp many compañeros were in their hammocks, and from where could we get a Doctor? We did not hesitate to talk to Dr. Oscar Danilo Rosales, a recent graduate of the University of León and who was already teaching, he was very advanced in his profession, and when we talked to him, he did not hesitate to say "I'm going to Pancasán". He joined the groups in Pancasán and made it possible to recover the health of all the compañeros who were very affected by malaria.<br />
<br />
That was when Francisco Moreno whom we called “Chele Moreno”, because his name was Francisco and his surname Moreno, but he was <span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><i>chele</i></span><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">, with blue eyes, so then we called him “the Chele Moreno”, he was a youth, and when we came in a group here joining the Front, I was a little older than him, doing Literacy work here in Managua's Acahualinca barrio, in Los Pescadores barrio, with the student movement, with the FER, and from time to time we were captured, we were so young that in the end they released us after having us detained for a few days or months.<br />
<br />
Well, when the Front was already setting up the detachment in Pancasan, he insisted that he was going to the Guerrilla; but the older Compañeros questioned that a boy of around 15, 16 years old, should join the Guerrilla, he was in high school, but he insisted and joined the Guerrilla. And there the steel continued to be forged.<br />
<br />
Francisco Moreno “El Chele", his father was a Doctor, Dr. José Moreno, and his mother, also Dr. Estela de Moreno.<br />
<br />
And then there are some Notes from Carlos that say a lot about how steel is being forged, the steel that has been forged since the first resistance against the conquerors.<br />
<br />
Being in the encampment, I remember, we were in the encampment with Carlos, Oscar Turcios, a number of compañeros there, meanwhile a Column headed by Silvio Mayorga had left heading for Cerro Musún. We were in the area of the Dariense Mountain Range and further inland was the Musún Hill and as the strategy defined it allowed us better conditions to build drop points and expand the area, foreseeing that at any time the Somoza Army could appear and maintaining a lot of vigilance, a lot of patrolling.<br />
<br />
So then, the column headed by Silvio set off but they managed to detect it, and the Somoza Guard who already had information that something was being planned there, and had spent several months there, began to move against the column headed by Silvio, and they were ambushed. So just as the column was advancing, it fell into the ambush that the Guard had set. And there fighting took place, there no one gave up, there the steel was forged once again. No one gave up there!<br />
<br />
And Francisco Moreno, because he had the habit of teaching literacy that we had practiced here in Managua, the first thing he did when he saw that there were illiterate peasants in the camp, was to call them, sit them down and begin teaching them to read and write. That was when Carlos passed by, and he said: "Yes, teach them to read as well” that phrase was the result of the initiative of our brother Francisco Moreno.<br />
<br />
Carlos sent a letter to Francisco's parents, because we already know what happened, that is, we had to vacate the central camp where Carlos, Oscar Turcios, all the compañeros were, and they spread among safe houses here in Managua and in other points. Carlos then, in the month of March of the year 1968, because this incident of Pancasán, and the incidents of the ambushes, were at the end of the month of August of 1967, he wrote to the parents of Francisco Moreno:<br />
<br />
"I want to address a few lines to you that will perhaps bring a little encouragement to your hearts that are anguished with sorrow. The martyrdom of Francis and of the other compañeros and of all the exploited peasants has not happened in vain." Because there the Guard razed homes and killed peasants just because they were suspected of cooperating with the guerrillas. "They were the price that was paid for justice to flourish."<br />
<br />
Then Carlos says: "Our hands shook the hands of the impoverished Peasants, squeezed by the landowners. We watched children agonize and starve to death. We were by the side of the man in poverty who not only has never been to a school, but has never seen a school with his own eyes.” Because there were no schools in all those areas.<br />
<br />
"Francis had the purity of a saint's soul. The primitive Christians, pure in spirit and devoted to Good, would have considered him as one of their own."<br />
<br />
And why have fighters with the courage of Francis been defeated by the mercenaries of the GN? The answer is that the first steps are being taken in Nicaragua, in the march towards Liberation. And in the early days the movement is fragile and tender, one writer has compared it to the stunted peasant child." He is born stunted and then, when he survives, he achieves great strength later.<br />
<br />
And Carlos says: "Because of the impostors we have been forced to give birth to the real rebellion.<br />
<br />
The future is ours, the future belongs to the Nation, to Justice. The blood that Francisco Moreno gave, has to be rewarded.<br />
<br />
The combatant brother Francisco Moreno was a model of generosity and heroism. He lived in a hard working household where he personally needed nothing. He renounced these comforts and threw himself into a life of danger...”.<br />
<br />
And he says“ "I remember Francisco in the first days I was on the mountain. In those days the long days hurt his feet and sores opened up. But he did not complain. He overcame, mastered the mud and after the first few days his legs hardened and became the legs of a walker.<br />
<br />
The Apostle José Martí says: The blood of the good is not shed in vain.<br />
<br />
The Life that remains to me does not belong to myself, it belongs to the Brothers and Sisterr who have fallen, to the Ideal that we have embraced.”<br />
<br />
As I noted earlier, with Francisco there also fell Silvio Mayorga and other compañeros. These were the soldiers who were forging and who continued to forge the steel. There they fell heroically, they were leaders of the Front, Founders of the Front such as Silvio Mayorga, Rigoberto Cruz, Pablo Úbeda, founder of the Front; Carlos Tinoco, Otto Casco, Carlos Reyna; ”The Tiger of Cerro Colorado" as Nicolás Sánchez was called; Ernesto Fernández, Oscar Danilo Rosales. And there survived Gladys Baez, Edmundo Perez who was there and managed to survive; we thought he had died, and suddenly he appeared here in a clandestine house.<br />
<br />
Eulalio also survived, a peasant who was extremely familiar with the ways and paths and was an extraordinary guide, such that the guerrilla fighters could move in the dark, moved from one point to another in the dark, at night; during the day you could not travel because it was exposing yourself to be discovered.</span></p>

<br />
Our recognition, our greeting, our applause to the Ambassadors who accompany us.<br />
<br />
I was telling you, that you represent the moment of greatest consolidation, of greatest Strength of the Army of Nicaragua, that is why I was telling you that steel was tempered here, we can say that with all the firmness with which General Avilés explained it: An Army for Sovereignty, for Peace, for Security; an Army with the Strength of our Heroes and our Martyrs, and that of the Heroes who continued with us along that route that we were making to Pancasán, because later the October offensive would come and the People's Army growing there.<br />
<br />
The soldiers of the Sandinista Front were multiplying in all the Municipalities, in all the Departments they are already encircling the Barracks of the Guard imposed by the Yankees.<br />
<br />
It was moving then on to a new stage of struggle, of war that leads to taking positions, to taking barracks, to waging a high-intensity battle there on the Southern Front, where when his military barracks were falling in this area Somoza tried to blockade the Southern Front, destroy it and then return with that troop, the EBBI, which was the most specialized force he had, to look for how to recover the military barracks that were in the hands of the soldiers of the Sandinista Front.<br />
<br />
And there, in combats where there was aerial bombing by then, and also thanks to the Solidarity of Comandante Fidel and the Solidarity and participation of Latin American Brothers and Sisters, we strengthened the Southern Front and we did not let the specialized troops of the Yankees here in Nicaragua overcome us, and those troops were defeated.<br />
<br />
And on July 19th, when we entered this Square, it was Nicaragua's Dignity entering here, all our Heroes and Martyrs were entering, all that power, all that strength that allowed us to grow, to grow even in the greatest difficulties, even through what seemed defeats, the People returned to the struggle, until Victory was finally achieved and with Victory the People's Army was born, the Sandinista Army was born, today the Army of Nicaragua, for Peace, for Security, for Justice.<br />
<br />
And how important is the work you do, beloved Brothers and Sisters. I won't repeat everything that General Avilés, Commander-in-Chief, has already reported, but I do want to highlight the work you do visiting Communities, hamlets, villages, even in the most distant places. There we have seen the Territorial Commanders, there we have seen the National Commanders, there we have seen General Avilés, with Peasants, with Workers, sharing, to strengthen that Unity that says, "People, Army, Unity, Guarantee of peace", Guarantee of Victory so that we have Peace, so that we have Security.<br />
<br />
We congratulate the Compañeras and Compañeros who have been promoted, the Generals, the Colonels, all the Compañeras and Compañeros promoted  in other ranks, because the promotions are multiple, and to them, to their Families, we can say with great pride, that Nicaragua throughout History has managed to forge the Steel of Dignity, the Steel of Love, the Steel of Firmness, in the Army of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
Long live the 43rd Anniversary<br />
of the Army of Nicaragua!<br />
Our Nation and Freedom!<br />
Our Nation and Peace!<br />
And Long live Nicaragua, Blessed and Forever Free!</p>

<h3><b>Remarks by Rosario, Vice-President of Nicaragua, after the Event<br />
to Commemorate the 43rd Anniversary of the Army of Nicaragua</b></h3>

<h3 class="western" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>September 2nd 2022</b></h3>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
A very good evening, beloved Families of this Blessed nation, of this Dignified, Sovereign, Forever Free, Always Striving and Victorious nation!<br />
<br />
How can we not say today, on the 43rd Anniversary of our Glorious Nicaraguan Army, that it has been strengthened day by day, in the Spirit, in the Greatness of our National Heroes, of our Heroes and Martyrs, in the daily learning of what that Greatness represents, in the daily assessment and in the daily assimilation, so as to represent that Greatness in terms of being Steadfast, Courageous, Cohesive, Consequential.<br />
<br />
How proud we are to have that Nicaraguan Soul, that People's Soul, this Army that is Our People in Uniform, and to be able to say in all Certainty, with every Confidence: People, Army, Unity, Guarantee of All Victories!<br />
<br />
The main victory is Peace...! The Peace that we have been achieving, that we have been sustaining and defending, because it is our Heroic Heritage. The Peace that represents the Life of so many, the Blood of so many, that has been offered so that we might live, as we should live, with Justice, Tranquility, Security, envisaging and creating that Future that belongs to all of us.<br />
<br />
This Heroic People of Nicaragua deserve an Army like this one, precisely because the Army is the People in Uniform. Because the Compañeros and Compañeras who make up our Army come from Humble Families, who throughout the Country are representing their relatives, brothers, children, relatives, who through this Army whose Gigantic Soul, Nicaraguan by the Grace of God, we sense there defending us with Heroism, with Patriotism, Love. That Love for Nicaragua that we all have, that Love between us, that Christian, Fraternal, Solidarity based Love, a Love that has led us through all the stages of our History with a Combative Spirit.<br />
<br />
That is to say, we know that each stages of our Glorious History has shown the best of ourselves, has revealed, made more and more visible what we are: A People where the Love that is Steel has been tempered, the Love that is Courage, that is Nobility, that is Magnanimous, that is National Dignity. The Love that is Sovereignty!<br />
<br />
We feel proud... I want to send an embrace to the Families of all the Compañeros and Compañeras who make up our Army. And congratulations to all of us Nicaraguans, because we have this Excellent Detachment, of Women and Men, where each of us feels represented in the absolute willingness to continue defending Peace and the Nation... the Nation and Peace. We say: There is a Nation, and There is Peace!<br />
<br />
Defending what belongs to us: This Land that is ours and not merely of those who have more, we said in revolutionary songs that we learned to sing. And when we mention "those who have most” we also mean those who from the outside have tried to dominate us and have been defeated by the Strength of our People at every moment, and by the Strength of our Institutions, all are sons and daughters of the Revolution. The Revolution of Love, Justice, Equity, and the Dreams of all Nicaraguans being realized.<br />
<br />
Embraces, Compañeros and Compañeras. And once again, congratulations all in the Homes of our Soldiers, Brave Soldiers, and to each of us, as Nicaraguans, knowing that we have confidence, that we have certainty, that we live safely, that we live in calm and quiet, that there is no repetition here of the attack on Peace and Goodness.<br />
<br />
Because that is what we have defended all our lives... Peace and Right, Peace and Goodness, and that is what we are going to continue defending with everything we are: that characteristic that is inherited, the Legacy of those Great Nicaraguans who honor us, as we deserve, because that Greatness is deserved by all of us, we inherit it, we have it, and with that Greatness of Soul, with that deep Spirit, with that Great Spirituality and with the Light that the Creator imparts to us every day.<br />
<br />
Because I always say, everything that has happened in Nicaragua and the way in which we Nicaraguans, dignified, brave and loving, have faced every circumstance, is only possible with the Hand of God, and from the Hand of God, with Spiritual, Providential Strength. This is what we feel, this is what we live out, and this is what we give thanks for every day. In this Nicaragua of ours, of Striving, of Hard Work, of Learning, of Study, of Victories, the God of All Victories lives, enlightening and inspiring us!<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, Compañeras and Compañeros. Tomorrow we will be watching the Army in the Military Parade the Children and our Families also enjoy so much, namely seeing all the equipment our Soldiers know how to use skillfully, with Soul, with Love, to defend Security and Peace.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Compañeros and Compañeras. Thank you.</p>
