            <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">David McKnight,
              September 8th 2011</span><br>
            <br>
            David McKnight : What work has CEDEHCA been doing on the
            Coast and what changes have happened on the Coast in the
            past five years?<br>
            <br>
            Michael Campbell: CEDEHCA is the Centre for Human, Civil and
            Autonomous Rights, we are a community development NGO that
            focuses on education, human and autonomy rights. We only
            work on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua and in the
            framework of the autonomy process. <br>
            <br>
            I believe that in the last five years, the situation,
            economic and political, social and cultural situation of
            indigenous people and people of African descent has improved
            a lot, in part because this government understands the
            importance of the autonomy process, and has visualised the
            autonomy process as a development strategy for the Caribbean
            Coast of Nicaragua. <br>
            <br>
            And therefore has been able to come up with a human
            development plan for the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua which
            takes into account things like land demarcation, the
            importance of the education system, the justice
            administration system,&nbsp; and the health system of the
            indigenous people and the people of African descent. That's
            in part.<br>
            <br>
            Also because civil society organisations such as CEDEHCA,
            FADCANIC, URACCAN and BICU, have developed the necessary
            skills to strengthen the communities, so while five years
            ago you would have a communal government, already elected,
            but without a clear understanding of what their priorities,
            their problems, and their needs are, now because of the work
            that our organisations have been doing these people are
            clear &#8211; they know exactly what they want and that's why when
            the government was doing the consultation process for the
            human development plan for the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua,
            everything was already in place. <br>
            <br>
            This has allowed the government to make some of its social
            programmes come towards the region in a way that communities
            can really take advantage of them. For example &#8211; artisanal
            fishery, credit for artisanal fishery and also the technical
            assistance that they need to carry that out has improved
            vastly especially in the case of Rama Cay, El Bluff is more
            commerce but also they have become involved in that, the
            Pearl Lagoon Basin, Karawala, Sandy Bay here in the south
            and also to a certain extent in Puerto Cabezas and a little
            bit above there, close to the coast with Honduras. <br>
            <br>
            The government has also improved with its Hunger Zero
            programme here so agricultural producers here on the
            Caribbean Coast have benefited a lot. Before, those
            programmes were only limited to the mestizo population but
            now the Miskitu population, the Mayagnas, and even the
            Afro-descendant &#8211; the creoles and the Garifunas &#8211; have begun
            to develop the agricultural production in their own
            communities and this is very important because now the way
            that these programmes are starting is that agricultural
            production is limited not only to subsistence, it's also
            that they are producing enough to export to the nearby
            semi-urban areas. <br>
            <br>
            And also some communities are even learning how to export
            out of Nicaragua, towards the Caribbean, and in the
            framework of CAFTA or also exporting to Venezuela and the
            other ALBA countries. This is something that's important
            because the basis for generating income based on your own
            culture, your own tradition and your best practices is
            generating a boom here in the region and you can see that
            development has become plausible to a certain extent. <br>
            <br>
            DM :The international English language media focuses on what
            they call the 'white lobster' or cocaine and portray the
            coast as a place where there's&nbsp; only drugs. What is
            CEDEHCA's experience?<br>
            <br>
            MC : First of all, one of the most important things that we
            have to take into account when we want to put in place a
            strategy for combating drug trafficking and organised crimes
            is that we have to fight the myths that exist. Nicaragua and
            Central America, the Caribbean Coast of central america are
            actually victims in the drug trade, we have to make this
            clear. <br>
            <br>
            The drugs are produced in the South and they are sold in the
            market in the north. We are just the channel through where
            the drugs pass through. Therefore you cannot identify these
            communities necessarily as problems in the drug trafficking
            or people that are really benefiting from the drug
            trafficking. It's important to understand that these
            communities have been historically marginalised, you have
            had very little presence of the state, there is very few
            opportunities for income generation. Education, culture and
            recreation is also very small here. <br>
            <br>
            If there is any type of development presence there in these
            communities it is only through the presence of the work that
            CEDEHCA and other civil society organisations do there.
            Maybe another serious problem is that all the effort that
            the government of Nicaragua and that other governments have
            done is to increase the spending, increase the budget for
            coercion &#8211; you give more funding to the police, you give
            more funding to the navy or to the army in general. These
            communities have never had good relations or there has never
            been a presence of these institutions in these communities
            so you cannot expect these communities to cooperate with a
            coercive institutions, institutions of order so quickly. <br>
            <br>
            Nicaragua's best strategy to help in combating drugs and
            organised crime is to develop these communities, these
            marginalised coastal communities. So in the case of CEDEHCA
            we think that the strategy has to be aimed at eliminating
            vulnerabilities with regard to drug trafficking and
            organised crime. This means that first, any strategy has to
            focus on the traditional, political and social order within
            the community. You have to strengthen the communal
            governance first, increase their capacity to plan, help them
            get the necessary resources in place to help them get their
            development plans going &#8211; these kinds of things. <br>
            <br>
            That has to be Step One. Increased governance within these
            communities. Now with Law 445, with the Autonomy Law, these
            communities have actually began to use electoral processes.
            It's not only the elders in the communities that
            participate, now you have women participating and young
            people, and now the elections are carried out periodically.
            So that's one &#8211; you have to increase the communal
            government's capacity to function. <br>
            <br>
            Second, in the drug trafficking process, young people, young
            adults, are the ones to a certain extent help the drug
            traffickers passing by because this is their only means of
            surviving so they know that by helping these drug
            traffickers, providing them with safe haven at some point
            and also maybe with fuel, they gain a lot of income and this
            income in turn is used within the community so that's why
            some of these communities have parks and maybe good houses
            and things like that, the basics. <br>
            <br>
            And the other ones are the women. Women don't necessary
            participate in drug trafficking, international drug
            trafficking but they are the ones who set up the in-house
            drug trafficking, the places where they sell drugs. The
            second point of the strategy has to be to get women and
            young people involved in any activity that will help them
            generate income. <br>
            <br>
            Because they are getting involved in this not because there
            is a culture of the 'white lobster' or a culture of drugs
            here on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. They are doing it
            because they make a conscious decision to survive. They are
            not worried about who is consuming it in the United States
            or in Mexico or who is producing it in the south. All they
            know is that they need to generate income and that they need
            to survive and to provide for their families. <br>
            <br>
            The third thing, and I think this is starting to become a
            more pressing issue. It's that, because of the drug
            trafficking and even drug consumption, the values within the
            communities are beginning to deteriorate. So a strong and
            conscious effort has to be put in place to target cultural
            identity, strengthening cultural identity and strengthening
            the moral fabric within the communities. <br>
            <br>
            The elders don't participate in the drug trafficking, it's
            always the young and women. They are the ones that have the
            traditional values and the traditional cultures that
            shouldn't be lost. These are the source of identity for
            these communities and it's very important to keep those
            things when they are coming to plan for the future. So
            strengthening generational links, promoting culture and
            recreation for young people is the third thing that you have
            to take into account.<br>
            <br>
            But it's a question of eliminating vulnerabilities. It's not
            a question of trying to combat drugs directly. These
            communities would not be engaged in drug trafficking if they
            were not poor, marginalised communities. <br>
            <br>
            DM : CEDEHCA will be doing some work in relation the
            presidential elections &#8211; observation, monitoring, can you
            tell me a little bit about this work?<br>
            <br>
            MC : CEDEHCA has been doing electoral observation on the
            Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua since 1996. We carry out
            electoral observation with over four hundred observers.
            Usually we cover about 60% of all the voting stations in the
            region. CEDEHCA's priority in the election is to try to
            guarantee,&nbsp; first of all the education of the community
            about the importance of voting &#8211; you have to go out and
            vote. <br>
            <br>
            And the second one is that the necessary lobbying about the
            priorities of the indigenous people, people of African
            descent and mestizos on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua are
            incorporated within the political campaigns of all the
            different political parties. This is how we have managed to
            get the autonomy process running. With regards to this
            election &#8211; as you know, things are a little bit complicated
            &#8211; but CEDEHCA will stick to the strategy that it's always
            done. We limit ourselves to just comment and criticise the
            technical aspects of the election. <br>
            <br>
            We believe that the electoral observation requires you to be
            completely and totally impartial. And these communities
            trust CEDEHCA because of the work we've done because of the
            confidence we've generated because of the legitimacy with
            which we work. So we don't comment on the political agendas,
            or even the ideologies of any of the political parties. We
            leave that decision to the people. <br>
            <br>
            What we try to measure more than anything is the tendency of
            the votes of indigenous and Afro-descendant people. We try
            to measure the tendency of how women and young people vote.
            And the technical aspects have to do with 'are the voting
            stations in place to guarantee as much access for the people
            as possible, are the people treated well, is the electoral
            list complete. We try to measure the level of abstentionism.
            Basically these kind of things. <br>
            <br>
            Our reports our presented, after the Supreme Electoral
            Council presents their report, we present it to them and
            then they have a moment to criticise it and after that we
            present it to the media and make it and make it available to
            the country and every else who needs it. In the case of the
            Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, electoral observation is
            fundamental. <br>
            <br>
            We have more elections here in this region than in any other
            part of the country. We have communal elections, we have
            municipal elections then we have elections for the Regional
            Council, then we have national elections in which you elect
            the two representatives of the region &#8211; well, there are
            five, 3 in the north and 2 in the south. We elect all the
            national congressmen and we elect our congressmen to the
            Central American Parliament. So it means that the indigenous
            and Afro-descendant people of the region have to require
            organisations such as CEDEHCA to provide education about how
            the elections are going to be conducted, and they also trust
            us to make sure that elections are conducted in a
            transparent and impartial way. <br>
