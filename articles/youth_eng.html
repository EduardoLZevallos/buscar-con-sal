gangs in Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">by Karla Jacobs, June
3rd 2011</span><br>
      <br>
According to recent National Police stastistics approximately 3,000
children, adolescents and young adults belong to gangs in Nicaragua.
The police classify these groups in two categories: a) Groups of Young
People at Risk and b) Youth Gangs or Pandillas, the former being less
well organized and less likely to be involved in criminal activity than
the latter. <br>
      <br>
Despite the relatively small number of gang members at a national
level, it would not be unfair to suggest that the phenomenon of the
&#8220;pandillas&#8221; or groups of young people involved in violent and criminal
acts actually impacts the lives of a significant proportion of
Nicaraguan society in one way or another, especially the lives of
residents in marginalized city neighboorhoods &#8220;barrios.&#8221;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In fact it is possible to argue that issues surrounding the presence of
&#8220;pandillas&#8221; in the country have actually become one of the main sources
of discordance within Nicaraguan society given the tendency among
citizens to blame their perception of high levels of insecurity in
towns and cities acorss the country on &#8220;pandillas,&#8221; something which, in
many areas, has lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes
towards young people in general. <br>
      <br>
The spiralling levels of extreme violence which other Central American
nations have suffered as a result of the inadequate management of gangs
is widely documented. Nicaragua, on the other hand, despite presenting
similar adverse social and economic conditions to Guatemala, Honduras
and El Salvador, has been able to contain the levels of crime and
violence associated with the &#8220;pandillas&#8221; and, happily, maintains its
status as the safest country in Central America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
To a large extent this can be put down to the success of the National
Police's approach to the groups of young people involved to a greater
or lesser extent in criminal and violent activity. In 2003 the National
Police set up a special department within the instiution called the
Department of Youth Affairs (DAJUV) to coordinate the transformation of
police management of youth gangs based on preventive measures. The work
of DAJUV has been widely praised and acknowledged by different
international organizations and agencies as a model to be imitated in
the rest of the region.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
One of the most successful experiences registered by DAJUV in terms of
preventing gang crime and violence has been the experience reported in
the northern city of Matagalpa where a strong alliance has been forged
between DAJUV and a grassroots youth movement called &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n
Sana&#8221; (Wholesome Recreation) which works with hundreds of at risk young
people in marginalized areas of the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
While in 2000 there were around 19 youth gangs with roughly 500 active
members who were regularly involved in violent crime in the city of
Matagalpa, today according to the local police authorities, there are
no gangs in the province. <br>
      <br>
Captain Liduvina Morales, founder of DAJUV in the department of
Matagalpa, and Jairo Rivas Blanchard, a former gang leader and founder
of &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana,&#8221; spoke to www.tortillaconsal.com about
their work in Matagalpa, which serves as an example, not just for
Nicaragua, but for the whole of Latin America. <br>
      <br>
The Integrated Approach of the Department of Youth Affairs <br>
      <br>
Testimony by Captain Liduvina Morales:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The work of the Department of Youth Affairs is based on the philosophy
that preventive measures including the provision of training, support
and counselling for young people involved in gangs is more effective
that the implementation of repressive measures.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
It is important to emphasize that the vast majority of gang members are
themselves victims of violence in the home. They provoke violence in
the streets, but they also receive violence at home. In other words
violence has become part of their identity. It feels natural to them to
use and propagate violence as a defense mechanism. They form gangs in
order to feel stronger, more powerful, and to protect themselves from
the adversities of our society.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Another factor which plays an important role in the tendency for young
people to form or join gangs is the economic migration of their
parents. Very often you will find that gang members were not brought up
by their own parents but by their grandparents, an aunt or uncle, or
even by a neighbour. And even if a grandmother, or an aunt, or a
neighbour tries hard to do their best bringing up someone else's
children, rarely are they able to provide all the care and attention
the children need. <br>
      <br>
Taking into account these social factors, DAJUV has developed a working
plan in which we meet with gang members out in the &#8220;barrios&#8221; and talk
to them about their lives. In coordination with other State
institutions and with a number of NGOs we provide access to counseling,
we support them so they can continue their education and, when
appropriate, we facilitate technical training in things like automotive
mechanics, electrics and computing. <br>
      <br>
According to our records 100% of the 450 gang members we registered in
2005 have been attended in this way. <br>
      <br>
As a result of this work today we very rarely register criminal
incidents provoked by what could be described as youth gangs in the
province of Matagalpa. It is true that there are a number of
adolescents and young people involved in petty crime and theft, but
these are young people acting on their own account, not as part of a
gang. The majority are glue sniffers and street children who live
chaotic lives. Unfortunately in Matagalpa there is no appropriate
rehabilitation center for these kids.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The National Police in Matagalpa consider Jairo Blanchard (founder and
coordinator of &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana&#8221;) an exemplary young man. In
years past he was the leader of what was probably the most violent gang
here in Matagalpa. But today, and for many years now, he has worked
tirelessly, and without any form of payment or formal support, to
provide at risk young people in the province with an alternative
formation based on non violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The &#8220;pandillas&#8221; : young people in rebellion against a system that
excludes them<br>
      <br>
Testimony by Jairo Rivas Blanchard, &#8220;El Pandi&#8221; <br>
      <br>
I was born into a very, very poor family. We never had a house. A lot
of the time we had no food. I was born during times of war and I was
brought up during times of war. I grew up without my dad who died
around the time of the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution. My mum has
always suffered from bad health which has made it impossible for her to
work. <br>
      <br>
So, when I was little, I had to go out onto the street looking for the
means by which to survive, the means by which to continue existing. But
what I found on the streets were drugs, violence, alcoholism, crime and
other things that young people involved with the &#8220;pandillas&#8221; get caught
up in. <br>
      <br>
There are lots of ways to become involved in a gangs. Mine was my state
of extreme poverty and absolute social risk. <br>
      <br>
The situation of the young people involved in what society refers to
and condemns as the &#8220;pandillas&#8221; is very complicated and diffifult to
understand. It is also a situation which has proved difficult to
resolve because, a lot of the time, the people with the funding to
resolve it don't understand the reality of these kids, they haven't
been through what the kids themselves have been through.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Belonging to a gang is a form of rebellion against a conservative
society and a capitalist system that excludes us and limits us in many
different ways. <br>
      <br>
When you belong to a gang you have the right to participate &#8211; something
which is denied to you in other forums. This gives you a sense of
control over your own life. When you are a gang member you are the one
who decides what you are going to eat, what you are going to do, what
you are going to steal. You decide who you are going to beat up. It's a
way of venting negative emotions. <br>
      <br>
On top of this you benefit from the tradition of solidarity between
gang members &#8211; you share the food you have, you share all the things
you get hold of, you look out for each other and you protect each
other. <br>
      <br>
But in truth, this form of rebellion doesn't really help you in any
way. What it ends up doing is destroying you emotionally, physically
and financially. <br>
      <br>
Searching for an alternative to so much violence<br>
      <br>
For six years I was involved in &#8220;maras&#8221; (extremely violent criminal
gangs) in El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico, during which time I didn't
visit Nicaragua or see my family. During those six years, when I was
involved in all sorts of serious crimes, I was in a state of emotional
break down. <br>
      <br>
And when I returned to Matagalpa in 2000 I was in a wreck, I felt very
near the edge. I didn't know what on earth to do with my life. I was
searching for some sort of solution or alternative to so much violence.
It was under those circumstances that I founded the Youth Movement
&#8220;Recreation Sana.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
In 2000 there were 19 violent gangs (&#8220;pandillas&#8221;) in the city of
Matagalpa. These gangs had no qualms about attacking each other or
members of the public at any time of day or night. They had no qualms
about wounding people or damaging private property. Ordinary people had
to pay them a sort of unofficial tax to enter certain neighbourhoods
and if someone refused pay then they would get beaten up.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The police had no control over the situation. They were unable to
control it with repressive measures like the imprisonment of gang
members. Actually police repression was making the situation worse &#8211;
the gangs reacted with greater violence, and more young people decided
to join the gangs dueing this time because they saw it as a necessary
step towards self protection from the police and from other gangs. <br>
      <br>
When I returned to Nicaragua the gangs knew about the sort of life I
had been living and so they respected me. It was because of this that I
was readily able to involve myself so intimately with the gang leaders.
They thought my plan was to increase the level of violence in the city,
so they accepted me &#8211; they wanted greater security. But really I had
other plans.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So, you see, it was from inside the gang structure and without the
support of any institution or organization that the Youth Movement
&#8220;Recreation Sana&#8221; was founded. At first, when we had zero funds, we
would improvise different activities &#8211; we would organize outings on
foot to other parts of the department, or we would get hold of a ball
and play football in some field or on the street.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
We were able to get members from six or seven different gangs together
at those sort of activities. It was proof that we could all get
together without violence. Sometimes we would take over the Central
Park or some other space and we would do dance contests or singing
contests. <br>
      <br>
It was during these sorts of activities and we were able to develop
different strategies and methods with which to urge the kids the change
their outlook, to refrain from their violent behaviour so that society
would stop condemning us and so that we wouldn't have to suffer
permanent police persecution. <br>
      <br>
That was how &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana&#8221; started. Later on we were able to
develop what today are our fully fledged sports leagues and cultural
groups in the &#8220;barrios.&#8221; All this has helped enormously in reducing
gang violence in the city. <br>
      <br>
It has been more of a challenge to reduce drug and alcohol consumption
among the kids we work with. From the very start, though, the level of
violence was drastically reduced. <br>
      <br>
&#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana&#8221; is not an institution. It is not an NGO. It is
not a Christian or political organization. It is simply a forum which
we ourselves have created so we can have permament participation. <br>
      <br>
If you look at our calender of activities you will see that there is
not a single day of the year when &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana&#8221; is not
involved in some activity or other. At present we have 84 groups of
children, adolescents and young adults in 60 different &#8220;barrios&#8221; in
Matagalpa for a total of over 780 kids directly involved in our
cultural and sporting actitivies, and around 1,700 who take part in
our&nbsp; events without actually being formal members of the groups. <br>
      <br>
At first the National Police didn't support &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana.&#8221;
They didn't understand that we genuinely wanted to reform our violent
behaviour. It was with the foundation of the Department of Youth
Affairs in 2004 that we started to build a different relationship with
the police. <br>
      <br>
Today we have very good relations with the police. The police trust us,
they believe in what we do and we are able to coordinate activities
together. I think the work carried out by DAJUV is excellent. And in
practical terms the existence of DAJUV has facilitated many different
aspects of the work we do at &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
Additionally over the last few years &#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana&#8221; has
recieved the support of different organizations which have facilitated
training workshops on different issues like leadership skills, conflict
resolution, non violent communication, self esteem, citizen
participation, sexual and reproductive health and the prevention of
HIV. All this has helped a lot because it has provided us with more
tools to reach out to at risk young people and help them not to damage
themselves or damage others. <br>
      <br>
There is no need to kill us or lock us up<br>
      <br>
Our work is hard. It requires a lot of effort and sacrifice. But it is
clear for all to see that our work has had an important impact. What we
aim to demonstrate with our work is that there is no need to kill us or
lock us up because we can change, and we can bring about change in
others. <br>
      <br>
I talk in these terms in reference to the barbaric policies implemented
in other parts of Central America which are refered to as the &#8220;mano
dura&#8221; and the &#8220;mano super dura&#8221; as part of which they apply the death
penalty to gang members &#8211; as if they think that is the key to bringing
about change and resolving different problems associated with the
gangs. What these policies actually do is lengthen and expand the chain
of violence thus provoking further grief and pain for society as a
whole. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&#8220;Recreaci&oacute;n Sana&#8221; is proof that we can change. Today Matagalpa's
&#8220;barrios&#8221; are tranquil and safe places. Today the city's at risk youth
can go to school and, like the rest of the population, can mobilize
freely without fear of bumping into rival gang members. According to
Matagalpa Police statistics, for the last three years there have been
no organized gangs involved in violent and criminal activity in the
department.&nbsp; <br>
