<div class="entry-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the fateful day of January 22, <a href="https://twitter.com/venanalysis/status/1087447663153500166">fewer than one in five</a> Venezuelans had heard of Juan Guaidó. Only a few months ago, the 35-year-old was an obscure character in a politically marginal far-right group closely associated with gruesome acts of street violence. Even in his own party, Guaidó had been a mid-level figure in the opposition-dominated National Assembly, which is now held under contempt according to Venezuela’s constitution. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after a single phone call from from US Vice President Mike Pence, Guaidó proclaimed himself as president of Venezuela. Anointed as the leader of his country by Washington, a previously unknown political bottom dweller was vaulted onto the international stage as the US-selected leader of the nation with the world’s largest oil reserves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echoing the Washington consensus, the New York Times editorial board </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/opinion/venezuela-guaido-maduro.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hailed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Guaidó as a “credible rival” to Maduro with a “refreshing style and vision of taking the country forward.” The Bloomberg News editorial board </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-25/guaido-s-bold-stroke-for-democracy-in-venezuela"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applauded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> him for seeking “restoration of democracy” and the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/revolt-in-venezuela-11548289111">declared</a> him</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a new democratic leader.” Meanwhile, Canada, numerous European nations, Israel, and the bloc of right-wing Latin American governments known as the Lima Group recognized Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Guaidó seemed to have materialized out of nowhere, he was, in fact, the product of more than a decade of assiduous grooming by the US government’s elite regime change factories. Alongside a cadre of right-wing student activists, Guaidó was cultivated to undermine Venezuela’s socialist-oriented government, destabilize the country, and one day seize power. Though he has been a minor figure in Venezuelan politics, he had spent years quietly demonstrated his worthiness in Washington’s halls of power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Juan Guaidó is a character that has been created for this circumstance,” Marco Teruggi, an Argentinian sociologist and leading chronicler of Venezuelan politics, told the Grayzone. “It’s the logic of a laboratory – Guaidó is like a mixture of several elements that create a character who, in all honesty, oscillates between laughable and worrying.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diego Sequera, a Venezuelan journalist and writer for the investigative outlet, Mision Verdad, agreed: “Guaidó is more popular outside Venezuela than inside, especially in the elite Ivy League and Washington circles,” Sequera remarked to the Grayzone, “He’s a known character there, is predictably right-wing, and is considered loyal to the program.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Guaidó is today sold as the face of democratic restoration, he spent his career in the most violent faction of Venezuela’s most radical opposition party, positioning himself at the forefront of one destabilization campaign after another. His party has been widely discredited inside Venezuela, and is held partly responsible for fragmenting a badly weakened opposition. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘These radical leaders have no more than 20 percent in opinion polls,” <a href="http://www.caraotadigital.net/nacionales/luis-vicente-leon-la-oposicion-politica-venezolana-vive-su-peor-momento-historico/">wrote</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luis Vicente León, Venezuela’s leading pollster. According to Leon, Guaidó’s party remains isolated because the majority of the population “does not want war. ‘What they want is a solution.’”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is precisely why he Guaidó was selected by Washington: he is not expected to lead Venezuela towards to democracy, but to collapse a country that for the past two decades has been a bulwark of resistance to US hegemony. His unlikely rise signals the culmination of a two decades-long project to destroy a robust socialist experiment.</span></p>

<p><b>Targeting the “troika of tyranny”</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the 1998 election of Hugo Chavez, the United States has fought to restore control over Venezuela and is vast oil reserves. Chavez’s socialist programs may have redistributed the country’s wealth and helped lift millions out of poverty, but they also earned him a target on his back. In 2002, Venezuela’s right-wing opposition briefly ousted him with US support and recognition before the military restored his presidency following a mass popular mobilization. Throughout the administrations of US Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Chavez survived numerous assassination plots before succumbing to cancer in 2013. His successor, Nicolas Maduro, has </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/maduro-assassination-plot-venezuela_n_3820765.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survived</span></a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2344973.stm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on his life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration immediately elevated Venezuela to the top of Washington’s regime change target list, branding it the leader of a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-national-security-advisor-ambassador-john-r-bolton-administrations-policies-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“troika of tyranny.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Last year, Trump’s national security team </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/americas/donald-trump-venezuela-military-coup.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to recruit members of the military brass to mount a military junta, but that effort failed. According to the Venezuelan government, the US was also involved in a plot codenamed Operation Constitution to capture Maduro at the Miraflores presidential palace, and another called </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/inside-the-failed-plot-to-overthrow-venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Armageddon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assassinate him at a military parade in July, 2017. Just over a year later, exiled opposition leaders </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J71BT0stT3k"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tried and failed to kill Maduro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with drone bombs during a military parade in Caracas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a decade before these intrigues, a group of right-wing opposition students were hand selected and groomed by an elite, US-funded regime change training academy to topple Venezuela’s government and restore the neoliberal order.</span></p>

<p><b>Training from the “‘export-a-revolution’ group that sowed the seeds for a NUMBER of color revolutions”</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 5, 2005, with Chavez’s popularity at its peak and his government planning sweeping socialist programs, five Venezuelan “student leaders” </span><a href="https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/venezuela-marigold-revolution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrived</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Belgrade, Serbia to begin training for an insurrection. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students had arrived from Venezuela courtesy of the Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies, or CANVAS. This group is </span><a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2013/01/14/breaking-desperate-for-destabilization-in-venezuela-us-funded-otpor-rears-its-ugly-head/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largely through the <a href="https://grayzoneproject.com/2018/08/20/inside-americas-meddling-machine-the-us-funded-group-that-interferes-in-elections-around-the-globe/">National Endowment for Democracy</a>, a CIA cut-out that functions as the US government’s main arm of promoting regime change; and offshoots like the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. According to leaked internal </span><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/17/1792423_information-on-canvas-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emails</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Stratfor, an intelligence firm known as the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/15/stratfor-canadian-government_n_4449505.html">“shadow CIA,”</a> “[CANVAS] may have also received CIA funding and training during the 1999/2000 anti-Milosevic struggle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CANVAS is a spinoff of Otpor, a Serbian protest group founded by </span><a href="http://www.williamengdahl.com/englishNEO1Oct2017.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Srdja Popovic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1998 at the University of Belgrade. Otpor, which means “resistance” in Serbian, was the student group that gained international fame – and Hollywood-level </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/143379353"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promotion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – by mobilizing the protests that eventually toppled Slobodan Milosevic. This small cell of regime change specialists was operating according to the theories of the late Gene Sharp, the so-called “Clausewitz of non-violent struggle.” Sharp had worked with a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, Col. </span><a href="http://peacemagazine.org/archive/v24n1p12.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Helvey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to conceive a strategic blueprint that weaponized protest as a form of hybrid warfare, aiming it at states that resisted Washington’s unipolar domination.</span></p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Otpor at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otpor was supported by the National Endowment for Democracy, USAID and Sharp’s Albert Einstein Institute. Sinisa Sikman, one of Otpor’s main trainers, once </span><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/17/1792423_information-on-canvas-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the group even received direct CIA funding. According to a </span><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/17/1713359_re-insight-venezuela-canvas-analysis-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a Stratfor staffer, after running Milosevic out of power, “the kids who ran OTPOR grew up, got suits and designed CANVAS… or in other words a ;export-a-revolution’ group that sowed the seeds for a NUMBER of color revolutions. They are still hooked into U.S. funding and basically go around the world trying to topple dictators and autocratic governments (ones that U.S. does not like ;).”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stratfor revealed that CANVAS “turned its attention to Venezuela” in 2005 after training opposition movements that led pro-NATO regime change operations across Eastern Europe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While monitoring the CANVAS training program, Stratfor outlined its insurrectionist agenda in strikingly blunt language: “Success is by no means guaranteed, and student movements are only at the beginning of what could be a years-long effort to trigger a revolution in Venezuela, but the trainers themselves are the people who cut their teeth on the ‘Butcher of the Balkans.’ They’ve got mad skills. When you see students at five Venezuelan universities hold simultaneous demonstrations, you will know that the training is over and the real work has begun.”</span></p>

<p><strong>Birthing the “Generation 2007” regime change cadre</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “real work” began two years later, in 2007, when Guaidó graduated from Andrés Bello Catholic University of Caracas. He moved to Washington DC to enroll in the Governance and Political Management </span><a href="http://sri.ucab.edu.ve/sites/default/files/Convenio%20UCAB-%20CAF%20George%20Washington%20University.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at George Washington University under the tutelage of Venezuelan economist Luis Enrique Berrizbeitia, one of the top Latin American neoliberal economists. Berrizbeitia is a </span><a href="https://www.caf.com/media/3571/resumenexecutive.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">former executive director</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the International Monetary Fund who spent more than a decade working in Venezuelan energy sector under the oligarchic old regime that was ousted by Chavez.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, Guaidó helped lead anti-government rallies after the Venezuelan government </span><a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2424"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to renew the license of Radio Caracas Televisión (RCTV). This privately-owned station played a leading role in the 2002 coup against Hugo Chavez. RCTV helped mobilize anti-government demonstrators, falsified information blaming government supporters for acts of violence carried out by opposition members, and banned pro-government reporting amid the coup. The role of RCTV and other oligarch-owned stations in driving the failed coup attempt was chronicled in the acclaimed documentary, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same year, the students claimed credit for stymying Chavez’s constitutional referendum for a “21st century socialism” that </span><a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2890"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “to set the legal framework for the political and social reorganization of the country, giving direct power to organized communities as a prerequisite for the development of a new economic system.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the protests around RCTV and the referendum, a specialized cadre of US-backed class of regime change activists was born. They called themselves “Generation 2007.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stratfor and CANVAS trainers of this cell identified Guaidó’s ally – a street organizer named Yon Goicoechea – as a “key factor” in defeating the constitutional referendum. The following year, Goicochea was </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/friedman-prize/yon-goicoechea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewarded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his efforts with the Cato Institute’s Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty, along with a $500,000 prize, which he promptly invested into building his own Liberty First (Primero Justicia) political network.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friedman, of course, was the godfather of the notorious neoliberal Chicago Boys who were imported into Chile by dictatorial junta leader Augusto Pinochet to implement policies of radical “shock doctrine”-style fiscal austerity.

He applauded the latter figure as “one of the students’ most articulate defenders of civil liberties.”</span></p>

<p><b>“Galvanizing public unrest…to take advantage of the situation and spin it against Chavez”</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2009, the Generation 2007 youth activists </span><a href="https://orhpositivo.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/los-culos-de-la-derecha-venezolana-al-aire-contra-chavez/#jp-carousel-2150"><span style="font-weight: 400;">staged their most provocative demonstration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet, dropping their pants on public roads and aping the outrageous guerrilla theater tactics outlined by Gene Sharp in his regime change manuals. The protesters had mobilized against the arrest of an ally from another newfangled youth group called JAVU. This far-right group “gathered funds from a variety of US government sources, which allowed it to gain notoriety quickly as the hardline wing of opposition street movements,” according to academic George Ciccariello-Maher’s book, “Building the Commune.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While video of the protest is not available, many Venezuelans have <a href="http://www.lechuguinos.com/juan-guaido-pela-nalgas/">identified</a> Guaidó as one of its key participants. While the allegation is unconfirmed, it is certainly plausible; the bare-buttocks protesters were members of the Generation 2007 inner core that Guaidó belonged to, and were clad in their trademark Resistencia! Venezuela t-shirts, as seen below:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, Guaidó exposed himself to the public in another way, founding a political party to capture the anti-Chavez energy his Generation 2007 had cultivated. Called Popular Will, it was led by <a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/11452">Leopoldo López</a>, a Princeton-educated right-wing firebrand heavily involved in National Endowment for Democracy programs and elected as the mayor of a district in Caracas that was one of the wealthiest in the country. Lopez was a portrait of Venezuelan aristocracy, directly descended from his country’s first president. He was also the first cousin of </span><a href="https://electronicintifada.net/content/oslo-freedom-forum-founders-ties-islamophobes-who-inspired-mass-killer-anders-breivik/12451"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thor Halvorssen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder of the US-based Human Rights Foundation that functions as a de facto publicity shop for US-backed anti-government activists in countries targeted by Washington for regime change. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Lopez’s interests aligned neatly with Washington’s, US </span><a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/10388"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diplomatic cables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by Wikileaks highlighted the fanatical tendencies that would ultimately lead to Popular Will’s marginalization. One cable identified Lopez as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a divisive figure within the opposition… often described as arrogant, vindictive, and power-hungry.” Others highlighted his obsession with street confrontations and his “uncompromising approach” as a source of tension with other opposition leaders who prioritized unity and participation in the country’s democratic institutions.</span></p>

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Popular Will founder Leopoldo Lopez cruising with his wife, Lilian Tintori</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2010, Popular Will and its foreign backers moved to exploit the worst drought to hit Venezuela in decades. Massive electricity shortages had struck the country due the dearth of water, which was needed to power hydroelectric plants. A global economic recession and declining oil prices compounded the crisis, driving public discontentment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stratfor and CANVAS – key advisors of Guaidó and his anti-government cadre – devised a shockingly cynical </span><a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=218642"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive a dagger through the heart of the Bolivarian revolution. The scheme hinged on a 70% collapse of the country’s electrical system by as early as April 2010. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This could be the watershed event, as there is little that Chavez can do to protect the poor from the failure of that system,” the Stratfor internal memo declared. “This would likely have the impact of galvanizing public unrest in a way that no opposition group could ever hope to generate. At that point in time, an opposition group would be best served to take advantage of the situation and spin it against Chavez and towards their needs.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this point, the Venezuelan opposition was receiving a staggering $40-50 million a year from US government organizations like USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy, according to </span><a href="https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/5441"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Spanish think tank, the FRIDE Institute. It also had massive wealth to draw on from its own accounts, which were mostly outside the country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the scenario envisioned by Statfor did not come to fruition, the Popular Will party activists and their allies cast aside any pretense of non-violence and joined a radical plan to destabilize the country. </span></p>

<p><b>Towards violent destabilization</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, 2010, according to </span><a href="https://www.aporrea.org/actualidad/n250229.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emails</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> obtained by Venezuelan security services and presented by former Justice Minister Miguel Rodríguez Torres, Guaidó, Goicoechea, and several other student activists attended a secret five-day training at the Fiesta Mexicana hotel in Mexico City. The sessions were run by Otpor, the Belgrade-based regime change trainers backed by the US government. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meeting had </span><a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/analysis/Who-is-Venezuelan-Terror-Plotter-Lorent-Saleh-Four-Former-Latin-American-Presidents-Just-Might-Know-20140924-0071.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly received the blessing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Otto Reich, a fanatically anti-Castro Cuban exile working in George W. Bush’s Department of State, and the right-wing former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Fiesta Mexicana hotel, the emails stated, Guaidó and his fellow activists hatched a plan to overthrow President Hugo Chavez by generating chaos through protracted spasms of street violence. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three petroleum industry figureheads – Gustavo Torrar, Eligio Cedeño and Pedro Burelli – allegedly covered the $52,000 tab to hold the meeting. Torrar is a self-described “human rights activist” and “intellectual” whose younger brother Reynaldo Tovar Arroyo is the representative in Venezuela of the private Mexican oil and gas company Petroquimica del Golfo, which holds a contract with the Venezuelan state. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cedeño, for his part, is a fugitive Venezuelan businessman who claimed asylum in the United States, and Pedro Burelli a former JP Morgan executive and the former director of Venezuela’s national oil company, Petroleum of Venezuela (PDVSA). He left PDVSA in 1998 as Hugo Chavez took power and is on the </span><a href="https://lalp.georgetown.edu/people/pedro-burelli"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advisory committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Georgetown University’s Latin America Leadership Program. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burelli insisted that the emails detailing his participation had been </span><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/232153227/Evidence-in-English-Evidencia-en-Castellano"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fabricated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even hired a private investigator to prove it. The investigator </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/5d93086fccd34d2c8ea5e92ca793da3b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Google’s records showed the emails alleged to be his were never transmitted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet today Burelli makes no secret of his desire to see Venezuela’s current president, Nicolás Maduro, deposed – and even dragged through the streets and sodomized with a bayonet, as Libyan leader Moammar Qaddafi was by NATO-backed militiamen. </span></p>
