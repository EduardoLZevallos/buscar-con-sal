at the Opening Ceremony of the Business Summit<br />
China-Latin America and the Caribbean 2025</strong></em></h3>

<h3><em><strong>November 3rd 2025</strong></em></h3>

<p>Comrades He Baoxiang, Head of State, Vice Chairman of the Political Consultative Committee of the People's Republic of China;</p>

<p>Comrade Ren Hongbin, Chairman of the CCPIT;</p>

<p>Comrade Liu Ling, Secretary General of the Henan Province of China.</p>

<p>Dear friends, everyone.</p>

<p>First of all, allow me to convey warm and fraternal greetings from the Co-Presidents of the Republic of Nicaragua, Comandante Daniel Ortega and Compañera Rosario Murillo, to the President of the People's Republic of China, Compañero Xi Jinping; to the Communist Party of China, to its People, to its Government, and to all those who are attending this important Event.</p>

<p>We are here to participate in this XVIII Business Summit  of China, Latin America and Caribbean, in the historic City of Zhengzhou, in the Province of Henan.</p>

<p>We are here to strengthen these Bonds of Brother and Sisterhood between Nicaragua and China, ties based on the historical fraternal relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Sandinista National Liberation Front Party of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Last year we had the honor of being the host Country of this Summit in its 17th Edition. It was a real honor that Nicaragua was selected to organize such a momentous Event. It had the participation of more than 450 Chinese businessmen, and of course the Business Community and Governments of Our Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>We would like to reiterate on this occasion that Nicaragua firmly supports all the Initiatives that have been proposed by President Xi Jinping, the Belt and Road Initiative, the Initiatives for Global Development, Global Security, Global Governance, fundamental Initiatives for a just Development, with benefit shared among Peoples. But not only for that, but also for the very preservation of the Human Species, of the Human Community.</p>

<p>In turbulent times, all these Initiatives give us a glimmer of Hope, that we can move forward together towards a Better Future.</p>

<p>We have also had the honor to participate in the Month of May in China, in Beijing, in the IV Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum; where President Xi presented the 5 Cooperation Programs, which we also fully, firmly support: The Program of Solidarity, Development, Civilizations, Peace and People-to-People Connectivity. These Programs demonstrate the commitment of President Xi of China to promote the development of the countries of the Global South, to bring cooperation to all our Peoples, based on respectful, equal treatment, without interference, without conditions.</p>

<p>That how China works around the World, promoting Peace, promoting Development, promoting Cooperation for the benefit of everyone.</p>

<p>Between Nicaragua and China we have been developing our Cooperation Relations at an extraordinary rate, in all fields, but especially in Economic and Commercial Cooperation.</p>

<p>We re-established Diplomatic Relations in 2021, and in record time we have negotiated and signed a Free Trade Agreement that entered into force in 2024.</p>

<p>This has encouraged the arrival to Nicaragua of entrepreneurs, Chinese companies that are developing investment and trade, in all fields. And we are also promoting the export of Nicaraguan products to the large Chinese market.</p>

<p>We participate annually in the China-Shanghai Import Fair, we will be there also in the next few days. And we are developing Projects with large Chinese companies, with practically all sectors of Nicaragua: Infrastructure, Telecommunications, Energy, Mining, Fishing, Agriculture, Banking, Finance; Industrialization.</p>

<p>And we are convinced that with the help of our Chinese Sisters and Brothers we are going to achieve the eradication of Extreme Poverty in Nicaragua, following the example of the great Chinese People, following the example of President Xi Jinping, who have achieved it here in China, eradicating Extreme Poverty.</p>

<p>Nicaragua and Latin America, hand in hand with the great Chinese people, can also achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Today we also want to reiterate our firm condemnation and rejection of the policies of aggression carried out by the US Government and its European allies, against China, against Nicaragua, against Venezuela, against Cuba, against the Free Peoples of the World.</p>

<p>Our firm rejection and condemnation of the so-called sanctions, economic terrorism, trade wars, tariff wars, from which no one emerges victorious.</p>

<p>These are policies hegemonism has been promoting, trying to impose its mentality and its imperial modality as it has always done. But, thanks to the great advances the People's Republic of China has achieved, we have here a fraternal People which stands up to this aggression, and accompanies us, the Free Peoples of the World, to stand up to this aggression, united as we move forward, striving for our Sovereignty, Dignity and Complete Freedom.</p>

<p>We also want to reiterate our firm defense of the Principle of One China. Nicaragua remains and will remain firm, defending that Principle in all the Organizations and Forums in which we share with the People's Republic of China. And we aspire to and have faith in the reunification of this great People.</p>

<p>We are following up on the Special Relationship that exists between Nicaragua and China, following the example of the great Initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping, in order to promote trade and investment with our Brothers and Sisters in the People's Republic of China, based on our Strategic Partnership, because our relationship is already a Strategic Partnership.</p>

<p>Our Government has approved, through the National Assembly, the Law creating the Belt and Road Special Economic Zones Initiative in Nicaragua.<br />
Through this Initiative, all companies, especially Chinese companies operating under this regime in Nicaragua, will be exempt from all taxes for the entire time they operate in our country, and will have mechanisms to facilitate the installation and operation of their companies in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>We will also have preferential arrangements on Energy, on Industrial Limits, and the possibility of having State lands available for Investment Programs and Projects, as well as facilitation mechanisms through a Single Office attending to port, maritime, and air management.</p>

<p>Because these are companies that dedicated especially to transformation, industrialization, processing, and there is greater productivity in our country for exports, so as to generate many thousands of jobsr investment, and greater economic and commercial dynamism. So, we want to reiterate our gratitude for taking us into account to attend this Opening Ceremony. And we want to reiterate, that as Brothers and Sisters, we are going to support our Chinese Brothers and Sisters.</p>

<p>And to our Latin American Brothers and Sisters, let us be united with our Chinese Sisters and Brothers, so as to make progress towards the Development and Well-being of our Peoples.</p>

<p>May you all enjoy success in your work during this Summit.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
