      <span style="font-weight: normal;">By Karla Jacobs,

      <br>
Given that our coverage has
been
almost entirely dedicated to the ongoing crisis in Honduras since the
coup d'etat against President Manuel Zelaya at the end of June, we
thought it necessary to provide readers with a brief summary of
important recent Nicaraguan news items. The following news items are
covered in this report:<br>
      <ul>

      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Internal
reactions to the Honduran crisis</span><br>
      <br>
The most active and outspoken member of
the
Nicaraguan opposition on the subject of the Honduran crisis has been
the US Embassy's repeatedly-failed&nbsp;candidate Eduardo
Montealegre. Montealegre
became the first and only political figure outside Honduras to actually
travel to that country to meet with coup president Roberto Micheletti.
During his two day trip to Tegucigalpa last week Montealegre stated
that what had occurred in Honduras was not a coup but a "constitutional
succession" provoked by "irregularities" committed by Manuel Zelaya. <br>
      <br>
Montealegre even went as far as calling on the "liberal parties of
Latin America to view the situation in Honduras from a broader
perspective. This is not a struggle between left and right but between
dictatorship and democracy." His words should be taken to represent
what his patrons at the State Department really think about the coup
but can't get away with saying in public. <br>
      <br>
Similar statements have been made by other Nicaraguan right wing
politicians. When asked for his opinion on the Honduran crisis Eliseo
N&uacute;nez, a key member of Montealegre's mini political movement,
went as far as saying "there was no coup in Honduras. Here we need to
throw out Daniel Ortega anyway we can. What I would like is to see
Daniel Ortega disappear."<br>
      <br>
Right wing forces and the corporate media have been extremely critical
of the government's decision to allow Manuel Zelaya and a varying
number of Hondurans (who fled the military repression) to stay and
carry out meetings in the northern town of Ocotal. According to these
forces, which have demanded that Zelaya be expelled, the presence of
the Hondurans on the Nicaraguan side of the border is a threat to
Nicaragua's security.<br>
      <br>
Spooked by the insistence by right wing figures such as the PLC's
Wilfredo Navarro that an imminent
threat of conflict in the Ocotal region existed, the independent left
wing Radio
La Primer&iacute;sima published an article warning of a possible plan
to
provoke out and
out conflict
between the two countries arranging for
paramilitaries
dressed as Nicaraguan soldiers to shoot at Honduran soldiers on the
border.<br>
      <br>
On July 31st, during his speech as part of the 30th anniversary
celebrations of the founding of the Nicaraguan Air Force, President
Daniel Ortega mentioned the possibility of the existence of such a plan
saying "Nicaragua does not want war with anybody. I insist, Nicaragua
does not want war."<br>
      <br>
Ortega went on to call on the Honduran military to "rectify it's very
grave mistake" saying that, in the event of a political agreement to
bring the crisis to an end, the ones who are likely to pay the price
for the crimes committed are not the political leaders who provoked the
coup but the military officials who carried it out.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Official visit from
high level
Russian delegation</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">
      <br>
On July 28th Daniel Ortega and Government
Spokesperson
Rosario Murillo welcomed a high level Russian delegation led by Vice
Prime Minister Igor Sechin on official visit to Nicaragua. During the
event Sechin gave Ortega two letters, one from Russian President
Dmitriv Medvedev and the other from Russian Primer Minister Vladimir
Putin. Both letters expressed the Russian government's full disposition
to strengthen and broaden cooperation with Nicaragua in all fields. <br>
      <br>
As well as Vice Prime Minister Sechin, the Russian delegation included
many other important officials such as the Energy Minister, the Foreign
Minister, the Director of Military Cooperation and the Vice Minister
of Trade and Commerce. <br>
      <br>
Among other things Ortega requested assistance from the Russian
government to "modernize" Nicaragua's armed forces. This is necessary,
he said, not in order to project Nicaragua as a threat to any other
nation, but in order to be able to effectively carry out the fight
against international drug trafficking and organized crime. Ortega has
made similar requests to the US government which have been rejected. <br>
      <br>
During the Russian delegation's visit a number of bilateral treaties
were signed in the areas of industrial fishing, migration and
petroleum. As part of the agreements, Russia will provide support to
increase Nicaragua's industrial fishing capacity, Nicaraguans and
Russians will be able to visit each other's countries without the need
to obtain a visa prior to arrival, and Russian petroleum companies will
carry out joint exploration studies with Nicaragua's
state oil company
Petronic in Nicaragua's
Pacific and
Caribbean waters.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">US concedes
property waiver </span><br>
      <br>
On July 31st the US State Department informed the
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel Santos of the decision to grant
Nicaragua what is known as the property "waiver" for another year. This
means that US aid will continue to Nicaragua and the US won't boycott
financial assistance to Nicaragua from international financial
institutions for the next twelve months. <br>
      <br>
According to US legislation aid should be suspended to any country that
at some point implemented a policy of confiscating property from US
citizens, or from people who later became US citizens. This applies to
Nicaragua given that, although the 1980s land reform affected very few
US citizens, a large number of former National Guard members and other
Nicaraguan oligarchs who abandoned the country and later had property
confiscated as part of the land reform, later became US citizens. <br>
      <br>
In order to be awarded a one year "waiver" or exemption from the
relevant US sanctions, the Nicaraguan government must be seen to make
"significant" progress in providing compensation to those US (formerly
Nicaraguan) citizens who had land confiscated in the 80s. <br>
      <br>
Between July 2008 and July 2009 Nicaragua resolved 48 compensation
claim cases for 32 US citizens. Despite this apparently "significant"
progress, US Ambassador Robert Callahan had recently suggested that the
"waiver" would not be granted to Nicaragua this year.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Government to
present tax reform
proposal</span><br>
      <br>
Treasury Minister, Alberto Guevara, and President of
the
Central Bank, Antenor Rosales, announced plans to present the
government's tax reform proposal as soon as the current round of
negotiations with International Monetary Fund (IMF) come to an end. <br>
      <br>
The latest round of talks with an IMF technical delegation began in
Managua on August 3rd. Topics on the agenda include the tax reform
proposal, mechanisms to strengthen the Nicaraguan Social Security
Institute, and economic projections for 2010. <br>
      <br>
The talks follow a period of dispute between the two parts provoked by
the IMF's attempt to impose certain financial reforms the Nicaraguan
government considered damaging. In the end Nicaragua was able to impose
its will and did not implement the reforms proposed by the IMF. <br>
      <br>
The subject of the long overdue tax reform in Nicaragua is a matter the
de facto economic powers operating in Nicaragua have tried to keep off
the agenda as long as possible. Big business, both Nicaraguan and
international, enjoy a completely unjustifiable array of tax benefits
and exemptions within the country while the impoverished majority make
up for taxes the rich are allowed to evade paying high levels of
consumption tax on all food and other basic products. <br>
      <br>
Rosales said the reform proposal aims to "improve the tax system,
making it fairer and more effective in terms of fomenting the national
productive capacity." Left of centre critics of the government are
sceptical about the possibility that big business will be significantly
affected by the government's tax reform proposal given that, until now,
the government has avoided stepping on COSEP's toes. <br>
      <br>
COSEP, the main
private sector organization, proved itself an important ally for the
government recently when, as part of the previously mentioned dispute,
big business representatives travelled to Washington with the
government delegation to convince the IMF to back off. <br>
      <br>
No matter how soft the government decides to be on big business,
though, an inevitably intense or even explosive process of
consultations and amendments involving mainly the private sector,
producers and workers, is almost certain to take place after the
presentation of the government tax reform proposal. A final version of
the proposal should be included in the executive's 2010 Budget proposal
which will be sent to the National Assembly no later than October 15th.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Nicaragua declared
free of
illiteracy</span><br>
      <br>
On
July 19th, as part of the celebrations of the 30th anniversary of the
triumph of the Popular Sandinista Revolution, Nicaragua became the
fourth country in Latin America to be declared free of illiteracy. (The
other three countries to have been declared free of illiteracy are
Cuba,
Venezuela and Bolivia). <br>
      <br>
In June a delegation from UNESCO (the
UN Education, Science and Culture Organization) visited Nicaragua and
was able to confirm that indeed the percentage of the Nicaraguan
population unable to read and write has dropped to below 5% for the
first time in the nation's history. The exact percentage of illiteracy
among the population was determined as 4.1% after an extensive study
involving samples of the population from each of Nicaragua's 153
municipalities.<br>
      <br>
The first stage of the National Literacy
Campaign called "de Mart&iacute; a Fidel" was made possible thanks to
Cuban
and Venezuelan cooperation in terms of technical, logistical and
financial support. The teaching method used during the campaign is the
Cuban "Yo S&iacute; Puedo" method. <br>
      <br>
The&nbsp;vast majority of teachers and
educators who worked on the literacy campaign are young Nicaraguans,
often accompanied and supported by teams of Venezuelan and Cuban
teachers.<br>
      <br>
On July 31st the second stage of the National Literacy
Campaign called "Sandino Vive ... la lucha sigue" began. This phase
aims to reduce the illiteracy rate to 3% by 8th November 2009, the
commemoration of Carlos Fonseca's death in combat. The Ministry of
Education has identified the areas worst affected by the scourge of
illiteracy are Jinotega and the Atlantic Autonomous Regions (RAAN and
RAAS). Efforts are therefore now being focussed on these specific areas
of the country.<br>
      <br>
Simultaneously, 300,000 of the over 500,000
adults (between the ages of 15 and 65) who learnt to read and write as
part of the first stage ("de Mart&iacute; a Fidel") of the campaign,
are now
enrolled in a program called "Yo, S&iacute; Puedo Seguir," which is a
special
accelerated primary education course for adults. <br>

      <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Agriculture
Minister: 2009 harvest
likely to supersede expectations </span><br>
      <br>
Minister
of Agriculture, Ariel Bucardo, is confident that this year's harvest of
basic grains and other important crops like coffee and sugar will
supersede official projections. The government had projected a slight
increase on production compared to 2008. Bucardo is now confident that
aim will easily be met. So
far this year climatic conditions have been favourable in most of the
country resulting in a low proportion of crops being lost to lack or
excess of rain. <br>
      <br>
The government's policy of providing high quality
certified seed and fertilizer to small and medium farmers and
agricultural cooperatives at accessible prices or as a loan with
favourable payback conditions has meant a larger percentage of arable
land is being used, and farmers are achieving significantly higher
yields. <br>
      <br>
The FSLN government's agricultural policy forms part of its overall
food security and food
sovereignty policy which has been praised by the FAO
(UN Food and Agricultural Organization) on
a number of occasions. According to recently published FAO figures the
government's food policy has resulted in an almost 30 point drop in the
percentage of the Nicaraguan population suffering from malnourishment.</td>
