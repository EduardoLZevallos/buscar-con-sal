Unida Nicaragua Triunfa</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/bandera_nacional.jpg.html" /></p>

<p><strong>SPEECH BY AMBASSADOR LUIS ALVARADO<br />
AT THE MEETING OF THE PERMANENT COUNCIL<br />
OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES OAS ON JUNE 15, 2021</strong></p>

<p>Thank you very much Mr. President,</p>

<p>The delegation of the Government of Nicaragua disapproves of the convening of this Permanent Council, which has not been requested or authorized by the Government of Nicaragua, and therefore strongly rejects it, as well as the resolution that it intends to impose on the sovereign State of Nicaragua, which we have already declared inadmissible and absolute null, lacking of any binding effect on the Government of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
We condemn the interfering practice of this discredited organization and its Secretary General in the affairs of Nicaragua's domestic jurisdiction and that of other Member States of this Organization.</p>

<p>The OAS is in rebellion and collision with the principles of international law, by continuing to violate the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and its own founding charter, which establishes that the Organization of American States has no powers other than those expressly conferred on it by this Charter, none of provisions of which, hear it loud and clear, authorizes it to intervene in matters within the jurisdiction of its Member States.</p>

<p>We denounce and condemn the policy of interfering, of blackmail, of illegal coercive measures through the so-called sanctions that are nothing more than aggressions by the United States Government against Nicaraguan citizens, who keep high the dignity and national pride of our nation.</p>

<p>We condemn the blackmail and pressure that the imperial power has exerted against the Member States of this Organization, so that they agree to submit to the directives of the Government of the United States, in its campaign of aggression and the media war of misrepresentation of the national reality.</p>

<p>The interventionist policy of the Government of the United States, and of the countries that join this action of interference against the sovereign State of Nicaragua, are responsible for the fragmentation, lack of relevance and atomization of the OAS, which fails to detach itself from its monothematic agenda, still pigeonholed in the era of the cold war and neocolonialism, which has as its corollary the division, destabilization and confrontation within this organization and in the regional political environment, all of this with the aim of imposing the dictates of Washington on the countries of the region.</p>

<p>Mr. President, there can be no peace in the world as long as the United States continues to apply the carrot-and-stick doctrine at the international and regional levels and persists in continuing to create hotbeds of military tension in various regions of the world, putting international peace and security at serious risk.</p>

<p>The actions of political and economic aggression by the US Government, through the application of sanctions must cease now, they have no future, are not viable, are unpresentable, their practice is inhumane, and they violate the UN Charter, the principles of international law and good faith relations between States, as well as the principles and rules of the World Trade Organization.</p>

<p>These practices are widely rejected by the international community even by its own European partners, and we therefore, demand the elimination of unilateral coercive measures imposed on various sovereign States of the world, institutions or individuals, emphasizing that their application is illegal and constitutes a crime against humanity.</p>

<p>It is time for the United States, as a nation, to detach itself from the Monroe Doctrine and decide to work for peace, for the promotion of respectful relations of trade and cooperation between States, of the right to sovereignty and self-determination for all the nations of the world, currently governed by a multipolar international context with the presence of other important actors on the world stage.</p>

<p>If there is one lesson to be drawn from this COVID-19 pandemic, it is that only through promotion of peace, security and international cooperation can we get ahead as States, in this global health crisis, avoiding inequity and politicization in the distribution of vaccines.</p>

<p>In the face of the aggressions of the colonial powers of the world, Nicaragua will continue to defend with aplomb and selflessness, the dignity of the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean. With patriotic pride, we defend our right to peace and citizen security, so that hatred between Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers may never again be engendered.</p>

<p>We defend our right to self-determination and to decide among Nicaraguans our internal affairs and to exercise our right to exist as a sovereign and independent free nation, which we will not let be sullied by traitors, patricians, the imperial powers or by an irrelevant and discredited organization such as the OAS.</p>

<p>They are baffled that Nicaragua, in the full exercise of its national sovereignty, applies its legal system and its laws, which paradoxically were inspired by the existing national legislations in the countries that are currently colluding against the Nicaraguan nation, which have these laws and apply them in their respective countries.</p>

<p>It hurts them and they are annoyed by the international recognition that Nicaragua enjoys, of being a retaining wall for drug trafficking and transnational organized crime.</p>

<p>They are scandalized because we investigate and effectively combat corruption, the laundering of money, property and assets, criminality and terrorism in its various manifestations, and because we combat the crimes of treason and alliances with foreign powers to  promote terrorism, death, torture, sedition to try to overthrow, with the financing of foreign powers, a government legitimately elected by the Nicaraguan people; affecting peace and national security.</p>

<p>These are all crimes of gravity and high treason, which are defined in many legislations around the world.</p>

<p>We call on the interfering countries that hypocritically criticize Nicaragua for the actions and judicial and legislative measures that you yourselves include within your own legislations and apply in your respective countries.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is a country of laws with full and effective separation of State powers, which asserts its institutionality and its national legal system and also has an extensive legal tradition.</p>

<p>Nicaragua's national sovereignty is not disputed, we defend it with the weapons of justice and the application of national laws in the face of acts that violate the domestic legal system and our constitutional provisions.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is nobody's colony, we will continue to defend national dignity and decorum and our right to peace, to live free from threats, conspiracies and foreign interventions, in the face of neocolonial pretensions that refuse to recognize the sovereignty of our homeland and our right to self-determination.</p>

<p>Thank you very much Mr. President.</p>
