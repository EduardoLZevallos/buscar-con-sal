<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; text-align: justify; font-style: italic;">"After
poverty, illiteracy is the most destructive form of social violence
available to those who
benefit from national economic production. Illiteracy does not just
destroy a
person's self respect, but dissolves human dignity and, together with
poverty,
ends up transforming men into disposable tools and victims of
alcoholism, drug
addiction and prostitution. General A.C. Sandino understood this
problem and expressed his desire to eliminate illiteracy among the army
of
campesinos that helped him defeat the [US] invaders.<br>
<br>
During the bloody
Somocista military dictatorship, illiteracy was necessary and expedient
in
facilitating the [dictatorship's] ransacking of Nicaragua. Within
the Sandinista
Front, led by Carlos Fonseca, education of illiterate [members]
was always a
fundamental component of the revolutionary program. From within the
Somocista system,
in 1964, the newspaper La Prensa promoted a literacy campaign
which reached
50,000 people with the support of 5,000 brigadistas.<br>
<br>
This campaign
demonstrated popular support for the idea of eradicating illiteracy but
was attacked and
oppressed by the Somoza dictatorship despite the fact that the campaign
did not
attempt to raise awareness about social issues." (1)</div>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">General Sandino
was proud of the fact that "the number of illiterate
officials [in the ranks of my army] could be counted on the fingers of
one hand
with a few left over," but lamented that "a lack of teachers and other
elements"
meant that the achievements of an attempt to reduce illiteracy among
the soldiers
"were barely perceptible." (2) Four decades later founder of the FSLN
(Sandinista Front for National Liberation), Carlos Fonseca, promised
the campesinos
who supported the Sandinista guerrillas that one of the first things a
revolutionary government would do would be to carry out a massive
literacy campaign.
(3)<br>
<br>
Before the triumph of the revolution in 1979 a special work team within
the FSLN had drafted a plan for the proposed national literacy
campaign. This
plan was taken up by Fernando Cardenal, appointed coordinator of the
National
Literacy Crusade (CNA) by the Government of National Reconstruction in
early
August 1979, just a couple of weeks after FSLN troops marched
triumphant into
Managua.<br>
<br>
Cardenal studied successful literacy programs in other countries
including Cuba and Mozambique, using those countries' experiences to
come up with the
CNA's workbook El Amanecer del Pueblo (the Dawn of the People) and
set
about coordinating the training of 95,582 literacy brigadiers. These
brigadiers made up the Popular Literacy Army which, on March 24 1980
swore faithfulness
to the crusade's objectives and the FSLN's revolutionary principles
before
setting out to the most marginalized and remote parts of the country.<br>
<br>
The events which followed have been set down in history as one of the
most successful educational achievements of human kind. In just five
months
the Popular Literacy Army, consisting of nearly 100,000 Nicaraguan
students, teachers, health workers, office workers and housewives
worked together
with the most impoverished sectors of Nicaraguan society to reduce the
literacy
rate from 50.36% to 12.94% (see table below).<br>
<br>
On August 23 1980 the high command of the Popular Literacy Army issued
a statement to inform "the National Directorate of the FSLN, the
Government of National Reconstruction, our heroic people and the world
... that after
five months of arduous struggle in the countryside, mountains and
cities of
Nicaragua we have taught 406,056 Nicaraguans to read and write."(4)<br>
<br>
The table below shows the literacy rate before and after the crusade in
the seventeen different departments of Nicaragua, and (in the final
column)
in the country as a whole. The initial literacy rate figures are based
on a
census carried out by the Popular Literacy Army prior to the CNA.<br>

<br>
<div style="" justify="">Twenty six years
later, on August 23 2006 the FSLN announced it was
implementing a new National Literacy Campaign with the aim of
counteracting the
increase of the illiteracy rate thanks to 16 years of neo liberal
governments.
According to UNICEF the illiteracy rate stood at 23% in 2005,(5)
although experts
agree it could be a lot higher. The FSLN, at that point in opposition,
controlled 87 of the 153 local governments. It was this fact that
enabled the party to
carry out a successful literacy campaign benefiting close to 100,000
Nicaraguans
in less than a year. <br>
<br>
The implementation of the National Literacy Campaign has been made
possible with financial and technical support from Cuba and Venezuela.
The campaign
is based on the Cuban method Yo, Sí Puedo (Yes I Can) which has also
been used
as the basis for similar campaigns in numerous countries in the region
including Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina and Bolivia.<br>
<br>
In June 2007, with the FSLN now in government, the Ministry of
Education took over coordination of the National Literacy Campaign.
This has increased
access to financial, infrastructural and other resources for the
continued and
extended implementation of the project. <br>
<br>
In June 2008 Mario Rivera, coordinator of the National Literacy
Campaign, informed the national press about a census being carried out
by the
National Union of Students of Nicaragua (UNEN) and the Sandinista Youth
"19th of
July." This census will inform what Rivera described as the "final
offensive"
of the campaign which aims to eradicate illiteracy from Nicaragua
altogether
by July 19 2009, to mark the 30th anniversary of the Popular Sandinista
Revolution.<br>
<br>
According to figures provided recently by Rivera over 21,000 young
people (mainly secondary and university students) have taught 274,097
people
to read and write at more than 15,600 learning points which have popped
up in
town halls, churches, individual houses and other centers in all 153
municipalities of the country. (6) Among other tangible achievements of
the campaign,
Managua and another forty municipalities have been declared illiteracy
free
zones.<br>
<br>
The Yo, Sí Puedo workbooks have been translated into the main
indigenous languages of Nicaragua's Caribbean coast where literacy
classes are
taking place in dozens of indigenous communities. The Ministry of
Education is also
working to extend access to literacy classes for deaf, blind and
disabled
people. On top of this literacy classes are offered to prisoners in
most of the
country's jails.<br>
<br>
On August 23 2008, as part of the celebrations of the 28th anniversary
of the National Literacy Crusade, thousands of young people involved in
today's literacy campaign took part in an event in Managua. Among the
speakers
were numerous students who have given classes in impoverished barrios
and
communities over the last two years and representatives of the main
student and
youth movements involved - the UNEN, the Federation of Secondary
Students
(FES) and the Sandinista Youth "19th of July."<br>
<br>
During the event President Daniel Ortega swore in 2,000 new members of
the Sandinista Youth and spoke about the importance of young people in
the
current process of change and how today's literacy campaign is a threat
to the
FSLN's adversaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
"Of course all this [the actions and achievements of young people as
part of the literacy campaign and other social programs] worries the
oligarchy and
their sell-out allies, it worries those who do not care about the
people and
who are saying ... Look how many young people [the government has
mobilized].
What will<br>
they say? That we are training terrorists, that all of you are
terrorists. Terrorists who set off bombs ... yes, we are going to set
off bombs [to eradicate] extreme poverty, so that extreme poverty
disappears; yes, we
are going to set off bombs ... so that ignorance disappears. This is
the
strength of youth, a youth armed with consciousness, fortified in the
ideology of a Revolution which triumphed on the 19th of July 1979 and
is here to stay
in Nicaragua, and is here to stay in Central America, in Latin America,
in
the world.<br>
<br>
I consider you all as the children of Andres Castro, you are the
children of Zeledón, the children of Sandino, the children of Fonseca.
... Today more than ever, the mobilization of young people is a
determining
force for the eradication of illiteracy, ... it is determinant in order
to
continue strengthening groups like Builders of the Present and the
Future, ... to continue strengthening the Ecological Brigades, the
brigades in defense
of the environment. ...<br>
<br>
How nervous ... our adversaries will be watching the faces of the young
people [here today]! And they will say that you are fanatics, that you
are
terrorists, and who knows what else they will say, that you are not
democratic,
that this is a dictatorship, ... like they say every day.<br>
<br>
Their [régime] was a dictatorship, when they deprived people of health
care. Their [régime] was a dictatorship when they stole the people's
education away for 16 years. ... In reality selfishness and capitalism
has driven them
mad. Pope John Paul II spoke of "savage capitalism ... [he said] that
the
people, the poor cannot wait." The Nicaraguan youth cannot wait and
here you are to
wage these battles." (7)<br>
<br>
Without a doubt one of the FSLN's objectives in implementing the
National Literacy Campaign is to strengthen and expand support among
young
people. From a purely cynical point of view critics might argue that
the FSLN is
trying to increase support from young people with populist programs in
order to
secure votes and remain in power (the majority of Nicaraguans liable to
vote
are under 30). This argument is used over and again by critics of
Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez and his government's social programs. <br>
<br>
Those who believe in the FSLN leadership's ideological integrity,
however, argue that, the effort to encourage young people's support of
and
participation in social programs goes beyond crude populism. In 1980
Fernando Cardenal
described two of the main objectives of the CNA to be "to promote the
participation of young people in the process of national change" and
"to take advantage
of the mobilization of young people to begin other projects of national
interest." (8)<br>
<br>
Only time will tell what the real social and political implications are
for Nicaragua as a result of the country's second national literacy
campaign in 30 years.<br>
