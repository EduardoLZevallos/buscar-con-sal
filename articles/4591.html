<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Good afternoon, Compañera and a very good afternoon too, Beloved Families of this Nicaragua of Ours, Faithful, Devout, full of Hope and the Strength of Spirit that God lets flow out upon our People. Because these are God's people. Therefore, it is with that immovable Faith and that growing Strength that we Go Onward, filled with the Great Power of God, which is manifested precisely in our Blessed Nicaragua, Blessed with Love, Blessed with Hope, with Harmony, with Work, Security and Joy... The Joy of Living in Peace!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And so we are Going Onward and have received, at the threshold of the 45/19 Anniversary, an excellent survey that puts in perspective the Government of the People-President... In what kind of perspective? One of extraordinary statistics, which belie, precisely, all the nonsense and wretchedness of those who see Nicaragua with their eyes and their hearts demeaned by Hatred.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">It totally exposes their fallacy, totally exposes the little World they have created for themselves, because no one believes them. A World of lies, a World of falsehood, a World of hypocrisy. How much hypocrisy do we not see when they say they miss Nicaragua, that they love Nicaragua, and on the other hand how their profile is always that of enemies of Nicaragua, wishing Evil to Nicaragua's Families.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In this survey there is support for Unity, for Reconciliation, with approval of more than 80%; there is the matter of correct leadership, with approval for the Government of the People-President and for our Comandante Daniel, of 83.2%, of 82.4%. The hope generated by this Government of the People-President is felt by 91.8%.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">How those fools must suffer...! But we don't want to see anyone suffer, we don't wish suffering on anyone. We are not promoters of Hate. We are Promoters of the Common Good, , as we have always been, Promoters of Affection, of Rights, of Dreams being Realized, Dreams being fulfilled. And here we have the Truths.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">For satisfaction of living in Nicaragua, 89%. And so we can continue. There is also a great deal of Tranquility and Security, 85.4%... Hope, Hope, Hope! On the wings of Hope, the Hope no one can take from us, because God lets it flow over Nicaragua and over our Hearts.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">The Public Order Institutions, our Police, our Army, are approved by more than 93%. This is the way it is, this is the Reality, this is the Good Life that we Nicaraguans want and now have. This is the Real Truth.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">When one offers Love, the World improves. That is the Real Truth. With hatred it is destroyed. With hatred we destroy ourselves. With hatred we are petty, diminished, wretched. With Love we are great, because we live full of Faith. Love is Faith, Love is Power, Love is Hope, Love is Trust, Love is Assuredness, Love is Power... The Great Power of God!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So we are, and at the threshold, as we said, of the 45/19 Anniversary growing in Love, in Harmony, in Concord, in Respect, in Understanding, in Unity for the Common Good. We grow and how we grow, because Love strengthens, Love can do everything, and Love conquers everything!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And all the adverse circumstances, which the enemies of Love have created, are precisely the source of meanness and misery, we say this every day. They are precisely the expression of the Greatest Evil, which is lack of love, and an Evil that not only reaches others, as we have said, but one that rebounds, returning to those who are filled with Malignancy.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">After all, we read often that they resent us telling the Truth, but in fact the Truth is what represents us, it is the Truth that we live, the Truth that we create together every day: Rights for the People from the People, A Better Present, a Brighter Future.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Ours is a History of Victories, and as we also say every day, this vexes those who believe neither in History nor in Victories, because they belong nowhere, they are nowhere, they have no life of their own... Instead, they promote pain, suffering and misfortune for Nicaraguans. They are neither People of Peace, nor Good People, nor People who are decent and upright. That is indeed so.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">They crawl around there... Failures, dragging themselves along! So let them realize: With Hatred, Never Again! Let them realize that it is not hatred and servility, being lackeys to the sempiternal invaders, that will allow them to feel content or fulfilled. Because that Fullfilment and Joy is reached only when one lives out Love, Fraternity, Brotherhood, Solidarity, Complementarity, building the Human Being, the Society, the Better Country that we all want.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Today we presented diplomatic credentials in Equatorial Guinea to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Brother Simeon Oyono Esono, and tomorrow to the President, Compañero Obiang Nguma Mbasog. In the Presidential Palace, tomorrow, July 11th representing us there will be the Compañera who was the Procurator of Human Rights Prosecutor and President of our Youth, Compañera Darling Ríos, who is our Ambassador to Angola and from Angola she is concurrent with the Heroic People of Equatorial Guinea, its Authorities and its Government.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We also want to thank the presence of such Brother and Sister Communicators who come from the Real Truth, who work for the Real Truth via Meetings, Exchanges, Trainings and Visits whereby they Recognize the Brother and Sisterhood we have, the Historical Ties that unite us, in this Moment in which as a Human Family we struggle to overcome Hatred and achieve more and more Peace.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, Compañer@s, today the RT Compañeras and Compañeros arrive, and there is a Program of arrivals, reception, reports and trainings of Journalists, Brothers and Sisters from practically all over the World.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We have Women's Police Stations opening these days; the first one is in Muy Muy, Matagalpa.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Then, Compañer@s, the Legal Act of Concession of Family Coexistence, has benefited 1,500 People from the different prisons of the National Penitentiary System, in Commemoration and Gratitude to God for all this History of Victories.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">When we reach 45 Years of Unyielding Struggle, of Irrepressible Struggle, when we reach that 45/19 Anniversary, we recognize the Right of People who for various reasons have made mistakes in Life but who have precisely the possibility, the chance of returning to their Homes under a Regime of Family Coexistence.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I can already imagine the headlines of the little newspapers whose comic strip figures do not recognize the Rights of the humblest people. No, because they are of humble origin, they have no Rights. Only people who have sabotaged Peace have rights, and those who belong to them, to their army of outlaws... Army? It's not even that. Their bands, their small outlaw gangs.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We were attacked once for calling them minuscule, but they are minuscule. It's True! It is the Truth! Non-existent minuscules!<br />
 </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But well, those few of them who were left behind and who are serving time for having attacked Nicaraguan families and their Right to live working, quiet and safe, they must be set free.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But humble people, who have Families and children, and who have made mistakes, but who have also been able to learn, because the Prison System has Technical and Technological Training Workshops where people have graduated, people have become literate and received various types of Instruction, especially Technical, to work and contribute to their Families, they are not granted anything.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">What selfishness! Such selfishness! And it is racism too, racism indeed, because all those enemies of Peace and of the People are racist, they think they're superior, including even a few people who come from humble backgrounds, but still they think they're superior... They've been infected! They are people like us, mestizos, but by being in contact with white people they make believe that they too are white and forget about their own People, whom they reject at all times and for whom they wish evil, via slander and, above all, misfortune.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">But well, God's Great Power with the People, His People, the People of Nicaragua, both defending us and driving us, gives us more and more Strength, more and more Energy, to advance in the Common Good.</p>
