<h3><strong>Meeting of High Authorities of the Area of Communications and Information<br />
of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-Peoples' Trade Agreement, ALBA-TCP</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>12 April, 2021</strong></h3>

<p><br />
Ambassador Sacha Llorenti, Executive Secretary of ALBA-TCP;</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers, Authorities of the Institutions of the Area of Communications and Information of our Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-Peoples' Trade Agreement, ALBA-TCP.</p>

<p>1. From Nicaragua we salute all the communicators of the Great Motherland, that audacious effort of both women and men communicators, whom do not give in or surrender to the abuses and outrages of imperial policies. Here we are growing and sprouting from the seeds of Sandino, Che, Martí and Bolívar; defending the decorum of the Great Motherland.</p>

<p>2. From ALBA, today more than ever, we must strengthen our communication policy, using all the possible tools to promote the unity and integration of our peoples and our coordinated action.</p>

<p>3. Here we are with courage and hope, battling from these new fronts of struggle; from the digital, the unconventional, the wars of the fourth generation and post-truths; opposing at all times Love, that can and always will conquers all, against Hate, Infamy, Slander, Lies.</p>

<p>4. From ALBA, we make the call to strengthen joint and coordinated practical actions that will allow us to envision our goals, our struggles and victories; as well as the great challenges from the authentic leadership of our peoples. From the principles of ALBA, cooperation, solidarity and complementarity.</p>

<p>5. The Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN) has been developing in a constant and sustained manner, a communication strategy that highlights the leading role and complementarity of the Nicaraguan families. Our communication model defends popular leadership in all areas.</p>

<p>6. Nicaragua reiterates the inalienable right to sovereignty, self-determination and solidarity among our peoples, principles that unite us with the values of our Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America - Peoples' Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP).</p>

<p>7. Our Nicaragua has been a member of ALBA-TCP, since 2007 and together with the rest of our sister countries, we soar with the flag of Social Justice. This initiative of the immortal Comandantes Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro, represents more than a just and complementary commercial treaty, but a space where our peoples ratify their decision to live in peace and work for the common interest, while rejecting and condemning imperialist aggressions.</p>

<p>8. We are worthy nations that do not surrender in the face of any imperial master and that we do not accept to live as slaves. The history of our peoples' struggle is kept alive within our people and highlights the national pride of Latin America and the Caribbean. We are an example of struggle and honor.</p>

<p>9. From the ALBA-TCP, we have advanced in new forms of exchange that move away from the selfishness of savage capitalism. It is the Humanism that is reflected in the faces of millions of colleagues who inhabit our lands.</p>

<p>10. From the different spaces and forms of communication we must continue the task of showing the world that a new model of commercial relationship, of respect and friendship, is possible in the midst of so much cannibalism and greed of the capitalist model. The imperialists lack the principles, values, and even more so, the sensitivity to address the difficulties and pains of citizens.</p>

<p>11. The COVID 19 Pandemic has yet again highlighted the weaknesses and the abandonment of the neoliberal model. Many people have died because they have not had access to the health system, precisely because of the privatization of medical services.</p>

<p>12. Right now, our fight must focus on denouncing the unfair attitudes of some rich countries to monopolize vaccines against COVID-19, in a clear display of contempt for life. The impoverished world cries out for justice and equity in the access to vaccines.</p>

<p>13. Nicaragua joins the humanitarian vision of articulating, from the communicational perspective, the common effort of effective models, which have allowed the countries that make up the ALBA-TCP to improve the tools and structures to fight COVID-19.</p>

<p>14. Nicaragua, in particular, can share the effectiveness of its communication methods, from where it has successfully developed an entire educational campaign on the pandemic phenomenon.</p>

<p>15. Our communication model accompanies the protagonism of women in all areas of national life: political, economic and social. Thanks to the policies applied by the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity (GRUN), Nicaragua was recently recognized by the UN as the country that has the first place in the prominence of women, both regionally and globally, with 58.82% in ministries headed by women. Our media disseminate and promote the rights of women from their own protagonism.</p>

<p>16. The Nicaraguan Youth develops and promotes different communication initiatives such as the Youth Communicators Network, which has a presence in the 154 municipalities of the country, where young communication enthusiasts contribute and develop actions for the transmission of values to the Nicaraguan families, as well as the construction of a culture of peace in Nicaragua. Through youth participation, inclusive policies have been promoted for the empowerment and leadership of Nicaraguan youth in the social, economic, cultural, sports and environmental spheres, in order to apply technological and communication skills in defense of mother earth.</p>

<p>17. We accompany the support programs for thousands of enterprises and the family economy, which has a leading role in the national strategy for the development of the creative economy, led by women and men dedicated to production.</p>

<p>18. Through our media, we highlight the efforts in agricultural and productive matters and the new model where small and medium producers are the main protagonists, accompanied by a series of capitalization programs, financing, technical and technological support and genetic insemination in the poultry, porcine and bovine sectors, in order to enhance our productivity, marketing and export capacities, all of which results in poverty reduction and policies that contribute to the improvement of yields that guarantee national food security.</p>

<p>19. The communication strategy in the tourism sector assists thousands of small and medium enterprises and campaigns position various destinations and natural beauties, encouraging Nicaraguan families to enjoy our country in peace, tranquility and security, achieving an extraordinary response from the National tourism.</p>

<p>20. From our media, we accompany the efforts of the government in matters related to community health, coming increasingly closer to the population, guaranteeing free and quality health and new infrastructure such as the construction of new hospitals, health centers, health posts, investment in state-of-the-art medical technology, health fairs and conferences such as the genuine program “My Hospital, My Community”, from a health model that favors the poorest.</p>

<p>21. Thanks to our health structure -organized by our Government- and the training of medical personnel, we have managed to bring the hospital to the neighborhoods, to the regions, thus developing another type of direct communication.</p>

<p>22. We must mention that the peoples of the world are subjected to a maelstrom of tensions, conflicts and wars instigated by the capitalist system. The Western powers, allied with the elites of each country, seek to impose capitalism with blood and fire, while our peoples and our media - each with its particular forms - fight against lies, fake news and the campaigns of the media corporations that try to make the diversity of thought invisible, uselessly aiming at silencing the people, with the aspiration of monopolizing public opinion. In this endeavor they have also failed, because our communicators have fought the battle from all spaces, and we have not allowed lies to prevail.</p>

<p>23. To continue fighting comrades, from this vital alliance, the ALBA-TCP, which enhances the capacities of our peoples. Today we are increasingly full of Vigor and Glory. The Victories of each one of us, is the victory of all. In each trench, we feel the strength of our Latin American and Caribbean ancestors, where little by little, we fight and win Battles, following the Ideals of Justice and Peace that ALBA defends.</p>

<p>24. We can say, without any hesitation, that ALBA has sons and daughters who love it, and this is firmly embodied in the role and work of communicators. All this strength must be accompanied by a permanent updating and revitalization of knowledge, which is why it is of great importance to continue with the training processes and the development of educational programs in the field of communication, which allows us to continue expanding the building of capacities and the dissemination of content between countries.</p>

<p>25. From the motherland of Sandino, we ratify the support for all the initiatives promoted by ALBA to strengthen our experiences, our social and cultural processes, with the technological and communicational aspects being one of the main pillars for the development of our peoples.</p>

<p>26. Once again, our fraternal embrace and our greetings to all the Women and Men of Communication in our Great Motherland and our fraternal and revolutionary recognition, because every day we build upon those victories that make us great, as Latin American and Caribbean Brothers and Sisters.</p>
