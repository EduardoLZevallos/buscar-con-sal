Recent events on the Nicaraguan political scene suggest the forces
which, for years now, have been trying to either successfully undermine
Arnoldo Alemán's leadership of the most important right wing party in
the country (the Constitutional Liberal Party, PLC,) or create an
equally important alternative party, are at present involved in a last
ditch attempt to achieve their goals.<br>
      <br>
Until last week, the Permanent Human Rights Commission (CPDH) - a
foreign government funded NGO that has historically worked to promote a
right wing agenda in Nicaragua - was committed to organizing interparty
primary elections for the right wing forces as part of the much built
up attempt to create one single opposition alliance going into next
year's presidential elections.<br>
      <br>
Among other parties both the PLC and Eduardo Montealegre's "Vamos con
Eduardo" Movement (MVE) had planned to take part in the elections. <br>
      <br>
On September 3rd, though, the CPDH announced its decision not to
continue organizing the primary election process. Going by CPDH
president Marcos Carmona' comments reported in the press, this decision
was based on the different parties' inability to maintain even the most
basic level of mutual trust.<br>
      <br>
The MVE seemed to welcome the decision saying that, under the
circumstances, it was more appropriate to choose a candidate via high
level interparty consensus. Alemán, on the other hand, continues
insisting on the need for primaries, saying he would only renounce his
candidacy if beaten at primary elections. <br>
      <br>
Even prior to the CPDH's announcement, though, the MVE was already
involved in a series of intense meetings with other anti Sandinista,
anti Alemán right wing forces including the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance
(ALN), the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), the Conservative
Party, a number of private sector organizations and several foreign
government funded NGOs, with a view to choosing a consensus candidate
for the proposed multi-sector, anti FSLN electoral coalition, an
electoral coalition Montealegre says should represent a "unified and
authentic" opposition.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pancho Madrigal for President</span><br>
      <br>
These meetings resulted in the decision to offer the presidential
candidacy, Fabio Gadea Mantilla, owner of the reactionary Radio
Corporación radio station who is currently a deputy for the PLC in the
Central American Parliament (PARLACEN) and who, until very recently,
had not been considered a dissident within PLC circles. <br>
      <br>
Fabio Gadea, a high level member of the PLC and creator of the long
standing and much loved "Pancho Madrigal" radio soap, accepted
Montealegre's invitation to stand as candidate for the newly founded
electoral alliance on September 7th. During his acceptance to run for
office, Gadea said he was willing to lead the new alliance "with or
without the PLC".&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Undeniably, though, the new political coalition Montealegre is trying
to set up would greatly benefit from the PLC's grass roots
organization. Past experience in Nicaragua has shown that electoral
alliances without a well established party organization have little
chance of defending whatever electoral success they may achieve. <br>
      <br>
Until a few weeks ago, Gadea's loyalty to Arnoldo Aleman's PLC had not
been questioned. Not only did Gadea vote for Alemán as the PLC
presidential candidate during the PLC convention in July, but he is
also the father-in-law of Alemán's daughter, María Dolores. <br>
      <br>
His personal and political ties to the PLC leader have led certain
political players, including PLC dissident Sergio Quintero García, to
suggest that Gadea's candidacy is nothing more than a ruse set up by
Alemán himself in which, at some point after Montealegre officially
renounced his own presidential candidacy (which he did on September
7th), Gadea is to step down hailing Alemán as the best man to lead the
opposition into next year's elections.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The question of whether or not Gadea is acting in ernest by accepting
Montealegre's offer aside though, it is far from clear if the radio
commentator and writer would stand a reasonable chance of encouraging
much support among the Nicaraguan population. <br>
      <br>
While it is true that Gadea's Pancho Madrigal program is no less than a
cultural institution in Nicaragua and has been for decades, Gadea
himself is not a particularly well known figure among Nicaragua's
predominantly young population. <br>
      <br>
At the age of 79, it would seem unlikely Gadea could muster much
enthusiasm among the more than 50% of Nicaraguan voters under the age
of 30 whose minds are still fresh with the memory of the national
debacle provoked by aging former president Enrique Bolaños who left
office in 2006 at the age of 78.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Smear campaign against Arnoldo Alemán </span><br>
      <br>
The other aspect of the strategy currently being put into practise by
Montealegre's "unified and authentic" opposition is a smear campaign
against Alemán which aims to force the former president to step down as
presidential candidate. <br>
      <br>
"Reelection is the cancer of the nation. Step down Dr Alemán," is the
slogan on banners that have appeared in towns and cities across
Nicaragua during recent weeks. <br>
      <br>
Simultaneously, Montealegre and others have been publicly voicing the
opinion that, should the right wing lose next year's elections, it
would be due to Alemán's refusal to step down as candidate and allow
the PLC to take part in the united opposition alliance Montealegre is
trying to set up. <br>
      <br>
Over the last few days, Montealegre has stepped up the psycological
pressure against Alemán saying he has information to suggest an
internal rebellion against the PLC leader is about to take place within
the party. <br>
      <br>
So far though, Alemán, who continues to insist on the need for
interparty primaries, has not given any signs of bowing to the pressure
imposed on him from other opposition sectors and is himself involved in
a smear campaign against Montealegre's faction which claims that it is
in fact the MVE that is provoking division among the right wing.<br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, the intense polarization between Alemán's followers and
Montealegre's followers as a result of recent events has put smaller
parties like the Conservative party and the ALN in s strong negotiating
position.<br>
      <br>
On September 8th representatives of the PLC and of the Conservative
Party agreed to continue with the organization of interparty primary
elections. It was also agreed that Fabio Gadea would be invited to take
part as the MVE candidate. <br>
      <br>
A key factor in the minds of all sectors of the right wing opposition
is the pending election of 25 top posts within different State
institutions including the Supreme Court of Justice and the Supreme
Electoral Council. This election represents a golden opportunity to
maintain, or to claim for the first time, influence in crucial places. <br>
      <br>
Candidates for these elections, which will take place in the National
Assembly, require a super majority of 56 votes to be approved for
office.<br>
      <br>
This 56 vote requirement makes it impossible for any combination of
opposition parties and independent deputies to vote in candidates
without negotiating with the FSLN, although it would be possible for
the PLC, the MVE or a combination of smaller parties and independents
to negotiate bilaterally with the FSLN.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This fact is one of the main reasons for heightened mistrust between
opposition factions at present. It is possible, for example, that
instead of forcing Alemán to step down, Montealegre's smear campaign
actually pushes Alemán into the FSLN's hands. Similarly, if Alemán
delays too long, the FSLN could negotiate bilaterally with the MVE or
with a combination of the other smaller factions in the National
Assembly.<br>
      <br>
Oscar René Vargas, Oscar Castillo and Félix Maradiaga, three political
analysts quoted in El Nuevo Diario on September 6th, all anticipate the
notorious so-called "pacto" between the PLC and the FSLN to be
relaunched before the end of the year. In other words, they predict a
bilateral agreement between Nicaragua's two largest parties vis-a-vis
the election of the above mentioned 25 top posts.<br>
      <br>
Undeniably, the division of the right wing is of tremedous benefit to
the FSLN, which over the past ten years has demonstrated its skill in
manipulating the bad feeling and mutual mistrust between right wing
factions in its favour. <br>
      <br>
To have a chance of securing a united alliance going into next year's
presidential elections, the opposition needs to either negotiate the
election of the 25 posts with the FSLN as one united bloc, or simply
hold out and not negotiate at all. <br>
      <br>
Given the inherent mistrust between the opposition's key players and
the sheer amount of institutional influence up for grabs, though,
neither of these two options will be particularly easy to achieve for
Nicaragua's splintered and disorientated right wing opposition.<br>
