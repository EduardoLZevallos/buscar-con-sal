<p><img alt="Policía Nacional esclarece asesinato atroz, terrorismo e incendio en Barrio Carlos Marx" height="275" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/articulos/230643.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="450" /><em><strong>This afternoon, Nicaragua’s national Police service gave details clarifying the case of terrorist arson in Managua’s Carlos Marx barrio that took place on June 16th this year in which six people died including two children.</strong></em></p>

<p>The details were given by Comissioner General Luis Perez Olivas, head of the office of Judicial Support who described the criminal offence as terrorism , arson and associated offences.</p>

<p>In the coup promoters’ terrrorist attack on the house in the Carlos Marx barrio, the people who died were Oscar Manuel Velásquez Pavón, 46 ; Maritza del Socorro López Muñoz, 46 ; Alfredo Manuel Velásquez López, 22; Mercedes de los Ángeles Raudez Álvarez, 20; Dayerys Osmari Velásquez Ráudez, 3 ; and Matías Eliseo Velásquez Ráudez, 4 months.<br />
<br />
The people who were wounded were Janeth del Socorro Velásquez López, 29; Francisco Javier Pavón, 30;  and Maribel de los Ángeles Velásquez López, 14.<br />
The police chief stated that these crimes were committed by terrorist delinquents who kept the local population under siege n particular the area in which the criminal attack took place.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Antecedents</strong></em><br />
<br />
Commissioner Perez Olivas said these events were the follow up to a threat issued on June 14th in the web site of the terrorist April 19th Movement against the Velasquez family simly because they refused to support the national strike convened by the coup promoters.</p>

<p>During his presentation, the head of the Office of Judicial Support showed the published order to make Sandinista sympathizers pay.</p>

<p>Subsequent to that order on Saturday June 16th at about ten past six that morning, groups of armed terrorists carrying metal tubes, hand held mortars, firearms and molotov fire bombs attacked the house causing a fire which in which the six people died and three people were wounded.</p>

<p>Immediately after this atrocious crime took place, Gonzalo Carrion, a representative of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (CENIDH) gave false information to right wing news media accusing the Nicaraguan police service so as to cover up the criminals really responsible.<br />
<br />
Comissioner Perez Olivas showed a video in which Gonzalo Carrión makes his remarks at the crime scene in which he misrepresents the events that took place in that eastern district of Managua<br />
<br />
The police chief stated, “Later, Vilma Núñez de Escorcia, the president of CENIDH, kept the survivors of the fire in hiding against their will and encouraged them to accuse the Nicaraguan government and the police, while promising them help to get visas to the United States and to Costa Rica even offering them to cover the costs of their visits to either of those two countries.”<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Accusations received by the National Police service</strong></em><br />
<br />
The police have carried out the following investigative process: reception of the criminal accusation; physical inspection of the crime scene; gathering of information from social media and investigation in the area of the attack.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the police have criminal forensic chemical, fire and explosives analysis with results positively inicating the use of gasoline by the coup-promoting terrorists to ignite the house as well as forensic medical examinations conducted on the two murdered children. They also have 20 witness declarations identifying the individuals who carried out the attack.</p>

<p><em><strong>A survivor’s testimony</strong></em><br />
<br />
The head of the Office of Judicial Support also played a video recording of Francisco Javier Pavón, a survivor of the criminal attack, who said that when he got out of the house the opposition activists operating the barricades arrived and “surrounded me and told me to give intervews to TV Channels 10 and 100% News”. This witness also said, “They told me to say it was the police and I had to say so because I was afraid, but the truth is that when I went out on the upstairs balcony there were no police there.”</p>

<p>In another video, the police present Roger Octavio Montenegro, a person responsible for receiving and distributing supplies at the occupied Polytechnic University (UPOLI) who stated that he knows the individuals who attacked the house in question.</p>

<p>On the roadblocks,  he got to know individuals called “Amilcar”, “Cara de Gato”, “Chibolón” and “El Firulay” who went on June 16th to the house that was attacked with molotov fire bombs, hand-held mortars unaware that another person, Oswaldo Manzanares, watched them as they burned down the house.<br />
<br />
Commissioner Perez Olivas also presented two of the criminal who participated in the events referred to namely, Karla Vanesa Mátus Méndez alias “La Flaca” and Amilcar  Antonio Cortés Báez alias “Condoro”.<br />
<br />
The chief of the Office of Judicial Support concluded saying that the fugitive criminals who also participated in the attack on the house are Rolando Leonel Flores Arévalo alias “Cara de Gato”, Oscar José Geovani Jaime, David Enrique Bellorín, also known as “Chibolón”, Shirley Mayerlis Pérez Castellón alias “La Colocha” and others whom the police believe are no longer in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The National Police service issued the following press release:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>PRESS RELEASE No. 124 – 2018</strong></em></p>

<p>The National Police informs the People of Nicaragua of the clarification of the crimes of Aggravated Murder, Terrorism and Arson committed by terrorist criminals at 6.10 a.m. on Saturday June 16th at a house of three floors in the Carlos Marx barrio located three and a half blocks west of the Colonia Miguel Gutierrez traffic lights in this city of Managua. These crimes caused grief and suffering to Nicaraguan families resulting in 6 people dying.</p>

<p>    1. Oscar Manuel Velásquez Pavón, 46 years old<br />
    2. Maritza del Socorro López Muñoz, 46 years old<br />
    3. Alfredo Manuel Velásquez López, 22 years old<br />
    4. Mercedes de los Ángeles Raudez Álvarez, 20 years old<br />
    5. Daryeli Osmary Velásquez Raudez, 3 years old<br />
    6. Matías Eliseo Velásquez Raudez, 4 months<br />
<br />
And three people wounded :<br />
<br />
    1. Janeth del Socorro Velásquez López, 29 years old<br />
    2. Francisco Javier Pavón, 30 years old<br />
    3. Maribel de los Ángeles Velásquez López, 14 years old<br />
<br />
These terrifying crimes were committed for revenge because the Velasquez family, owners of a mattress production business refused to support the proposed national strike. Two days before these crimes terrorist groups had published a “death sentence” against them.<br />
<br />
Immediately after these crimes, Gonzalo Carrion and other members of CENIDH gave false, baseless declarations to news media  accusing the Nicaraguan State and the National Police so as to cover up the real criminals.<br />
<br />
Likewise, Vilma Nuñez of CENIDH concealed the survivors against their will encouraging them to accuse the government of Nicaragua and the National Police with the promise of processing their United States or Costa Rican visa and offering to pay the costs of their stay in either country.<br />
<br />
Once the investigation process was carried out, it was proved that the authors of these horrific crimes were the terrorist criminals:<br />
<br />
-       Karla Vanessa Matus Méndez (alias La Flaca), Under arrest.<br />
-       Amílcar Antonio Cortez Báez (alias el Condoro), Under arrest<br />
-       Rolando Leonel Briones Arévalo (alias Cara de Gato), Fugitive<br />
-       Oscar José Giovanny Jaime, Fugitive<br />
-       David Enrique Vellorín y/o Vellorín Mayorga (alias Chibolón), Fugitive<br />
-       Shirley Mayerling Perez Castellón (alias La Colocha), Fugitive<br />
<br />
The National Police service managed to determine the criminal responsibility of these individuals based on the following evidence:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Accusations by relatives of the victims.</li>
	<li>Witness testimony of Francisco Javier Pavón, member of the Velásquez family and survivor of the arson attack who explains that when he managed to escape from the house he saw no police in the vicinity and that criminals from the roadblocks forced him  to talk to news media accusing the National Police service which he did out of fear that these criminals might kill him.</li>
	<li>Witness testimony of Róger Octavio Montenegro Doña who explains that he took part in the occupation of the UPOLI where he came to know Amilcar  and other individuals whom he knew only by their aliases “Chibolón”, “Firulais” y “Cara de Gato” and who he says all took part in the arson attack on the three floor house in the Carlos Marx barrio and for that reason he decided not to let them enter the UPOLI.</li>
	<li>    Physical inspection of the crime scene.</li>
	<li>    Information from social media and local investigation.</li>
	<li>    Criminal fire and chemical forensic analysis with positive results confirming the use of gasoline.</li>
	<li>    Results of medical legal examinations.</li>
	<li>    18 witness statements describing the criminals who committed the crimes.</li>
	<li>    Victim identification and witnesses who identify the people arrested as the authors of the crimes.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
The National Police service presented the crimnals to the competent authorities for trial and continues the search to arrest the fugitive criminals.<br />
<br />
Our Police Institution reiterates its commitment to guarantee the Peace, Security, Tranquility and Life of individuals, families and communities.<br />
