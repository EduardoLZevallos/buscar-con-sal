Pedro Haslam is the President of the Institute of Rural Development
(IDR) and member of the Board of Directors of the recently established
Nicaraguan Institute for
Promotion of the Cooperative Sector (INFOCOOP). He is also President of
the Nicaraguan Federation of Agro Industrial Cooperatives (FENIAGRO)
which is one of the biggest organizations of cooperatives in Nicaragua
representing over 27,000 small farming families. <br>
      <br>
In this interview Haslam talks about the highs and lows of the
historical process of the cooperative movement in Nicaragua dating back
to 1932 when Augusto C&eacute;sar Sandino founded the Central of
R&iacute;o Coco cooperative. To read the second part of this interview

      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Karla Jacobs: My first question
is about the cooperative sector. As we all know hundreds if not
thousands of cooperatives were formed in the Nicaraguan countryside
during the 80s
with support from the first FSLN government. It was a highly successful
social and productive experiment which became to be seen as a model in
Latin America.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">When Violeta Barrios won the
presidency, however, government support for the sector was
substantially reduced.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Perhaps
you can talk a bit about the experience of the cooperative sector
during the 16 years of neoliberal governments between 1990 and 2006.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
Pedro Haslam: One must refer to the country's history because it wasn't
just a coincidence that during the revolution led by the FSLN in the
1980s over 3,000 farming cooperatives were formed. And one must
remember that that social journey was only made possible as a result of
the
Sandinista land reform during which over 2,500,000 manzanas of land
were given to farmers organized in cooperatives. The Sandinista land
reform, I would say, was the most representative land reform project
in the world in terms of the percentage of the population benefited
and the percentage of the nation's land involved.<br>
      <br>
So during the 80s the cooperative sector enters the economy, and
despite the war of aggression, the cooperatives came to produce an
importante percentage not just of overall national food production but
also of agricultural exports. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neoliberalism obliged us to
redesign the cooperative model</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>During the years of
neoliberalism in Nicaragua it was really tough. We were confronted by a
full-blown offensive from the neoliberal system which started to
be installed in 1990 with Do&ntilde;a Violeta's government. This
offensive obliged us to rethink and redesign the organizational model
in the cooperative sector.<br>
      <br>
The cooperatives that survived, that resisted neoliberalism, had to
convert to an agro-exportation model producing coffee, sesame, dairy
products etc, because [simultaneous to the onslaught of neoliberalism]
the internal market contracted. The State abandoned all support for the
production of basic food for sale within Nicaragua. So it became
impossible to produce corn and beans for the internal market.<br>
      <br>
What the cooperatives that survived did was produce food for the
families involved with the cooperative, perhaps sell a little if there
was any left over, and then dedicate the rest of our time to the
production of exportable products. We couldn't carry on with the
organizational model as it was, [because the production of basic grains
and other basic foods for the internal market] had become effectively a
subsistence economy. <br>
      <br>
During those 16 years more than 50% of the land given to campesinos by
the FSLN in the 80s was taken away, sold or usurped. Different
mechanisms were used but the effect was the same - the land did not
remain under the ownership of the campesinos to whom it was given
during the land reform. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We dedicated ourselves to
resisting the offensive of the multinationals</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
So the government programs of technical assistance, transfer of
technology and seed production disappear. At the same time the national
bank and the other financial instruments aimed at supporting the rural
sector also disappear and the commercial banking sector is established.
Simultaneously, the political, juridical and administrative conditions
were created to encourage the installation of multinationals in
Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
So the group of cooperative organizations that were able to convert to
a more managerial model, developing technical and market administration
capacities, dedicated themselves to resisting the offensive of the
multinationals. <br>
      <br>
Today in the Nicaraguan coffee production sector, for example, there
are a number of cooperatives and then there are the multinationals
which operate via different mechanisms. Sometimes the multinationals
disguise themselves making their Nicaraguan representatives pass as the
owners of a national commercial business. This same situation occurs in
different sectors of the Nicaraguan economy. <br>
      <br>
The group of cooperatives that was able to re-establish itself within
the neoliberal model acted as the spearhead for the survival of the
cooperative sector. A number of cooperatives demobilized completely
during that period, while many others abandoned cooperative activity
but didn't disappear altogether. You could say they went into
hibernation. And that sector of cooperatives is the one which is
regaining dynamism today. <br>
      <br>
It is clear that the neoliberal model and the cooperative model are the
antithesis of each other. The cooperative model is a social model based
on solidarity which aims to create an economy beneficial to the
community in terms of production and services - you might call it a
socialist economy. The neoliberal model on the other hand, is an
individualistic model that concentrates wealth and excludes the
majority of the community. <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Statistics about the cooperative
sector </span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: You said at the beginning
of your answer that in the 1980s more that 3,000 cooperatives were
formed. Is there a statistic that tells us how many survived during
those 16 years?</span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
PH: In the 80s the majority of cooperatives that were formed were rural
cooperatives. Then in the 90s a number of cooperatives were formed
within the transport sector. Today the transport cooperatives represent
an important part of the cooperative sector.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The FSLN government composed a list of existing cooperatives [when it
came to power in 2007]. This list calculates just over 1,000
cooperatives including certain other expressions of integration like
unions, centrals and federation. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Are you talking about all
cooperatives or just agricultural cooperative there?</span><br>
      <br>
PH: All cooperatives. But the register we have shows us that roughly
70% of existing cooperatives are rural, agricultural cooperatives.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>And today, after nearly
three years of the Sandinista government there are just over 3,000
active cooperatives in Nicaragua thanks to the process promoted by the
government to form new cooperatives and reactivate hibernating
cooperatives. Luckily these cooperatives' documents and files&nbsp;
from the 80s and 90s still exist, there were not preserved as well as
they should have been, but at least they still exist.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sandino and his certainty that
the cooperative model provides solutions</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Tell me about the process
you mention that the FSLN government is promoting to reactivate and
incentivate the cooperative sector.<br>
      </span><br>
PH: Like I said before, one has to take Nicaraguan history into
account. We shouldn't forget that Sandino considered cooperative
organization to be "the appropriate social response to the country's
economy [in the quest] for the well-being of Nicaraguan families." <br>
      <br>
In 1934, when Sandino disarmed, or when the peace agreements were
signed because he never disarmed, he organized the first great
cooperative [in Nicaragua] called the Central of R&iacute;o Coco. <br>
      <br>
It is no coincidence that a month after Sandino was murdered Somoza's
guard attacked and disarticulated the R&iacute;o Coco cooperative. <br>
      <br>
In a declaration issued in the 1960s the Sandinista Front also
proclaims cooperative organization as a social model to be aspired to
by farmers and workers. <br>
      <br>
So it's not a coincidence that the FSLN government today acknowledges
the importance the cooperative sector has within a social economy. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The government has prioritized
the cooperative sector</span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
      </span> If you revise this government's National Plan of Human
Development, its National Production Plans, its social and economic
policies, you will find that the government consistently prioritizes
the cooperative sector. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
When President Daniel returned from the Conference of ALBA presidents
in Cochabamba last week as part of the report he presented to the
nation he called on the population to organize themselves in
cooperatives because, he said, it is a model that is very relevant to
the construction of a socialist model in Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
How precisely has the government promoted the cooperative sector? On
August 7th 2007, the cooperative movement accompanied by labour
organizations like the UNAG hosted a National Assembly of the
Cooperative Movement in S&eacute;baco. As part of the Assembly we
presented the movement's agenda to the Nation, to President Daniel and
to the Ministers. One of the points of the agenda urged the government
to proceed to institutionalize the cooperative sector. <br>
      <br>
On December 2nd of the same year Labour Minister Janet Ch&aacute;vez
swore in and installed the Board of Directors of INFOCOOP (Nicaraguan
Institute of Promotion of the Cooperative Sector) made up of four
ministers and five representatives of the cooperative sector. <br>
      <br>
From then we started to work to facilitate the sector's juridical and
administrative needs and to develop the process of institutionalization
of the sector. Now, two years later, we have seed production and other
production programs, programs that the government promotes and that are
carried out mainly through cooperative organizations. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>For example in the Rural
Credit Fund priority is given to cooperative organizations. So it is no
longer the conventional and non-conventional financial intermediary
organizations, as they are called, that administrate government funds,
but cooperatives. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">ALBA has created a great space
for cooperatives</span><br>
      <br>
As part of the ALBA-CARUNA program over 400 rural cooperatives are
assisted. In the last register we did we listed nearly 1,500
cooperatives assisted as part of government programs, and that doesn't
include the transport cooperatives through which the government subsidy
of public transport is channelled. <br>
      <br>
As a friend on the directorate board of ALBA in Nicaragua said, the
public transport tariff in Managua should be C$5. However, through the
cooperatives the government is subsidizing C$2.5. In other words half
of the real cost of the tariff is subsidized for over a million
Nicaraguans who use the service. <br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua there is great will and a comprehensive process in place
to ensure that all these programs are channelled through local
cooperative organizations. For example in the case of exports to ALBA
countries, the government has opened a great space for cooperative
organizations.<br>
      <br>
And now we have a new mechanism to help make these programs as relevant
to local demands as possible - the Departmental Production Councils.
These councils are made up of public institutions linked to production
plus local organizations that represent the producers in each
department.<br>
      <br>
Credit programs, ENABAS' [the State Basic Food Company] purchases,
purchases for ALBA programs, etc will all be channelled through these
Production Councils. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Commandant Daniel has always said that the cooperatives must progress,
that they must establish their own direct relationships in order to
benefit from the concept and the practice of fair trade which is the
other great element of this process. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The institutionalization of Fair
Trade</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Many of the cooperatives
in Nicaragua are involved in an international process called "fair
trade" which is based on solidarity between groups of consumers in
countries that consume our products and cooperatives in our countries.<br>
      <br>
And now that Nicaragua is a member of the Bolivarian Alternative for
the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) the practice of fair trade is no
longer an isolated event in Nicaragua. Today thanks to ALBA the concept
and practise of ALBA has been institutionalized. This means that there
are better opportunities for the producer with better prices and
simultaneously non speculative prices for consumers. Seen from a
strategic perspective, this is very important.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: I am interested in hearing
about the experience the FSLN has had during the promotion of this
process of support for and promotion of the cooperative sector and
specifically the formation of new cooperatives, because during the last
two decades an individualistic culture corresponding to the logic of
global capitalism has been imposed on Nicaragua. </span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Have you found that there are
sectors of society that are unenthusiastic about becoming involved with
a cooperative organization, or that resist a philosophy based on
concepts like solidarity and collectivism?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span><br>
      </span>PH: In general, at this time, we do not come up against
that sort of resistance. There were moments in the past when our
struggle was difficult in that sense, mainly in the late nineties as a
result of the media war [against the FSLN]. This media war is not just
an offensive against the FSLN and Commandant Daniel today, this
offensive has been a constant since the 80s. <br>
      <br>
During the neoliberal governments the media offensive acted as a base
which allowed the installation of that capitalism, that individualism,
that neoliberalism in our society. And I can't deny it, those years
were tough. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our traditional culture helps us
to maintain collective values</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>But there is a very
important aspect and that is that our traditional culture has always
been based on a great sense of community. I would say that that
culture, those traditional values held by the Nicaraguan people are the
greatest capital that the Sandinista Revolution has. And it is
something that neoliberalism was not able to destroy. <br>
      <br>
Nicaraguans naturally feel great solidarity with other people because
that is how our ancestors, our grandparents taught us to be. If you
visit the home of a Nicaraguan the least you will be offered is a cup
of coffee or a glass of water. Our culture is based on sharing the
little we have with others. It's not about sharing what is left over
because in an ordinary Nicaraguan home there aren't left overs. So our
culture has been a very important base for associativity. <br>
      <br>
There was a moment in which the attack we were subjected to by
neoliberalism, by the oligarchy and the media was debilitating. They
said that people who got involved in cooperatives were lazy, that they
didn't want to work, that they wanted hand outs. So we had to make a
great effort to be seen and perceived in a different way. And we have
been successful in that. Today the Nicaraguan population acknowledges
the importance of the cooperative sector's collaboration. <br>
      <br>
Just the fact that we didn't allow 100% of our land to be taken away
from us speaks volumes. The aggression against us was brutal. Many
farmers died. Nicaraguan farming families continued losing loved ones
as a result of the offensive of the counter-land reform process. <br>
      <br>
We just have to remember the coffee worker's struggle when hundreds of
people were obliged to take to the highway, for example. That was an
extremely difficult struggle. People died on the roads. And
representatives of the cooperatives accompanied the coffee workers in a
gesture of solidarity.<br>
      <br>
That type of situation is an important expression of the fact that in
Nicaragua there is an organizational culture. We organize ourselves for
many different things. In the majority of communities there is a water
committee, a women's committee, a youth group, a church committee, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
So our's is an organizational culture that has its origins in our
ancestors but that was stimulated and developed during the
revolutionary process of the 80s. And this culture, I repeat, is one of
the revolution's greatest capitals. <br>
