<p>“How furious they were when the North Korean President announced that they would not stand idly by in the face of aggression… he has been clear in saying: if they attack us, we will not hesitate to respond with the atomic weapons we have…and that makes them untouchable.</p>

<p>“What's the United Nations for? What's the United Nations for? Nothing! Because no matter how much they talk at the United Nations about reaching agreements, they're not fulfilled. Ah, if the agreement is to attack a country, that agreement is fulfilled.</p>

<p>“It's pointless for the vast majority of the world's people to vote there in favor of lifting the blockade against Cuba, because simply nothing happens there, and they actually intensify the blockade.</p>

<p>“It becomes increasingly clear that the United Nations has a number of organizations that serve nothing more than as instruments of empires, to squeeze the throats, the necks, of those peoples fighting for sovereignty, for well-being, for peace.</p>

<p>“Hope lies in these powers like the People's Republic of China, which has a humane, supportive, and generous attitude, and that logically makes it easier for it to be welcomed in all countries, and that angers the US government.”</p>

<p>Trump is now putting immigrants “in jail because he says they're all bandits, that they're all criminals, they're murderers. … But there's also a rebellion among immigrants who take to the streets to protest, and they're imprisoned and beaten. There in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the greatest resistance is there.”</p>

<p>“And here in Nicaragua, we continue to stand united, following the example of Carlos, who gave his life for the Nicaraguan people, for the peasants… And he gave his life fighting for unity…. this is a fundamental point for all of us Nicaraguans, for the youth, for the workers, for the Army, for the Police: unity! Because the enemy uses its skills to seek ways to sow distrust, sow division, speak ill of one another, thereby provoking fractures…The more united we are, the stronger we will be, the more we will guarantee peace for the Nicaraguan people. Peace for the Nicaraguan people means ensuring that we continue to advance all the social programs to defeat poverty and that the conditions of Nicaraguan families improve with each passing day.</p>

<p>That's actually the slaveholder mentality that endures in the United States, because let's remember that the United States is made up of European immigrants who were slaveholders and have maintained that worldview, that Ideology, and it is present in all these new policies that the President of the US is implementing against immigrants. We have faced this imperialist, selfish vision, these attempts at domination, practically since Nicaragua became a Republic.</p>

<p>Russian companies, Chinese companies, working in Nicaragua, exactly as it should be, but based on respect, without impositions. They have never demanded any kind of policy, they simply cooperate for the development of the Peoples, and that is what the imperialist mentality does not understand.</p>

<p>We see that clearly and with great hope, the strengthening of the BRICS, of the Eurasian Economic Union, we will be participating in the Eurasian Economic Union Forum, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and other Organizations that are emerging very strongly. And we, from CELAC, must maintain Latin American and Caribbean Unity. Every people has a different vision, different ideologies, different policies, but we should all be very clear we have a common enemy and that is poverty. That is what the Latin American and Caribbean Countries have in common, and we have to overcome it."</p>

The latest update on this solidarity organization’s aid to Nicaragua</p>

<p><a href="https://engage.squarespace-mail.com/r?m=686488ce08928c09db32fb05&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpopularresistance.org%2Fwashington-targets-social-achievements-of-cuba-nicaragua-and-venezuela%2F&amp;w=65633ccad7ab6b1e7304f87f&amp;c=b_68648871a8d3bd2e68e402e6&amp;e=2025-07-03T01%3A18%3A17.840865Z&amp;l=en-US&amp;s=CUEHDy6Zg9XLr9nfTPjqDuIZUA4%3D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Washington Targets Achievements Of Cuba, Nicaragua, And Venezuela</strong></a><strong> </strong>(John Perry, Roger Harris): Washington targets achievements of their health missions, like Mision Milago, which has treated over seven million patients in 33 countries since 2004. Washington has imposed sanctions on officials in countries using this and other Cuban medical missions. Supposedly aimed at stopping the “trafficking” of medical staff, the real intent is to destroy services that have proved immensely popular for their free, high-quality treatment, often in remote areas with few health facilities.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio labels Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua “enemies of humanity.” In reality, all three have made major advances in human development, albeit constrained (most heavily in Cuba’s case) by Washington’s attacks. All guarantee free education at all levels, including university. The three have also been international leaders in support of Palestine. Cuba was the first country in Latin America to sever diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973. Nicaragua did in 1982, reinstated by the neoliberal government in 1993, again severed in 2010 after the Sandinistas returned to power. Venezuela severed relations in 2009. </p>

<p>Sanctions on Venezuela have led to the deaths of over 100,000 Venezuelans by 2020. The blockade of Cuba, costing the country $13.8 million daily, is so destructive that nearly one in ten Cubans has left the country in the last three years. Nicaragua is losing $500 million in development funding annually because the US is blocking loans from the World Bank and other institutions.</p>

Service and industrial sectors were the main drivers. The Central Bank of Nicaragua reported that the country’s GDP grew by 3% in the first quarter of 2025, a figure lower than the previous year’s 3.5%. Exports grew by 8% so far this year, and foreign investment has risen to an equivalent of 14% of the GDP.</p>
