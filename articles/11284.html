<p><strong>WOMEN ARE LIFE !<br />
<br />
WE ARE JUSTICE AND DIGNITY !</strong></p>

<p>We are approaching March 8th, although every day is perfect for promoting the Rights and Dignity of Women more and more .</p>

<p>In our Nicaragua, with God's blessing, we have advanced in achieving Women's Rights, by means of Constitutional Norms of Equity that we have been able to make effective via the initiative of <strong>a State and a Government based on Social Justice, Solidarity, Fraternity and Recognition of the Dignity of All</strong>.</p>

<p>We have established, and fulfilled, the Constitutional fifty percent rule for all National and Local Elected Positions, as well as for Institutional Responsibilities at the State, Government and Municipal Level, and, thanks to the constant Promotion of Women's Rights, also in all the Social, Labor, Youth and Community Movements embodying Unity for the Common Good.</p>

<p>We cannot speak of Social Justice, or Human Rights, or of Respect for the Dignity of All, if we do not recognize and live out in practice the Rights of All, including and emphasizing the Rights of Women.</p>

<p>The task still pending, as we know, is cultural transformation. To move away from habits of patriarchal, machista domination, of customs that exclude and denigrate, towards a Culture of Everyday Life, of Equity, Dignity, Respect, for the Good, Valued Life, among All, with All, and for the Good of All.</p>

<p><strong>What we lack</strong><br />
<br />
In this sense, we want to acknowledge what we lack and commit ourselves to work together, so that we lack progressively less. With Love and Justice, rejecting, combating and advancing against mistreatment, abuse, irresponsibility, sexual offenses and wrongs, atrocious and hateful crimes and outrageous  assaults committed against Women around the World and in our Nicaragua.</p>

<p>On March 8th, we celebrate our Struggle, our Battle, for a reality that includes all of us in the Meaning, Advocacy and Practice of Human Rights. And these must also comprise, because they too exist, the Right to Women's Physical, Psychological, Mental and Cultural Dignity, along with Respect for our Talents, Capabilities and Authority, in all the <strong>Spaces of Light, Life and Truth.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Justice, Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>On March 8th, as we salute and celebrate our Courage, we commit ourselves to working even more for Justice in family responsibilities and to achieve in practice the indispensable support, based on solidarity, between Mothers and Fathers so as to avoid and prevent the abandonment of paternal and family obligations.</p>

<p>We also recognize our traditional Strengths of Culture and Family Values, where we unite and support each other out of Solidarity, to face Life.</p>

<p>As Women, who are Mothers, Grandmothers, Daughters, Sisters, Aunts, Granddaughters, that is to say, Human Family, vibrant, vital Human Beings, we see ourselves as we really are, full of Strength, Faith, and Potential that must be taken into account and incorporated with deep Admiration, with Affection, in daily Life, in all its aspects.</p>

<p><strong>Complementary Protagonists</strong></p>

<p>As courageous, eloquent, powerful Women, it is up to us to work raising our Voices, uniting our Voices, clamoring and acting, realizing our true greatness, deserving of respect, strong in support of Life, as we should be, recognized and admired by our Partners, by our Families, and by all People of Good Will.</p>

<p>We recognize this still pending Task, and we assume our responsibility, our Luminous and Victorious Duty, to advance in the Sacred Mission of achieving Concord, Respect, Well-being, Harmony at Home and in the Community, and to find that essential Sisterhood and Brotherhood at all Times, in all Circumstances and Spaces of what Life Truly is.</p>

<p>This March 8th we are going to acknowledge ourselves as formidable and heroic Women, in our Work, in the Professions, in our worthy Vocations, in Study, Culture, Sport.... We recognize our Merits, our vitality and significant contributions, in Health, Education, Production, Business, Trade; Institutionalizing Justice, highlighting the efforts along Paths of Respect and Dignity, which belong to all of us too, promoting ourselves, respecting and transcending ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>Terrorism against Women</strong></p>

<p>The criminal Terrorism of the failed coup attempt impacted all of us, but especially Women. The voices of that criminal Terrorism, no longer loud thank God, still distress, afflict and offend the many thousands of Heads of Family who with our Partners, Children, Grandchildren, our Elderly and Family Members with disabilities, were exposed, all of us, to a genocidal kind of unexpected, unjust assault against a People of God, who have always cultivated Generosity and Solidarity.</p>

<p>We women have been brave and have transcended all this abominable darkness. With our Faith and our powerful Hearts, we have overcome the darkness, and brought Light much closer, in an unmistakable reality. Because it is a lived reality, one that we feel, and because we recognize it, precisely because we are accomplished Advocates of those</p>

<p><strong>Courageous and Enlightened, Genuine Truths.</strong></p>

<p>We affirm based on our Human Value, the Unity in Rights, in Trust, Joy, Respect and Recognition of the hard working and peaceful Life, based on that Better World that we have been striving to create, Conscious of the Spiritual Power, the Power for Good, the transforming Power of Love.</p>

<p><strong>Capable of So Much! Overcoming So Much!</strong></p>

<p>In every part, in every space, in every Territory of our Free and Faithful Nicaragua of Sisterhood and Brotherhood and Solidarity, we pay homage and honor the Woman Human Being , who is capable of so much, and who has overcome so much.</p>

<p>Because we have been able to transcend, to progress, to triumph over the lack of love. Over infamy. Over the unworthy collapse of those who do not love. Over malevolent manipulation. Over falsity. Over repeated attempts to alter our Traditional Culture, our Traditional Cultural Values, and install Models from other latitudes, denying us the Right to our Culture, our Identity, our Love of Life, and our own Models of Family and of Hope.</p>

<p>Women are more than half of the World, and we are well aware of our Intelligence, of our Supreme Gifts. And we know that with our Woman's Heart and Soul, with our condition as Transcendent Beings, who have advanced, despite insults, humiliation and being made invisible through so very many Times, we can distinguish shadow from light, choosing clarity always.</p>

<p>With Wisdom, Serenity, Sensitivity and essential Virtues; never ignoring our Spirituality among ourselves; through both intuition and reason, in our own Right we are a Voice contributing to calm, to understanding, to the permanent validity of Values, ones we do not seek to substitute, nor betray out of self-interest into the hands of outsiders, Values that distinguish us and defend us, making us a Force of Patience and Prudence, Serenity and Lucidity, a Force of Victories, of Peace, of Life and Goodness, all that we are, that all of us owe to each other.</p>
