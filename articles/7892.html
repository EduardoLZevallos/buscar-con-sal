GREATER CARIBBEAN FOR PEACE</strong></p>

<p>We, parliamentarians from the nations of Cuba, Nicaragua, Colombia, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras and Uruguay, belonging to the Caribbean basin, gathered in the city of Caracas, Venezuela, for the purpose of defending peace, respect for sovereignty and international law in our Region, in the face of the growing threats and aggression by the government of the United States of America, under the pretext of a "war on drug trafficking", state the following:</p>

<p>Considering</p>

<p>That the peoples of the Greater Caribbean, united by the sea and heirs of anti-colonial struggles, as well as of a deep tradition of solidarity and cooperation between sister nations, have forged their regional identity on the values of independence, justice and mutual respect, making peace a way of life and a historical commitment to the dignity, development and freedom of all the peoples of the region.</p>

<p>That the Charter of the United Nations establishes as its purpose “To maintain international peace and security” and; adopts as principles “the sovereign equality of all its Members”; so that neither international peace and security nor justice are endangered” and; that its members "shall refrain from resorting to the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State”.</p>

<p>That the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco), signed by 33 States of our region in 1967, establishes “to prohibit and prevent” in their respective territories “any form of possession of any nuclear weapon, directly or indirectly, by mandate of third parties or in any other way.”</p>

<p>That on January 29, 2014, at the Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) held in Havana, Cuba, 33 countries of the region declared “Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace based on respect for the principles and norms of international law”; with the “permanent commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes in order to banish forever the threat and use of force in our region,” in recognition of “peace as a supreme good and legitimate desire of all peoples.”</p>

<p>That on August 20th, the XIII ALBA Summit of Heads of State and Government categorically rejected “the orders of the United States government to deploy military forces based on pretexts, with the clear intention of illegal and interventionist impositions, contrary to the constitutional order of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean policies.”</p>

<p>That since the month of August of this year, the government of the United States has undertaken a military deployment in our region, which, according to various sources include 10,000 soldiers, AC-130 transport and logistics combat aircraft, a USS Wichita combat ship, 6 MQ9 Reaper drones, 3 B-52 bomber surveillance aircraft, 10 F-35 stealth fighters, 2 resupply ships, three guided missile destroyers, 1 nuclear submarine, three amphibious groups of the Iwo Jima battle group, a hitherto undetermined number of Black Hawk helicopters and recently the mobilization of the aircraft carrier USS "Gerald R. Ford".</p>

<p>That using this deployment of weapons, extrajudicial executions have been committed since last September 2nd, whereby at least 61 people of various nationalities from the region have been killed, in 15 attacks on boats; clearly illegal and criminal actions threatening the sovereignty of our nations and seeking to interfere through the use of force in the internal affairs of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean, with the ultimate aim of exploiting and appropriating the natural and energy resources existing in the territories of our nations.</p>

<p>That the Caribbean nations, throughout their historical relations, have held in common themes based on solidarity, as has been demonstrated in recent years with joint policies for the well-being of our peoples, Cuban medical missions to different countries in the region, the Caracas Energy Agreement, Petrocaribe, among other initiatives that have made it possible to promote brother and sisterhood, harmony, peace and respect for the sovereignty of our nations.</p>

<p>We declare</p>

<p>1. That we strongly reject the acts of aggression, threats and promotion of violence by the United States government in the Greater Caribbean, executed under the pretext of the “war on drug trafficking”, with the aim of interfering in the internal affairs of our countries and promoting regime change submitted to and aligned with their interests, through obsolete colonial practices.</p>

<p>2. To reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular:<br />
* The maintenance of international peace and security.<br />
* The principle of the sovereign equality of all its members.<br />
* The obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.</p>

<p>3. To exercise our Right to Peace as an inalienable foundation for the sustainable development and well-being of the peoples of the Caribbean.</p>

<p>4. To defend in an unrestricted way the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, condemning any attempt at external interference, political coercion or unilateral measures.</p>

<p>5. To ratify our commitment to non-aggression, rejecting the use of force. Recognize the right of Venezuela to exercise its legitimate right to defense, according to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, through all efforts to preserve peace and civic, military, police mobilization.<br />
<br />
6. To promote dialogue and cooperation by strengthening regional mechanisms such as CELAC, ALBA-TCP and CARICOM, to promote solidarity and peace.</p>

<p>7. To condemn the extrajudicial executions carried out by the United States Armed Forces in the Caribbean Sea, acts which violate human rights and our States exercise of sovereignty.<br />
<br />
8.To demand from the government of the United States and the Congress of that country the immediate cessation of all actions that violate the rights of the sovereign States of the Caribbean, the withdrawal of its military fleet deployed in the region, and the adoption of a responsible approach in the treatment of drug trafficking.<br />
<br />
9. To invite national, regional and international parliaments to join this commitment, promoting joint initiatives in defense of peace and sovereignty, and articulating efforts in multilateral forums to reaffirm Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace.<br />
<br />
10. Our willingness to promote joint actions aimed at strengthening parliamentary diplomacy for peace, including spaces for consultation, exchange and cooperation which contribute to the creation of permanent regional articulation mechanisms and the global dissemination of common messages in defense of the sovereignty, integration and peace of the Greater Caribbean.<br />
<br />
11. To ratify the full validity of the Proclamation of Latin America as a Zone of Peace, the scope of which is particularly ratified in these conditions, for the Greater Caribbean.</p>

<p>12. To defend peace, to reject imperial wars, aggression and provocations, with positions of unity in diversity to protect the most precious asset of our peoples, which is the life of every person, no matter their political affiliation or religion respecting plurality of thought.<br />
<br />
13. To promote urgently and by all ways and means possible, the activation of awareness of the danger that affects the region.<br />
<br />
14. To promote a cultural movement including of artists, spokespersons from art and culture, as well as intellectuals who promote Peace and the sovereignty of Peoples.<br />
<br />
The present Parliamentary Declaration of the Greater Caribbean for Peace is to be sent to the Secretary General of the United Nations, to the Pro Tempore Presidency of CELAC, to the CARICOM Secretariat, to the Latin American and Caribbean Parliament (PARLATINO), to the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN), and to the national parliaments of the region, for their knowledge, support and dissemination.<br />
Given in Caracas, on the 31st day of October 2025.</p>
