after the Official Event Promoting Senior Commanders<br />
of the Nicaraguan Army to the Military Rank of Colonel General</strong></p>

<p><strong>June 2nd 2025</strong></p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="356" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/425042.jpeg" width="442" /></p>

<p>Good evening, Compañeras and Comapñeros. A Historic Day, and a day to grow more, a day to learn more and more; as the Anthem of our Army says, we are building and defending the Patriotic Nation of which we dream.<br />
<br />
All this restructuring being carried out contributes to that daily, permanent defense of Peace, which is the Essential Heritage of Nicaragua’s People, of all of us. Proud, happy, and we know that our People, Nicaragua’s Families, also recognize the work, every day and at all times, by our Authorities of the Nicaraguan Army, the National Police, the Ministry of the Interior, being All Together in defense of Peace, which is both the Way and the Destination. Because there is no Progress without Peace.</p>

<p>And as our Comandante Daniel also said, in Central America, thank God, we have Peoples who live in Peace, since Peace is the basis for transcending the Poverty that has been imposed on us, and the unity of Central America’s Families is also key to being able to better articulate our efforts, to integrate, as it should be, to strive together for Peace.</p>

<p>We have always said that the Central American Integration System, as well as all these Organizations that are those of our Peoples, not ones that have been imposed, should serve to strengthen Peace and advance against Poverty, that cardinal sin.</p>

<p>Because selfishness, which generates Poverty and which deprives human beings of their own lands, of their own goods, of their own riches, that selfishness is a cardinal sin, a sacrilege. And for us, as Christians, to advance against Poverty is to advance against the deadly sins, against selfishness, and above all to promote that sense, that reality of Life in Brother and Sisterhood, in Solidarity, in Fraternity, as a Christian People, as the People of God.</p>

<p>We are happy, we are proud, and we know that we have to work hard every day to make our Dreams come true, what we aspire to, what we need, what is essential: To advance in Education, in Health, in Infrastructure, Highways, Streets, Parks, Markets, Housing... Everything that we have to give to Nicaraguan families each day, multiplying it all.</p>

<p>And as our Comandante Daniel said, we have also to strengthen that permanent vigilance over those systems of Health, Education, and other systems for the Common Good and we do have a weakness as regards the number of accidents. There were a lot of accidents this weekend, especially of buses. And really, every time there is an accident of public transport, dozens of people go to hospital, are injured, wounded, some are even affected practically for life.<br />
<br />
The Plan that our officials are going to present to Comandante Daniel, that they are going to present to us both, must be a Plan taking into account grief, suffering, loss... When I say loss, it is that that Families suffer not only when a Loved One gets injured, but there are others who lose their lives and it is this loss that is suffered; and at the end of the day we have to stop this plague.</p>

<p>Some people say that because the roads are so good, people speed. I think it has to do not only with the roads, because there is a lot of neglect too, we drive using our mobile phone; sometimes we ignore not drinking alcohol before driving; sometimes we also drive vehicles that are in poor condition and we don't have them checked, or public transport vehicles are not checked, above all we have to regulate, even more firmly, more rigorously, to avoid the grief that affects Families so much everywhere.</p>

<p>This is a week with a great number of Heroic Commemorations, today was the remembrance of 56 Comrades whose Lives we celebrated there in La Rampla, in Siuna. We celebrate those Lives that inspire us all, because so many Young People, so much Youth that was massacred have become Sacred Blood for us, nourishing our Spirits and above all inspiring to be better every day so as to better defend the Peace that guarantees us everything we deserve to have as a People.</p>

<p>Above all, to leave behind Poverty behind, in every sense: Material Poverty, Poverty, unfortunately, Spiritual Poverty abounds, which can even lead some People to attack their own Countries, their own Peoples, their own Sacred Lands. We already know the purpose of these people, so we really to strengthen the Spiritual Struggle too, which allows us to recognize ourselves as Neighbors, to love each other as Neighbors, and to share; to live together sharing, which is the basis, the key also to Living as Christians, as a Christian Family.</p>

<p>A warm embrace to everyone.</p>

<p>Today also Chinandega celebrated the lives of the Compañeros and Compañeras of El Calvario; in Ticuantepe too there are Celebrations this Week. And we say Celebrations, because by honoring our Heroes we celebrate their Life and we are sure that they are here with us, and to their relatives we say: We will never forget what they represent for this Nicaragua that we have today, where we can advance, make our way, flourish, making our Dreams flourish and leaving behind those terrible times that we lived through and which they wanted to repeat in 2018, but They Could Not Prevail, Nor will They!<br />
<br />
And I also join with what our Comandante Daniel was saying in his denunciation of the inhuman treatment received by our Sisters and Brothers from Latin America and the Caribbean, in the US, as well as our Nicaraguan Sisters and Brothers.</p>

<p>I think it was Saturday, I can't remember if it was Friday or Saturday, how I suffered watching the images of the mothers and heartbreaking cries of little boys and girls next to each other, scared, terrified. Even people who left a long time ago and who are suddenly torn away from the place where they are living peacefully, because we are not talking about criminals, we are talking about honest, hardworking, conbative people, who have left over the years. To all of them our Affection, our Solidarity.</p>

<p>We let them know, in the case of Nicaraguans, that here they have their Country, their Land, their Family, their Culture, their Tradition, all that Nicaraguans miss so much when they move to other places. And we are all here to keep pushing forward in the fight against poverty.</p>

<p>Warm embraces, Compañeras and Compañeros. Let us Go Onward, Always Further On, towards the Forever 19th, 46/19, only a few weeks are left. We are going to march starting from the middle of this Month until July 19th every Weekend, celebrating the lives of all those who left us the duty to be responsible to our ideals, to our sense of Dignity and National Pride. The duty also to bring about the Nicaragua that we all want, that we all dream of, of Well-being, of more Serenity, more Security, more Stability and, above all, of Prosperity.</p>

<p>Warm embraces, Compañeras and Compañeros. Thank you.</p>
