<p><strong>Who is left over in Nicaragua?  Who is left over in the US?  Who is left over in the world?</strong></p>

<p><em>“I went to the rich man's house,<br />
 and I took away what he had stolen from me,<br />
 I recovered my humanity,<br />
 my dignity.<br />
 I went to Wall Street and got back what was stolen from me.<br />
 I'm not going to let the system run me over”</em></p>

<p><em>(Chant of demonstrators in April protesting against poverty in front of the New York Stock Exchange.)</em><br />
 <br />
When I saw him dressed in religious clothing on his knees with his arms outstretched, looking half-smiling at the camera, I thought I saw a character from Buñuel's films. What was I going to call you, Rolando Álvarez, or was I going to give you another name on my own? It's not that you're a good actor, it's that I didn't believe you were a bishop or a person earning his bread working as an actor, I don't know, You seemed like a guy who didn't fit that expression.<br />
 <br />
When I saw that you were a bishop, I remembered Father Miguel D'Escoto, and I did see him as a pastor responsible for priests. Then I asked myself, how is it that a dark-haired man defends those who have exterminated his own? I also told myself: well, there are slaves, there are workers who defend their exploiters, and there are priests who hate the workers. So, who does the actor Rolando admire?<br />
 <br />
In the country where the working class has its organs of power with which it alleviates its working life, you manifest desires for disturbance, speaking from the pulpit to the congregation that fights to prevent the prosperity of those who have sacrificed their physical and intellectual effort to protagonize in history once and for all. Do you know why they have fought to achieve it? Because they do not want to continue being slaves of the little gentleman, nor of the oligarchy allied with the clergy, nor of the empire.<br />
 <br />
I see him with the skullcap, the purple cap on the crown, his pastoral cross, and you know, it all seems fake to me. You who are chief priests, you who have been entrusted with authority, you with the cassock of buttons and violet trim, … you are not the one who says, you do not honor Mr. Miguel D'Escoto, you have locked yourself up against the rules of the vast majority, which must be declared in good coexistence. In Nicaragua no one is left over, only you know if you want to exclude yourself. Could it be that you long for those days? Could it be that you want the tragedy to return and you see yourself directing the fire?<br />
 <br />
His frustration is that they haven't even touched him, Sandinista humanity is like that, they've sent him home, and that's why I've seen him on his knees, with his arms outstretched and I don't know if he's smiling, he seems to beg that, please, give him a scratch, a bruise, and if no Sandinista wants to do it, at least someone should give him even a pinch. No, priest, reflect if you are able, and recover as a human being, which is not the same as having your arms outstretched and kneeling.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Who is left over in Nicaragua?</strong><br />
<br />
You who are a follower of your superiors who fled to the US to fuck the legs of "Narco" Rubio's pants (I'm sure you know why they call him Narco). Know that, except for Anglo-Saxon whites, African-Americans and Latinos are the vast majority of prisoners in the US, and therefore you would be a candidate to enter those centers of terror, but you are lucky to be in Nicaragua, and more specifically in your home.<br />
 <br />
The good Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of Nicaragua, made up of 50% women and 50% men at all levels, does not attack anyone, does not rob anyone, does not block anyone, and in the face of the present crisis generated or created by the US, there is a derivative that should be known, the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua has a social system that protects the people and also gives its supportive help to a friendly and respectful country, that has needed it, just like Cuba.<br />
 <br />
While the government of imperialism, of capitalism, of "liberalism", does business of its people and with the other peoples of the world, it wages war to the point of endangering the very existence of humanity; it robs and destroys all those it assaults and it blocks and suffocates, those it cannot. The so-called "richest country in the world" by the post-truth press is not the richest; it must be said that it is the one with the richest in the world, 1% of its population and their government, because the government is theirs, you have hardly any social assistance to the American people. Who would you say is left over in the US?<br />
 <br />
You should also know that most of the prisons in the US are managed by capitalist companies, "liberal" companies, and that the widespread corruption in that rotten state apparatus has stimulators of the prison business in the judiciary, the latest news on the matter is that some judges, charged for sentencing children to jail has come to light, figures in the millions, the US regime is like that. You wouldn't be at home attacking rich Americans from your pulpit. Do you know the story of Martin Luther King? He was assassinated for defending the poor and Afro-American population. How far are you from Father Miguel D´Escoto ?<br />
 <br />
I am going to tell you something about the United States, that country where its coup leaders went to hide, and some things in which its billionaires are involved, then you tell me who is left over in the world.<br />
 <br />
In the US there are 17 million children suffering from hunger and extreme poverty, to make matters worse those poor children<a href="https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2022/08/17/escandalo-en-eeuu-jueces-sobornados-para-enviar-ninos-a-prision"> are the candidates to be locked up in prison</a>,</p>

<p>Capitalism has been entering a progressive crisis and threatens to explode, its paralysis, its decline, its retreat has generated such international tension that it even threatens the continuity of life on earth. Capitalism shows signs of being exhausted, it does not produce by itself and its debt does not find anyone to pay it in order for it to continue as the dominant system. As a result of their failure, the big capitalists do the math and intend to eliminate everything that seems surplus to them, in order to continue dominating, if you are not profitable, if you do not leave surplus value, you yield to their income statement, there is no need for you to live; you enter into the disposal plan.<br />
 <br />
In 2012, twelve million children in the US went hungry, now there are 17 million, and how many are there on that list in Spain? There were already 30%, and now? The multimillionaires have a way of eliminating the surplus people who serve them as a business, I tell you, Mr. Priest.</p>

<p><strong>In Nicaragua no one is left over</strong><br />
<br />
There are plenty of hungry American children, plenty of hungry Spanish children, children and the elderly of the territories that the US governs and their own working class, that is not productive... we are leftovers.</p>

<p>But, don't get down on your knees again and with your arms outstretched in the middle of the street, don't make a fool of yourself anymore and say: who's left over, Bishop Rolando Álvarez? Think about it now that you have time to think about it in your house, he is lucky to be in Nicaragua, they have not put him in jail, although he has encouraged the continuation of the coup.<br />
 <br />
Remember the beginning of this note, after reading it, whoever is left can say:<br />
<br />
“I went to the rich man's house, / and I snatched what he had stolen from me, / I recovered my humanity, / my dignity. / I went to Wall Street and got back what was stolen from me. / I'm not going to let the system run me over”, * chanted the demonstrators in April, protesting against poverty in front of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
