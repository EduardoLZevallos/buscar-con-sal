July 19th this year was the 31st anniversary of the Sandinista
Revolution in Nicaragua. It also marked three and a half years of
steady and important economic, social and cultural advances as well as
improvements in civil and political rights under the FSLN government of
President Daniel Ortega. (1) But this broad and deep change for the
better in Nicaragua has been erased from international media coverage. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua a target in the regional crisis<br>
      <br>
Across the political spectrum, in tune with false US State Department
propaganda, reporting on Nicaragua is almost uniformly hostile to the
country's Sandinista government. Opinions that contradict the anti-FSLN
consensus get suppressed. Now, almost exactly a year after the military
coup in Honduras, Costa Rica's legislature has authorized the presence
in that country of 10,000 US marines and the use of Costa Rican ports
by over 40 US Navy vessels including vessels designed for launching
amphibious assault operations.<br>
      <br>
At the same time, Colombia's government has begun to assign maritime
oil and gas exploration rights in sea areas currently disputed under
international legal proceedings brought&nbsp; by Nicaragua. All that
broad context of military and diplomatic menace is very similar to what
the United States has orchestrated against the government of President
Hugo Chávez&nbsp; in Venezuela. But whereas US moves against Cuba,
Bolivia and Venezuela get at least some coverage in the corporate and
alternative media, the military encirclement of Nicaragua has barely
been reported.<br>
      <br>
It is as though Nicaragua has disappeared except when served up as
unrecognizable media fodder to stuff the propaganda consensus of the US
State Department and a broad range of media against progressive
governments in Latin America. Those governments - Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador and Venezuela - have broken the dead hand
choke-hold of US and European political and economic domination. That
is why President Obama is setting a provocative foreign policy scene in
Central America and the Caribbean, just as he and his foreign policy
team have done in the Persian Gulf, along the borders of Russia and in
Korea.<br>
      <br>
Power and complicity<br>
      <br>
In proportion to the decline of their economic power, the United
States' elites and their European and Pacific allies are deploying
their countries' military power ever more aggressively to maintain
their global dominance. To carry out that deployment they need to
deceive and brainwash their countries' peoples &#8211; as they did over Iraq
and Afghanistan - into accepting the massive criminality such military
aggression involves. For President Obama and his duplicitous militarist
accomplices, a satisfactory alternative to outright approval of their
criminality is dumb complicity. <br>
      <br>
President Obama's spectacular capacity for double-speak and
double-think perpetuates the long&nbsp; intellectual and moral
subjection of US governments to elite interests. They habitually dress
it up as the-best-that-can-be-done. President Obama's handling of the
Honduran coup was a fine demonstration of his and Hillary Clinton's
double-dealing, disingenuous PR skills. Their plausibility derives
intellectually from US pragmatism, just as the glossy credibility
of&nbsp; Tony Blair's neoliberal New Labour makeover derived largely
from European post-modernist mind ballet and word play. <br>
      <br>
Blair and Obama front for corrupt political, military, industrial,
commercial and financial elites that take double standards for granted.
They proclaim a war on terror when they themselves promote terror
ruthlessly around the world. Of that, US and European promotion
of&nbsp; terrorism against Iran&nbsp; and the US government's
protection of CIA super-terrorist Luis Posada Carriles are only the
most obvious examples.<br>
      <br>
They let the global majority starve and die of preventable diseases to
save a few tens of billions of dollars, but supply trillions of dollars
to rescue corrupt, failed banks and financial conglomerates. They
declare a &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;, but protect corrupt narcotics-linked
governments, like those in Afghanistan or Colombia, and permit US banks
to launder the proceeds. The recent case against US banks laundering
money from narcotics (2) made clearer than ever that international
financial markets depend significantly for their liquidity on
laundering money from drugs and
other lucrative criminal activities. <br>
      <br>
In a recent judgment, Goldman Sachs was fined over US$500 million for
fraudulently misrepresenting a security it sold to unwary investors. It
was merely the latest case in a long history of similar cases revealing
Wall Street criminality. The chronic US and European securities and
debt valuation crisis, turning the Federal Reserve's and the European
Central Bank's balance sheets into fairy tales out of the Brothers
Grimm, mirrors corporate market capitalism's moral and intellectual
crisis.<br>
      <br>
Liberal scepticism as alibi<br>
      <br>
Peerless phoneys like Barack Obama and Tony Blair spin their wrongdoing
based on the hubristic arrogance that their societies represent the
pinnacle of human development. Their concept of the West's civilizing
mission used to justify their crimes against the world's peoples
differs
little from the excuses used by genocidal colonialist forebears like
Theodore Roosevelt or
Lord Curzon. Grafted onto their atavistic colonialist mentality is the
post-modernist pragmatic ideological argot that reality is what you
make it - damn any US founding fathers' &#8220;decent respect for the
opinions of mankind&#8221;. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
Similarly convinced that contemporary United States society represents
the best humanity has managed to achieve, the very influential writer
Richard Rorty advocated most elegantly and eloquently the merits of the
pragmatic and post-modernist intellectual traditions. His approach to
various questions comes across cogently in a video discussion with the
analytical philosopher Donald Davidson. (2)&nbsp; During their
exchange, Rorty casually remarks that when in Europe he tends to defend
US pragmatism, while, in the US, he tends to defend&nbsp; European
post-modernism.<br>
      <br>
If one goes looking for where black-face-white-mask President Barack
Obama's shape-shiftiness comes from, the kind of thinking advocated by
eminent intellectuals like Richard Rorty may not be a bad place to
start. Raffish scepticism and the high value placed on ironic
redescription make fine intellectual getaway vehicles. The effort to
evade moral relativism by an appeal to solidarity and the eschewal of
cruelty comes as an unconvincing, unenforceable afterthought. <br>
      <br>
In any case, the proliferation of varieties of solidarity and cruelty
drive the discussion down into the footnotes of&nbsp; liberal
humanism's disintegration as an alibi for the hypocrisy and sadism of
its practical imperialist expression. An ironic correspondence exists
between Hegel's admiration for Prussia&nbsp; and Rorty's loyal
admiration for the United States. Ever since the epoch of slavery and
genocide, the United States and Canada, and their European and Pacific
allies have always depended on their military and economic power to get
what they need to guarantee their privileged existence from weaker,
resource-rich peoples and countries.<br>
      <br>
Setting up Nicaragua, again<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's history of resistance to that kind of foreign domination
and interference continues to this day and explains why it is a target
of US government displeasure. The country's next presidential elections
are scheduled for November 2011. Currently all the opinion polls assume
that the FSLN will run Daniel Ortega for re-election and that he will
beat even a united opposition, heavily supported as they are by
President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even right-wing opposition polls
show Daniel Ortega winning by a modest margin, the sandinista
polls by a larger one. <br>
      <br>
Given that, the US-supported opposition have just two ways to defeat
the FSLN in those presidential elections. One option &#8211; the current one
- is to try dragging the country into institutional chaos, making the
elections impossible. The other option is to create a polarizing
climate of&nbsp; fear that a vote for the FSLN will risk war. Both
options are well served by the militarization of the region achieved by
the army-backed coup in Honduras and the US deployment of marines and
warships in Costa Rica.<br>
      <br>
The prequel to whatever scenario is being set up by the State
Department and its local allies in Central America was the fake
make-your-own-reality outcry about imaginary electoral fraud in the
2008 municipal elections. That has been followed up by a persistent
campaign of calumny accusing the electoral authorities of being corrupt
and Daniel Ortega himself of being a dictator worse than the
bloodthirsty Anastasio Somoza. Taking
their lead from the&nbsp; US State Department, right wing opposition
politicians, most of whom supported the fascist coup in Honduras,
invariably describe themselves, ridiculously, as the &#8220;democratic
opposition&#8221; and the FSLN government as a &#8220;dictatorship&#8221;.<br>
      <br>
Inside Nicaragua, only a forlorn elite minority buys that incoherent
propaganda fantasy. The routine daily facts contradict it constantly.
But outside Nicaragua, the grotesque absurdity of that rhetoric is lost
because the corporate media and much of what passes for progressive
media tends to echo the State Department script. Self-regarding phonies
on the neocolonial Left have shown they are more than ready to string
along with false US State Department propaganda. <br>
      <br>
The facts of the FSLN government's overwhelmingly positive record in
Nicaragua are beyond dispute. They entirely contradict the Obama-speak
declarations of US diplomats and the counterfactual nonsense of blatant
propaganda outlets like the Wall Street Journal. In Nicaragua, opinion
polls show that leading Nicaraguan opposition figures are as
discredited as the national and international media that try to puff
them up. <br>
      <br>
In current polls, the political movements of former FSLN leaders like
Dora Maria Tellez, Sergio Ramirez, Monica Baltodano, Victor Tirado
Lopez, Luis Carrion or Henry Ruiz barely register, with levels of
support at around 2%. Last week, two of Nicaragua's most prominent
business leaders condemned the opposition's failure to define policy
and their counterproductive dependence on an unconvincing fear
campaign. <br>
      <br>
Those business leaders want the kind of stable economic conditions
delivered by the FSLN government's programme, oriented towards
stimulating domestic production and meeting social needs. Nicaraguan
society from top to bottom recognizes the impressive achievements of
President Daniel Ortega's FSLN government across the board. So, for
the Nicaraguan opposition to have a fighting chance in the 2011
elections,
destabilization is the only option likely to work. That is the most
likely explanation for
the US government's militarization of Costa Rica.<br>
      <br>
The Serpico effect<br>
      <br>
Daniel Ortega's FSLN government's success has highlighted their
enemies' failings. By comparison, the US and the European Union look
incompetent and out of touch. President Ortega and his colleagues have
tried to do the right thing and they have done it well. They have
radically transformed Nicaragua's productive capacity, which has
involved initiating and sustaining revolutionary social improvements.
But paradoxically their success has failed to generate enthusiastic
support among international progressive opinion.<br>
      <br>
President Ortega and his colleagues find
themselves in a similar situation to the honest New York cop Frank
Serpico, trying to do the right thing in a hostile
environment. What Serpico's colleagues did was set him up in life
threatening situations and then leave him without support to get cut
down by the bad guys. That is exactly the attitude of moderately
progressive regional governments like those of Mauricio Funes in El
Salvador, or of Alvaro Colom in Guatemala. Similarly, ostensibly
progressive people and political movements in North America and Europe
sympathise with former FSLN leaders who now work closely with the
Nicaraguan right wing and the US
embassy. <br>
      <br>
Those progressive classes and movements may recognize the FSLN
government's achievements in Nicaragua, but for their own reasons &#8211;
network self-preservation, class solidarity and economic self-interest
&#8211;&nbsp; they play dumb. They have more to lose than to gain by openly
supporting President Ortega's FSLN government against the forces that
want to destroy it. They would rather ironically re-describe a
contingent Serpico getting carried into the ambulance than tell the
truth about their miserable failure to back him up.<br>
      <br>
A little over a year remains before the elections in Nicaragua. If they
happen as scheduled, events in Colombia and Venezuela may well have
worked to create a climate of extreme fear in the region that will
heavily favour the US&nbsp; government-supported Nicaraguan opposition.
If, as Fidel Castro and many others fear, crisis breaks out in either
Iran or Korea, the fallout may even see Nicaragua fall victim to some
variety of US military aggression. People in genuine solidarity with
Central America's majority are already working overtime to defend the
regional progress ALBA and Nicaragua's FSLN government have made
possible to date.<br>
