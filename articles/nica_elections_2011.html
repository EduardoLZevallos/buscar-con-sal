            <br>
            On Sunday November 6th, over 3 million eligible voters will
            go to the polls to vote in Nicaragua's presidential and
            legislative elections. <br>
            <br>
            They will be voting on three ballots for the Presidency, for
            Deputies to the National Assembly and for Deputies to the
            Central American Parliament.<br>
            <br>
            Five electoral alliances are on the ballots. They are :<br>
            <ul>
              <li>the Alianza Nicaragua Triunfa led by the Sandinista
                Front for National Liberation (FSLN) candidate Daniel
                Ortega<br>
              </li>
              <li> the Alianza PLI-MRS led by the the US-aligned
                oligarchy's right wing candidate Fabio Gadea</li>
              <li> the Alianza PLC-PC led by the nationalist right wing
                candidate Arnoldo Alem&aacute;n</li>
              <li> the Alianza ALN led by right wing ex-Somoza National
                Guard officer Enrique Qui&ntilde;onez</li>
              <li> the Alianza APRE led by a former official in previous
                right-wing administrations Roger Guevara</li>
            </ul>
            The most recent polls from opinion poll companies across the
            political spectrum agree in suggesting an easy first round
            win in the Presidential election for Daniel Ortega. <br>
            <br>
            The polls disagree on the amount of support for the
            opposition candidates.&nbsp; This is important in relation
            to the composition of the National Assembly for the period
            2012 to 2017.<br>
            <br>

              are the results of polls by the Consultora Siglo Nuevo
              company</a> regarded as being sympathetic to the FSLN. <br>
            <br>
            The last MyR poll and CID-Gallup polls &#8211; companies regarded
            as sympathising with the Nicaraguan opposition - broadly
            agree that Daniel Ortega has an insuperable lead on the
            presidential ballot. <br>
            <br>
            But they disagree with Consultora Siglo Nuevo about the
            relative strength of support for Arnoldo Alem&aacute;n and
            Fabio Gadea. They suggest that support for Fabio Gadea is
            far greater than that for Arnoldo Alem&aacute;n.<br>
            <br>
            Consultora Siglo Nuevo suggests that support for Arnoldo
            Alem&aacute;n has grown rapidly over the last weeks of the
            electoral campaign and that he is running almost level with
            Fabio Gadea. That corresponds to what happened during the
            last national elections in 2006.<br>
            <br>
            All the polls agree that Enrique Qui&ntilde;onez and Roger
            Guevara have minimal support in the presidential ballot of
            around 1%. <br>
            <br>
            Support for the parties on the presidential ballot does not
            necessarily translate into corresponding support for the
            parties on the two legislative ballots. So even parties
            whose candidates have little chance of doing well&nbsp; in
            the Presidential ballot stand a chance of getting
            representatives in the National Assembly and perhaps in the
            Central American Parliament.<br>
            <br>
            Crucial questions for the current Sandinista-led government
            are whether they will be able to get a majority in the
            National Assembly and how big that majority will be.<br>
            <br>
            The elections are being accompanied by teams from the
            European Union, from the Organization of American States,
            from the Council of Latin American Electoral Experts, from
            the regional electoral advisory institution the Tikal
            Protocol and from various national institutions including
            the National Council of Universities.<br>
            <br>
            Local electoral observation NGOs, for example Etica y
            Transparencia, closely identified with the political
            opposition, have been denied accreditation to accompany the
            electoral process by the Nicaraguan electoral authority,
            which argues that such partisan organizations are unable to
            work with the necessary impartiality.<br>
            <br>
            Voters will go to vote in over 12,000 polling stations
            around the country in the barrios and communities where they
            live. <br>
            <br>
            Representatives from each party at each polling
            station&nbsp; have to sign a document at the opening of the
            polling station. At the time appointed for closing the
            polling station the representatives of each party are
            present at the counting of the votes and have to sign a
            document to close the polling station which includes the
            number of votes received by each party in that polling
            station. <br>
            <br>
            A copy of that document is posted for local people to see
            the result. The result is communicated to the national count
            centre in Managua. The relevant documentation and the sealed
            voting urns are sent to the corresponding municipal office
            of the Supreme Electoral Council for subsequent transfer to
            the capital Managua.<br>
            <br>
            Results can be impugned by representatives of the different
            political parties in which case the complaint is heard by
            the relevant municipal office of Supreme Electoral Council.
            If unresolved, the complaint is passed to the corresponding
            departmental office of the Supreme Electoral Council and if
            unresolved at that level, is passed to the national Supreme
            Electoral Council whose decision is not subject to appeal.<br>
            <br>
            As the count progresses the Supreme Electoral Council issues
            periodic updates with the results to date.<br>
            <br>
            Subsequently the results of the elections have to be
            published in a national newspaper.<br>
            <br>
            In this electoral campaign, the opposition parties have made
            various false claims intended to call into question the
            validity and legitimacy of the elections. In fact, they
            themselves have given complete legitimcay to the electoral
            process by participating at every stage and every level as
            it has progressed. Not since the first ever democratic
            elections in Nicaragua in 1984 has any party boycotted an
            electoral process in the country.<br>
            <br>
            This year, the opposition parties have falsely claimed that
            tens of thousands of people have been denied their identity
            card. In fact, only a few thousand identity cards remain
            waiting to be claimed by their owners in the relevant
            offices of the Supreme Electoral Council. In any case,
            voters have until two days prior to the elections to claim
            either their identity card or a temporary supplementary
            voting document. Expired identity cards are also valid for
            their owners to vote in elections until December 2012.<br>
            <br>
            The opposition parties also falsely claim that Daniel
            Ortega's candidacy is illegal and that the very electoral
            authority itself is de facto. The facts refuting those
            spurious claims can be learned from <a
              href="video1.html">these
              interviews with the heads of Nicaragua's electoral
              authority and its Supreme Court</a>.<br>
            <br>
            The elections take place in the context of the country's
            recovery from widespread damage to infrastructure. Thousands
            of people throughout the country were evacuated to temporary
            shelters as a result of flooding caused by exceptionally
            heavy rains. The governing Sandinista party cancelled most
            of its electoral campaign activities so as to focus on the
            nationwide relief effort. <br>
            <br>
            The move reinforced even more the governing FSLN party's
            moral authority and electoral acceptance among the
            population. By contrast, the opposition parties failed to
            project themselves during the disaster caused by the rains
            as active and concerned. This is very likely to be an
            important factor in how people ultimately decide to vote on
            November 6th. <br>
