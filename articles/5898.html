in the Inauguration of Nicolás Maduro Moros<br />
Constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela</strong></p>

<p><strong>January 10th 2025</strong></p>

<div class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="460"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="252" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTXqz_oc0Mg" width="448"></iframe></div>

<p>Here I see a River of Divine Waters, an immense majority of Young People, of young men, of young women. Rubén Darío, in one of his Poems has a stanza where he wrote: "Youth, Divine Treasure!” And indeed it is so, it is the Youth, by their Commitment, by their Conscience, by their Commitment to Overcoming, in their Studies, in Social Struggles, in the Struggle for Sovereignty, in the Struggle for Independence, there is the Strength, there is the Magic of Youth.</p>

<p>That is why Revolutions throughout history have been led by Youth and so young People have multiplied with them... Nicolás was a boy when it began here, and here are the results, with this Youth, with this People, with this Socialist Party, with the Strength of Bolivia, the Bolivia that Bolívar made possible, with the Strength of our Heroes, of our Martyrs, in these Times, New Times, where as another Sandinista Poet said, referring to Andrés... Andrés Castro, a sergeant, a young man, fighting against the Yankee invaders there in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>They are incredible things... when the Yankees invaded Nicaragua, they wanted to take over the Canal Route, a route that had been opened because there was a thirst for Gold in the United States and the Americans were traveling overland across deserts, from the East Coast to the West Coast, and it was very dangerous; for there was still Indigenous Resistance; there were also assailants, criminals.</p>

<p>And an American businessman came up with the idea, he was a shipping entrepreneur, he came up with the idea of opening a route from New York to the coasts of Nicaragua. People embarked on big boats, then disembarked into small boats on the San Juan River, a river that runs along the border and flows into Lake Nicaragua, and from Lake Nicaragua to the Pacific Sea there is just a small stretch of land.</p>

<p>The company organized in such a way that passengers coming from New York were dropped off there on the shore of the Caribbean Sea where they were put into boats, small boats, that navigated the river, crossed the Lake, and arrived at the Pacific Coast where the Yankee company's ships were waiting, large ships ready to transport them to the West Coast where the Gold Rush was.</p>

<p>Then the Yankee businessman came, allied with forces from the Southern United States, from the slaveholding forces that were facing defeat, he came and moved to Nicaragua. Who brought them to Nicaragua? The sell out traitors. There is always a sell out.</p>

<p>The traitors invited them, thinking they were going to be useful to them, and when the Yankee was with his troops there in Nicaragua, what he did was start fighting the ones who did not want a Yankee take over of Nicaragua, and the same ones who had invited the Yankee also began to get shot. Because they had not invited him to take over Nicaragua, they had invited him as if he was going to be an employee, as if he was going to be their mercenary.</p>

<p>And what did the Yankees do back then? They invented an election, and they did the choosing, they were the ones who chose, in one of their totally fraudulent elections, when those on the Electoral Council were the self-same Yankees, the ones who counted the votes were the self-same Yankees, and thus they elected the Yankee leader, William Walker, they elected him President of Nicaragua. Look at the shame of it! President of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Nicaragua had just gained independence from Spain, in 1821, and slavery had been eradicated; but as soon as Walker seized the Presidency, the first thing he did was impose slavery in Nicaragua, and he began to try to defeat the Nicaraguan people who fought and fought and fought some more.</p>

<p>And in a famous Battle in the history of Nicaragua, on September 14th 1854, in that Battle, at Hacienda called San Jacinto, which is commemorated by all the children, all the Youth, because in that Battle the Yankee was defeated.</p>

<p>The Yankee had better weapons and people more experienced in war and they were fighting, when one of the Yankees wanted to jump over a wall where the Nicaraguan forces were, there was a mixture of mestizo Nicaraguan population there along with a detachment of indigenous people known in Nicaragua as the "Archers of Matagalpa", originally they were from Matagalpa, who had gone there to defend Nicaragua.</p>

<p>And there, when the Yankee lunged at Sergeant Andrés Castro, a young man, Andrés grabbed a stone and threw the stone and knocked the Yankee down. That's where it comes from then... David and Goliath!</p>

<p>So then one of our Compañeros, a Poet, a Revolutionary, Fernando Gordillo, composed a Poem where at the end he wrote, and it is a Poem that still holds true, because we cannot afford to be trusting : Andrés, he said in the poem, “Andrés, a century further on, the enemy remains the same. Throw your stone, throw it!”, for the enemy is the same.</p>

<p>And here the stone has been thrown by all of you, Brothers and Sisters, giving your vote to President Nicolás Maduro. And for today they had scheduled to bring another William Walker, to impose him here instead of Nicholas, but who is here? Did the pilot bring him, the pirate? No! Here is David, here is the Hero, here is the Revolutionary, Nicolás Maduro Moros! And here is Chávez, and here is Bolívar, here are all Venezuela's Heroes!</p>

<p>Long live the Youth of Venezuela!</p>

<p><strong>Remarks by President Nicolás Maduro</strong></p>

<p>I can tell the Comandante-in-Chief I did not know this story, Nicaragua has its David, who defeated the imperialist Goliath, and here we too have our David, our David is the Heroic Venezuelan People, Children of Bolivar. We are David! God is with us... who can be against us?</p>
