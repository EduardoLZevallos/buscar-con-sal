<h3><em><strong>Remarks by Compañera Rosario, Co-President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the Event Handing Over New Buses to Public Transport Cooepratives<br />
<br />
May 24th 2025</strong></em></h3>

<p>Good evening Compañera. As always, another intense, moving, strong and victorious review of events.</p>

<p>With our Comandante Daniel, today we are commemorating Comandante Germán Pomares Ordoñez, along with the Heroes of May, and our General Sandino; Comandante Daniel made this intense exploration of the Memory, the History and the Glory of this our People. Because we know that they wanted to destroy us in 2018, and as Comandante Daniel said, we were not prepared; we really thought that we were living in Peace, the Peace of Christ Jesus and the Peace that our People deserved.</p>

<p>But well, the demons came and sought to defeat us, but They Could Not Prevail, Nor Will They, thanks to the Strength of the Nicaraguan People. All of us were there waiting, knowing we were going to overcome, because the Character, the Identity and the Strength of the Nicaraguan People is invincible.</p>

<p>And I sincerely believe that those times of hatred strengthened in us the Faith in Love, in Love and Hope. Since that kind of hatred offers nothing, besides, being a class hatred since it was the rich classes wanting to crush the People, the Poor, the Workers, the Combatants. And that kind of hatred leads nowhere.</p>

<p>They were totally wrong, but how was Nicaragua left after that attempt to annihilate Love, and above all to annihilate Christian Love… Because when one saw people supposed to be Pastors promoting hatred, and when one saw there was no Spirituality there, one knew that Love is in the Hearts of Believers, and in the Hearts of the Poor.</p>

<p>Because Christ Jesus already said it, a poor person will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Kingdom of Heaven also here on Earth is Justice and Truth. While the rich don't fit through the eye of a needle. That’s how it is.</p>

<p>And we know that our faith in Love strengthened us all, the Certainty that Peace is built and defended with Love, because, precisely, for us Christians Love is Peace.<br />
And when one remembers all those stormy, horrible, terrible days, because that’s how it was to see the disfigured faces of those who had pretended to be comrades on the Ways to the Well-being of all Nicaraguans, those faces disfigured by hatred, decomposed, one knew they were not the ones who were going to continue on Paths of Peace or the Struggle for Well-being.</p>

<p>No, it wasn't them, there history showed us what they had wanted to hide, because they were indeed hiding, concealing, some among others, the business people, the evil minded ones, and also some representatives of the Catholic Church, unfortunately. Because we are Catholics, those of us who grew up as Catholics, and it was terrible to see the real faces of those who proclaimed themselves as Leaders of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>I remember that someone asked: Well, and in the second phase of the Dialogue should the Bishops have a place? Comandante Daniel answered them very wisely: Yes, of course, but with the Opposition, not as leaders of a Process that must to lead us to Reunion and Peace. But with the Opposition, which caused so much damage, so much death, so much suffering, so much destruction, of course.</p>

<p>And now we know what and how to value, because I believe all those perverse events also served to help us value Peace, to value our Revolutionary Process, to value ourselves, as a Brave, Heroic People, the People of Sandino, the People of Darío. Valuing what we have and defending it.</p>

<p>Let's Go Onward! And as Comandante Daniel was saying, we are better off now... We are better, we are stronger, we are clearer, besides, about who is who, and we are sure that we have the greatness of Soul, because it is necessary to have such a Soul to defend Peace, Justice and True Truths.</p>

<p>So, we are now 46, For ever 19, and we are going to celebrate one other, as a Great, Heroic, Victorious People, and above all a People who love Peace, who live in Peace, and who know, because do we know for sure that it is with Peace that we are building the Future.</p>

<p>The Peace that is Justice, the Peace that is Truth, True Truths, and the Peace that guarantees us our Future, that Future of Rights. Because Education is a Right, Health Care is a Right, Public Transport is a Right, Highways are Rights. All progress is a Right, to emerge from the infamous, sacrilegious poverty that was imposed on us.</p>

<p>An embrace to all Nicaragua’s families, and a special embrace to all Mothers. We are Combative, we are Valiant, we are Brave, We are Love and we are Peace!</p>

<p>Warm embraces, Compañer@s, wishing to all Families the desire, and above all the Commitment, for work every day bringing more Peace and making more Progress by means of Work, Security, Stability... Progressing and Prospering, as we all deserve. Thank you, may we all be well.</p>
