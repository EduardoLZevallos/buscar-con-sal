<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We commemorate that Epic, our Epic of this People of God, with a Heart full of Valiant History, of Courage, of determined Insubordination to the Empires which have always tried to dominate us, overwhelm us and crush the Soul and the Flames of Burning, Invincible Fire, which animate, as if in a Sacred Cauldron, this Blessed, Prodigious, Miraculous Nicaragua, which Always Marches Further On.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We fly the flags of the Holy, Sacred Blood spilled defending the Ideals and Values the Imperialists of the Earth tried to usurp and snatch away from us. This Sacred Blood nourishes our undefeated way. This Sacred Blood strengthens our Energy, our Vigor, our Legendary Tenacity, Our Commitment, and Responsibility to continue creating anew our World, our Country, our Society, Always New, where Fraternity, Affection, Justice and Peace, become the Force and Strength of Dignity.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Yesterday the 22nd, today the 23rd, Tuesday the 27th, soon Victorious September, and every day, we make our way in strict adherence to the Sandinista Ideology of Affirming Our Dignity, of Overcoming Poverty, Continuing to Overcome the malevolence and domination of Empires and of World Capitalism which, as we said, and we still say, is Evil from the start, robbing the Peoples of our Rights.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">That Savage Capitalism, through Imperialism and Colonialism, has unleashed wars, genocides and fratricides along with divisions and partitions convenient to its interests, so as to hoard away the Patrimony and Riches of our Peoples, to take them away from us, to continue stealing what is ours. But in these Times, with this History of Victories, that Savage Capitalism, that Imperialism collapsing in on itself, this Colonialism that our Peoples United have been defeating, cannot prevail, Nor will it.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We fight against the Yankee<br />
Humanity's enemy!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We salute the Exemplary Victory of Dignity, Sovereignty and Bravery of the People of Bolívar, of Chávez, of Nicolás, our Brother and Sister People, in Beloved Venezuela who, along with all Our Americans, inspires the World in decisive Battles to respect us, as too the interventionist, meddling, invading Powers should respect us. Those Powers that made themselves great out of our Cultures and our Humanity. </span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Those criminal Powers have no Right to continue stealing our Patrimony, nor will our courageous Spirit allow it, of course, motivating and strengthening us every day, as the Sword of Bolivar, the Flag of Sandino, the Brilliance of Martí, the Aura of Fidel, of Chávez, rally together in triumph, ... The Soul of all the Revolutions of Working Peoples, by which We Go Onward with Faith, striving to continue exposing, proving and overcoming the shamelessness of the proponents of genocide, because we are the honest legitimate millions, children of these Lands, who “make the Truth come True”.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">That Truth is unobjectionable, undisguised. It comes from the Peoples who have said with us Enough, and we make our way... This is the Truth of the Peoples who rise up with a Giant's Voice, crying Onward...! That inalienable Truth belonging to the People that we are Free and Will Never Be Slaves Again.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">With our Noble National History, of a Great Patriotic Nation, of a Christian, Socialist and Solidarity-inspired Nation, we are moving onward, and we know that the Future is ours.</span></span></strong></p>

<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
 </p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>HOWL THEN, PANCHO CABULLA!</b></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">This week we have worked hard so as to serve better.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We have been making the indispensable changes so that every Program to Protect the Rights of our People, every Project, every Proposal and Purpose, are, as they should be, Programs, Projects and Proposals, of Work, of Progress, of the Future.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Historical Programs, from the Sandinismo of Always Further On, to overcome Poverty, to overcome Misery, which is a disgrace, because Misery dishonors the whole Human Family.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And here we are then, breaking the chains, heroically and decisively healing the wounds that Imperialism, Colonialism, Savage Capitalism have been leaving, as they have tried to “devour us better”.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We know, from our own Knowledge, Conviction and Experience, that we are brave people... Without fear... That we are Free Spirits... That we are generations of generations, Guerrillas and Warriors. That we are the People of Liberation, in the Glorious Sandinista National Liberation Front, today and at all times. That we are the Force that ensures, that guarantees, Integrity, Change and the Indispensable Models for us to live as we deserve, in Freedom, Dignity, Well-being, Fraternity, Prosperity, All Together, creating every day, the New, the Necessary, all that we truly deserve... Because we are the Joy of Living to the Full working, thriving, enjoying the Peace that has cost us so much.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We fight against the Yankee<br />
the enemy of humanity!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And so we go, all of us... Here we go, here the People with Daniel; with Zeledón, our indispensable General; with Sandino, our Father... Here we go too with Andrés, José Dolores, Diriangén, Nicarao, Adiact... Here we go with Carlos, Visionary Comandante Carlos... Here we go with Tomás, the Intrepid, Audacious, uncompromising Militant, the one who pronounced, with absolute authority, the condemnation, also absolute, of traitors and cowards, who as he himself said, “are footnotes from a story long past”. One that won't return. One that will not be repeated. Because They Cannot Prevail, Nor Will They.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">With the validity and pride of all our Epics, of all our Victories that are the heroism of the People, Victories that have been defeats of the Imperialists of the Earth in our Nicaragua... With the validity of that Immensity, of that Eternity that flares on the shoulders of a Great People, we are sure, we are certain, we know indeed, because truly, there is no stopping the People and we will continue to win more and more Victories.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>NO RETURN TO THE PAST!</b></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">The Triumphs take place, because we are Together, because we make a Single Fist, bringing literacy, learning, producing, working, in every possible way... A single Fist defending Peace, Harmony, Union, which is our Inheritance, conquered with Sacred Blood, as we have said, and we repeat.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">A single Fist to continue achieving the Dreams and Merits of so much Nobility, of so much Desire for Sovereignty and Decorum; of so much Patriotic Nation and Freedom... Out of so much Struggle so that the Horizons that belong to us, are truly ours, never again to be abused by stateless, servile lackeys and bickerers, who confuse Human Geography staring at Maps of a Nicaragua that is not theirs, one that is alien to them, a Nicaragua that belongs rather to those who have given everything, and who continue to give everything, so that we may live, so that we may be as we are, so that we continue to be a Patriotic Nation of Independence, Peace and the Future.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>A FREE NATION, A PATRIOTIC NATION AND FREEDOM!</b></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Since these days of ours are of National Celebration. Because the unprecedented and Incomparable Feat of the Taking of the National Palace is our Nation... Because the National Literacy Crusade is our Victorious and Gallant Nation... Because the defense of Nicaragua's Right to Sovereignty and Peace, throughout our entire history, is that of a Nation... Because ours is a Blessed, full of Blessings, a Fervent and Loving Nation, every Human Being is aware of our Humanity, risen up against injustice, lies, corruption, betrayal, conspiracy, the sale of the Sacred Land that saw us born.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And after all it is Nation building to banish treason, to banish hatred, evil, perversion. To banish terrorism, cowardice, insensitivity. To banish frailty. To banish those who do not belong, because they do not love. Because they faint into the profane arms of foreign oppressors, like vassals who reproduce, for miserable crumbs, the methods of exploitation, extermination and crimes against humanity of their promoters, of their political and financial sponsors, of their aberrant and abhorrent overseers.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Nicaragua is Free and with a Future, because she has Daughters and Sons who love her. Because we love her. Because we love each other as a People, as Nicaraguan by race who are familiar with Struggles and Honor. From the Christian, Socialist and Solidarity inspired Love that we practice, we are creating the Future, and we will not stop!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Nicaragua is Free and will Remain Free, because we live by Light, Life and Truth. And because we are the Daughters and Sons of the Best, of the Extraordinary, of the Great, of the Eternal, of those who bequeathed us the Honor of Victories over the Imperialists of the Earth. The honor of having led legendary defeats against the base and ignoble. The honor of having expelled them forever and more, from our Lands... All of them, those who only know how to kill, to rob, to assault, to usurp, to subjugate, and to impose... we have driven them out and defeated them. Forever. Never Again! Honor, Glory and Victories to our great Ancestors!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>SANDINO LIVES ON, LIVES ON, LIVES ON!</b></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Here is Sandino... Here is Zeledon... Here are the Heroes of Pancasán... Here are the heroes of Bocay... Here are the Heroes of the Sandinista Popular Insurrection, the Heroes of the Triumph of the Revolution, and of the Triumph over the Counterrevolution; the Heroes of the Triumph over Somocismo in all its forms... Here are the Heroes and Martyrs, of all times... And here we are in this Age of Peoples... We are a Territory Free of Hatred, of Evil, of Betrayal. We are Peoples who make our way onward in Light, and among True Truths!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Here are our Stars, our Battles, Always Bright. And here, above all, is the First Revolutionary, Christ Jesus, showing us the Ways of Love, teaching us to live like Brothers and Sisters, to love our Neighbor as ourselves... And here is the Heroic Cultural Heritage of a Christian, Socialist, Solidarity inspired People, who love, and because they love, They Do Not Sell Out, Nor Do They Surrender, Ever.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Here no one surrenders!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Here no one surrenders!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Here no one surrenders!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And Here, where Sandino Lives On and the Struggles Continue, We Go Onward, with Daniel, with the Frente, and the People as President, winning the Battles of Life in Capital Letters.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>THE SHINING WORLD BEING BORN</b></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">The Sandinistas are Dignity and National Sovereignty. The Sandinistas are the Force of Christian Love and the Certain Hope of a World, of a Country and of the Human Person, Worthy, full of Solidarity and Joy. Because Love is Joy. While Hatred and Betrayal are the inner death of those who have lost meaning in their Life. They are corpses, mummies, drifting flotsam, who have no place at all in the Kingdom of God on Earth.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">Life is pronounced from the Great Fraternity of Beings capable of giving everything so that Humanity prevails and flourishes as a transcendent Path of Peace and Rights, of the Nation that is precisely Humanity.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">We are the Force, the Power<br />
of this shining World being born<br />
this World that overcomes and marches<br />
Always Further On!</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight: normal">And so, as we make our way, the Future is ours, we pulsate with the formidable History of whence we came, and in these Times of Victories, where we are now, and too where we are going! For sure! For sure!</span></span></strong></p>
