<p><strong>NO TO US STATE TERRORISM IN THE CARIBBEAN SEA<br />
NO TO US PLANS FOR REGIME CHANGE IN VENEZUELA<br />
CARICOM MUST ACT NOW</strong></p>

<p><strong>October 8, 2025</strong><br />
<br />
Organization for the Victory of the People (OVP) rejects the false narrative peddled by the Trump Administration, claiming that President Nicolas Maduro and his administration are connected to drug trafficking into the United States. The world is tired of US imperialism’s playbook, creating false flags and narratives in order to initiate wars and orchestrate regime change.</p>

<p>President Ali and the PPP Government, in collusion with the Trump Administration, are leading Guyana in a direction that can only bring us chaos and catastrophe. War with our neighbor can never be in our best interest. The current dispute between Guyana and Venezuela, while framed as a territorial dispute, is related to much larger and more menacing issues. Guyana and Venezuela are both victims of our colonial past. Like many nation-states throughout the Global South, the drawing of the border that separates our countries is disputed, and we have lived with this controversy since 1899.</p>

<p>Both the Guyanese and Venezuelan populations have been raised to believe that the disputed Essequibo region is theirs, and both populations vehemently defend their position. The imperialists never sleep, exacerbating and exploiting any divisions they can find, constantly working to undermine and sabotage efforts to promote regional unity.</p>

<p>We applaud Bolivarian Republic President Nicolas Maduro for the restraint that he and his administration has shown, despite the barefaced provocation by the US war mongers. President Maduro, like so many leaders throughout the Global South, is well aware of US tactics and is refusing to react in a way that gives the Empire its desired outcome. However, make no mistake, should the US invade Venezuela, in addition to its well-equipped and formidable armed forces, large sections of the population are mobilized, armed and ready to resist. In this region, like Haiti, dating back to the days of Jean-Jaques Dessalines, Venezuela, dating back to the days of Simón Bolivar, has long been a bastion of resistance to Yankee aggression.</p>

<p>As neighbours, the only way forward is for Guyana and Venezuela to come together and resolve any differences we may have, without foreign interference. Over the years, the US has at times backed Venezuela in this territorial dispute, when they opposed the government of Guyana, and now, is backing Guyana because they oppose the revolutionary government in Venezuela. As former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger cynically observed: “The US has no permanent friends and no permanent enemies, only permanent interests”.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Guyana’s government is so firmly entrenched in a neo-colonial arrangement with the US Empire and its oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron, that it is allowing itself to be dragged into a war with its neighbor under false pretenses. The US is posing as our savior, and the only entity that can stand between us and a Venezuelan invasion of Guyana. In reality, Venezuela has no intention of invading Guyana. This would be a suicidal mission, since it would provide the US with the excuse it needs to invade the Bolivarian Republic and roll back the revolution instigated by Hugo Chavez in 1999.</p>

<p>The real story behind the false narratives attempting to destabilize the region, is that Venezuela’s current issue with Guyana is rooted in our close collusion with their sworn enemies, the US and ExxonMobil. Hugo Chavez expelled ExxonMobil from Venezuela when he came to power, ending decades of their exploitation and plunder of Venezuela’s oil wealth.  OVP has pointed out on numerous occasions that ExxonMobil is no ordinary corporate entity but is an arm of US imperialism.</p>

<p>The day after President Ali was sworn in for a second term on September 7, 2025, a delegation, led by US Deputy Assistant Secretary of War for the Western Hemisphere, Joseph Humire, flew into Guyana for a visit. Guyana is currently awash with CIA operatives, and we have allowed these hostile entities to operate on Venezuela’s border, which is rightfully perceived by the Maduro-led government as a direct threat to Venezuela’s sovereignty. Far from the US being our savior in this instance, it is, as usual, the cause of our problems.</p>

<p>Guyana is for all intents and purposes a ‘captured State'. As President Ali was being sworn in, two US fighter jets flew overhead in a shocking display of the close and treacherous alliance between the Ali-led government and the US Empire. We urge President Ali, even as he refuses to heed the warnings of his fellow countrymen and women, to heed the words of Henry Kissinger: “It may be dangerous to be America’s enemy, but to be America’s friend is fatal”.</p>

<p>OVP endorses the statement made by President Petro of Columbia, who when addressing the UN General Assembly on September 23, 2025, said that the drugs that reach the US are not coming from Venezuela, and pointed out that his government has implemented extremely successful anti-drug trafficking policies in Colombia.</p>

<p>In 2023 and 2024, President Petro’s government seized the largest amount of cocaine in the history of Colombia and extradited over 700 drug traffickers to the US and Europe, in the face of death threats from the drug mafia. President Petro spoke of US complicitly with the drug traffickers in South America, and reminded the UN General Assembly of the horrific massacres that had taken place in Colombia: “Thousands of peasants were murdered by politicians, senators and presidents, all of whom were on the payroll of the Colombian drug mafia, and who were allies of the extreme right politicians in Florida, and are now allies of the Trump administration. The US has been allied with the drug lords in Colombia for decades.”</p>

<p>President Petro went on to highlight the fact that the US so-called war on drugs has nothing to do with stopping cocaine from entering the US but is rather a pretext for dominating the people of the South. He presented clear evidence of this, when he asked the UN General Assembly to reflect on the question of why he had been “decertified” by President Trump, when his predecessor, President Duque was not decertified, despite the fact that Duque’s presidential campaign was funded by a well-known Colombian drug lord, and the percentage of coco crops was at 43% under Duque’s administration,  and has been reduced to just 3% since President Petro’s government took office in 2022.<br />
<br />
We in South America can testify to President Petro’s account, based on our lived experience; that the US, and its agencies are active enablers of the drug trafficking in the region. OVP applauds President Petro for his courageous exposé, even while he was on US soil. From the UN podium, President Petro proclaimed that  “the real drug traffickers do not live in Latin America, they live in New York, just a few blocks away from here, in Miami...they reach agreements with the DEA, and are allowed to traffic in Africa, in Russia, in China but not in the United States, a country that has not managed to reduce its consumption of cocaine...rather they did manage to reduce their consumption of cocaine because their addicts switched to another drug, fentanyl which is much deadlier. This fentanyl is produced in the industrial heartland of the United States...the majority of drug traffickers are blond and have blue eyes and they keep their fortunes in the largest banks in the world. They don’t live in Bogota or Caracas, they live in Miami, they are neighbours of President Trump. They live in Dubai, Paris and London.”</p>

<p>OVP unequivocally condemns the extra-judicial killings carried out by the US military in the Caribbean Sea, claiming the lives of 21 Venezuelan and Colombian nationals. Why are our people being targeted by missiles, when they could be arrested on the alleged suspicion of drug trafficking at gunpoint? We know why. It is because these small boats and civilians are being targeted arbitrarily. If they were arrested, and the boats searched, the US would have to provide evidence of their involvement in drug trafficking, evidence that does not exist. Fishermen in the region are afraid to go out to sea because they know only too well that the US can and will obliterate any small vessel and crew and claim it as a legitimate target in their fake war on drug trafficking. We can say this breaks international law; however, the genocide in Gaza has surely proved that law is only useful if it can be enforced. This is naked fascism and State terrorism.</p>

<p>Furthermore, OVP unequivocally opposes US plans to establish a military base in Guyana. We are putting President Ali and his government on notice that any such installation will be met with a unified and relentless resistance, not only in Guyana, but across the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>OVP is calling on CARICOM member states to stand firm. CARICOM must act now, reaffirming the Caribbean as a zone of peace. We call on CARICOM to issue a strong warning to the US to halt its acts of State terrorism in the Caribbean Sea, and reject US attempts to use any CARICOM member state as a launching pad for aggression against Venezuela or any nation in our region.</p>

<p>In addition to our condemnation of the Guyana government’s cowardly and misguided acquiescence to US attempts to destabilize this region, we condemn Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar’s government in Trinidad and Tobago for its shameful support of US plans for regime change in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Finally, OVP is calling on Prime Minister Mitchell and the government of Grenada to refuse the US request to deploy US military assets on its territory. Grenada is viewed by Washington as an exceptionally strategic location for its current operations, given that the island lies approximately 100 miles from the Venezuelan coastline.</p>

<p>We must reject this revival of the obsolete Munroe Doctrine. We must not succumb to the notion of geographical fatalism. In the immortal words of Grenada’s former revolutionary leader, Maurice Bishop, himself a victim of a CIA orchestrated coup, “we are in nobody’s backyard".<br />
