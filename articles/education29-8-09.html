On August 22nd 2009, the 29th anniversary of the end of the historic
National Literacy Cruzade, Education Minister Miguel de Castilla
presented a ministerial placard to President Daniel Ortega declaring
Nicaragua as territory free of illiteracy. Nicaragua is now officially
the fifth country in Latin America to be declared free of illiteracy
along with Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia and Costa Rica. <br>
<br>
At the end of June a delegation of experts from UNESCO visited the
country to verify the governent's claim that, as a result of the two
year long National Literacy Campaign, the percentage of illiterates in
Nicaragua had fallen below 5%. The delegation was indeed able to
confirm that, Nicaragua had an illiteracy rate of 4.1%.
The literacy campaign continues, however, and by August 15th the rate
had fallen to 3.46, according to Minister Miguel de Castilla. <br>
<br>
"On August 22nd, the day Nicaragua was declared free of illiteracy,
educators were working, teaching people to read and write," said
minister de Castilla in <a href="../tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/3075.html">an
interview with Alberto Mora</a>. "Our aim is to
have reduced the percentage of illiterates to 3% by November 7th. If we
achieve that we would have one of the lowest rates of illiteracy in
Latin America together with Cuba. We would have less illiteracy than
Costa Rica." &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>"It is
impossible to imagine even a minimum level of development in a country
full of illiterates. By declaring the nation free of illiteracy, our
government has laid the foundations for the future of education in our
country. But this is only the first step, the first rung on a very tall
ladder."&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ten Year Plan: that
all Nicaraguans graduate from secondary school</span><br>
<br>
"We are by no means satisfied with what has been done so far. All we
have done is to tackle the first obstacle. The tasks facing us now are
enormous - we must overcome the chasms created by bad quality
education, by illiteracy
and by former government's total disregard for education. Overcoming
all that
is going to be an immense challenge," said de Castilla<br>
<br>
Currently the Ministry of Education is coordinating a nationwide
consultation process involving all the people who took part in the
national literacy campaign, either as teachers or as pupils, as well as
education authorities and specialists from diverse institutions and
organizations in order to create the nation's Ten Year Education Plan:
2011 - 2021. <br>
<br>
The fundamental aim of this plan is that all those who learned to read
and write during the literacy campaign will have completed primary
school by 2015 and&nbsp;secondary school by 2021. The nationwide
consultations process aims to determine the specifics and logistics of
how this mammoth task will be carried out. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
As Minister de Castilla points out "foreign cooperation organizations
often order this type of medium term education development plan to be
carried out as part of the process of rationalizing the use of
cooperation funds and resources. The difference is that, when a foreign
organization oversees the plan it is consulted with academics. After
the academics have given it the go ahead the government adopts the
plan. But in Nicaragua ordinary people, the ones who will take part in
the education process, are the ones who are creating the ten year plan."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary education
is the long term answer </span><br>
<br>
De Castilla is the first to admit that literacy campaigns "are not the
cure to the social disease called illiteracy. The real cure is quality
primary education." For that reason "our most important work is about
ensuring quality primary education for impoverished children and young
people." <br>
<p>On this subject (the government's policy on primary
school education) Tortilla con Sal was able to talk about the reality
on the ground in the municipality of Estelí with Melania Peralta
Ramírez, Ministry of Education Delegate for the municipality of Estelí,
and Lucía Nubia Centeno Castro, Director of the Rubén Darío Primary
School in the town of Estelí.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delegate Melania Peralta was able to confirm that the
number of students registered in public schools (preschool, primary and
secondary) across the municipality has experienced an "incredible"
increase since 2007&nbsp;when the FSLN government re-nationalized
the
education system eliminating charges in public schools.&nbsp;</p>
Director Nubia Centeno explains the logic behind the influx of pupils
into the public education system since 2007: "In this school we have
pupils whose parents work as shoe shiners, tortilla makers, building
assistants, market vendors and factory workers. It is not possible to
expect these parents, with what they earn, to be able to keep a family
and still have enough to pay for their children's education."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
As
well as the increase in the number of pupils attending
school, the
desertion rate has dropped to a record 8% in the municipality. Peralta
and Centeno put this down to, among other things, the fact that all
primary school
pupils, in the countryside and in the towns, recieve a free school meal
everyday. <br>
<br>
The school meals program has also helped to
stimulate academic achievement. Last year Estelí schools averaged an
85% pass rate - a record for the municipality.&nbsp;"It's a very
different thing trying to teach something to a hungry child than it is
to a child with a full tummy," says Centeno. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Education budget
has not been limited despite economic crisis</span><br>
<br>
Incredibly, despite the impact of the
international economic crisis, the government has not
limited resources destined to key parts of its education policy like
the provision of school uniforms, rucksacks and shoes for the most
impoverished students, classroom learning materials and school meals,
assured Peralta.
Nor, she said, have the municipal authorities needed to dismiss any
teachers or other workers, although they have not been able to take on
new members of staff. <br>
<br>
"Despite the international crisis, it is during this
administration when the basic conditions and materials have been
provided for our schools," says Peralta. "Today teachers have all the
material
necessary to carry out classes - paper, pens, books, etc.. On top of
that they take part in monthly teaching training workshops."<br>
<br>
Another important aspect of the government's education policy that has
provoked positive change in the classroom in the new curriculum and the
monthly teacher training workshops known as TEPCEs (Planning,
Evaluation, Education Training Workshops). <br>
<br>
Director Centeno believes the teachers at Rubén Darío have acquired
a greater ability to analyze and plan their teaching thanks to the
TEPCE teacher training regime. "What happenes at the monthly TEPCE
workshops is that all the teachers get together to self-train
themselves, exchanging ideas and classroom experiences. We look at what
we have achieved and analyze what we can do to improve our work." <br>
<br>
The importance of the new curriculum is based on the fact that it
is more pupil orientated, says Centeno. The new curriculum "encourages
pupils to participate in class because&nbsp;evaluation is not based
on
exams - children are permanently evaluated, everyday. This encourages
pupils to take responsibility for their attendance and involve
themselves in class activity," explains Centeno.&nbsp; <br>
