      <br>

It was hard not to feel impacted by the asymmetry between the current
situations in Nicaragua and Honduras on Sunday 29th November as I
accompanied my niece to the Children's Fair in <span style="font-style: italic;">La Plaza San Juan Pablo
II</span> in Managua. <br>

      <br>

For the first time in her life this twelve year old girl
from a severely impoverished farming family was able to attend a
circus, skate on an ice rink and have a go on a fairground ride as part
of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Feria de los Niños
Felices </span>organized
and paid for by the FSLN government in an attempt to ensure a happily
memorable Christmas season for Nicaragua's children. <br>

      <br>

We even
got to have a go on a bosun's
chair belonging to the Civil Defence and have a look inside a
Nicaraguan Air Force plane, a Navy
speedboat, and an antique fire engine from the 1950s.<br>

      <br>

My niece was one of the more than 100,000 children to attend the fair
during its first three days. The government expects over 1.5 million
children to attend the fair during the 37 days it is open.<br>

      <br>

Security in the plaza is guaranteed by a hefty presence of Nicaragua's
National Police, a force internationally recognized for its
professionalism and people-friendly ethic since its foundation during
the first stage of the Sandinista Revolution in the 1980s. Meanwhile
the rides and other attractions are staffed by volunteers from the
Sandinista youth organization "<span style="font-style: italic;">19 de
Julio</span>." <br>

      <br>

The government has been criticized by opposition parties for spending
tens of thousands of dollars on this fair which
they claim could have been better invested in the country's education
and
health systems. These criticisms are hard to swallow though, given the pitiful
state in which the opposition left the country's public services after
16 years of uninterrupted rule. <br>

      <br>

And to be honest, I would have to agree with
government spokesperson Rosario Murillo's answer to detractors that "a
child's smile is priceless," especially given that we are talking about
children who have suffered as much general hardship as the majority of
Nicaragua's children have.<br>

      <br>

But while my niece was being helped on and off rides by young
Sandinista volunteers and shown around Armed Force vehicles by friendly
Nicaraguan soldiers, my mind kept returning to events in Honduras where
the coup regime's farcical elections were taking place. <br>

      <br>
      <a href="tortilla/node/4711.html">
In a statement</a> issued on the evening of November 29th the heroic
National Resistance Front Against the Coup declared the "defeat" of the
"electoral farce carried out by the dictatorship" thanks to "the
highest
level of abstention in the country's history." <br>

      <br>

According to the
Resistance, which monitored the turnout at polling stations nationwide,
at least 65% to 70% of registered Honduran voters abstained. The
majority did so in support of the organization's call to
boycott the anomalous electoral process. <br>

      <br>

The unprecedented attendance of the Assembly organized by the
Resistance which took place in Tegucigalpa on November 30th to
celebrate the
"people's victory" against the coup regime served to further
consolidate the fact that the majority of Honduran people, by not
voting, expressed their approval of the Resistance anti coup stance. <br>

      <br>

This observation is
particularly relevant given the unceasing violent repression (the
beatings, the torture, the rapes, the murders) to which anti coup
demonstrators have been subjected by the Honduran police and army
since President Manuel Zelaya was kidnapped from his home and exiled to
Costa Rica in the early hours of June 28th. <br>

      <br>

Indeed on the day of the "elections" peaceful anti coup marches in
different parts of Honduras were brutally repressed by security forces
leaving dozens of people wounded and illegally detained. <br>

      <br>

According to
the government of this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, though, the
electoral process constitutes a positive step towards a solution to the
Honduran crisis. In a statement issued on November 30th US State
Department spokesperson Ian Kelly "congratulated the Honduran people
for the peaceful exercise of their democratic right to elect their
governors" and confirmed that the US plans to "work closely with the
government of Porfirio&nbsp; Lobo."<br>

      <br>

And all the while the US is actively working to undermine the FSLN
government in Nicaragua, a government which not only implements an
unblemished policy of zero repression against its people, but that has
actually made unprecedented progress in areas critical to the
well-being of its people like literacy and food security. <br>

      <br>

At just a couple of hundred kilometres distance Managua and Tegucigalpa
are worlds apart. And going by the State Department's response to the
developing political situation in both capitals, it is clear who's side
the US government is on. <br>
