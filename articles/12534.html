<p><strong>Rosario's address</strong></p>

<p>Thank you, Gustavo. And thank you to the Sandinista National Liberation Front. To our Heroic People.</p>

<p>These are always exciting and moving moments, because we have in our hearts, in our memories, in our minds, all those who with their Sacred Blood have made possible these New Times.</p>

<p>It moves us, and commits us to give thanks to God because He has allowed us to live through all the circumstances, the happy circumstances, the difficult circumstances, to live and fill our hearts with Love and commitment to serve our People all day long.</p>

<p>How can we thank each one of the Militant Comrades for their nomination, the nomination of us that they have made? How can we thank the Nicaraguan People, Heroic, of Glories and Victories? How else can we give thanks if not with the highest Sense of Commitment, to continue fighting, to continue working so as to see the smile of the Children, to see the tranquility of Mothers, because we live in a Country in Peace, with Family Values, of Community, and with Security.</p>

<p>How else to give thanks for the commitment of our Nicaragua's Heroic Youth, of all Times...! We say Heroic Pancasán, on account of that Youth ready for sacrifice, ready for Commitment. And I have always in my heart the poem of Fernando Gordillo: "I sing the courage of those who dream / even with their feet in the mud."</p>

<p>Those generations of Brothers and Sisters who dreamed, who were capable of dreaming and giving their Life even though they knew that Victory would only come about with Time and with the Courage that we Nicaraguans know very well. As today we also know how to affirm that Victory, and Victories, are borne on the shoulders of all the Sandinista Militants and all the Heroic, Hard Working, Loving and Victorious Families of our Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>And here we are ready to continue serving with all our hearts, to continue the fight against Poverty, to get out of Poverty, God willing, with our dedication, our work, and that permanent Invocation to the Heavenly Father, to the Most High, to Our Mother Mary, that permanent Invocation so they continue pouring over our Homeland the Blessings and so that they continue strengthening us every day with Strength of Spirit !</p>

<p>We are a Great, a Great People, of Honor and Glory, of Victories, from a Great, Great Spirit that deserves Glory and Victories.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Compañeros. Our Commitment is to serve, our Commitment is to move forward together, walking in Concord, in Peace, in Family Values, in Community, to defeat Poverty.</p>

<p>Thank you, Compañer@s.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel's address</strong></p>

<p>Twelve thirty in the afternoon, August 2nd. The month of August is a month that reflects the reality of Nicaragua and of any people in the world, where there is a mixture of joy, pain, struggle, creating, and also destroying.</p>

<p>How many Brothers and Sisters fighting for Nicaragua, fighting for Humanity, gave their lives in the month of August, from Selim, our Brother Selim Shible. I cannot stop remembering him and mentioning him, because we are of a generation that grew up, from the age of 13, 14 years old we were already there fighting, and at the age of 15 going to jail, and coming out of jail continuing the fight. And in the battle, Selim giving his life, a Hero who is present with all the Heroes and Martyrs of August.</p>

<p>This Congress is a Congress that we are dedicating to the Heroes of Pancasan, to the Heroic Feat of Pancasan. And I mention there, leading that Guerrilla unit that developed in Pancasán, leading the Sandinista Front, our Elder Brother, Carlos Fonseca, Commander Carlos Fonseca Amador, who was with Francisco Moreno, a boy who was in High School, finishing High School, but who was also in the struggle, and who joined the Guerrilla Column of Pancasán.</p>

<p>Well, it occurred to Francisco Moreno, on his own initiative, to start there teaching the first letters, the alphabet, to teach reading and writing to one of the many peasants who had joined the Guerrilla and who did not know how to read or write. And Carlos passed by and said: "Yes, teach them also to read and write". This historic phrase speaks of the heart of the men and women who joined the struggle with the Sandinista National Liberation Front.</p>

<p>And in Pancasán how many Brothers, how many Comrades, gave their lives for Liberty, for Justice, for a truly Free and Sovereign Nicaragua. And today, in this Historic Congress of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, we pay homage, together with Carlos, to our Brother Silvio Mayorga, also a Founder of the Sandinista Front together with Carlos; to our Brother Rigoberto Cruz (Pablo Úbeda), originally from Chontales, he was also a Founder of the Front and of the Front's Leadership.</p>

<p>Well, our Brother Francisco Moreno also gave his blood there; Otto Casco, Fausto García, Oscar Danilo Rosales, the doctor who left his work, his classes, his professorships, in León, to join the Guerrilla; Nicolás Sánchez, "the Tiger of Cerro Colorado", a Peasant; Carlos Reyna, Ernesto Fernández, Carlos Tinoco.</p>

<p>The brutal torture and murder of peasant brothers who were with the Front there in the mountains and who were harassed and murdered, such as Eufrosino Dávila, Eucadio Picado, Moisés Picado, Felipe Gaitán, Fermín Díaz and his five children. And Oscar Armando Flores... Oscar Armando Flores was tied up by the executioners, trained by the Yankees, managed by the Yankees and blessed by the Clergy.</p>

<p>The Clergy, that when the murderer of the Nicaraguan people, this cannot be forgotten, when that murderer, Anastasio Somoza, the murderer of Sandino, the betrayer, the traitor, who sold his country, put there by the Yankees, when he was executed by Rigoberto, then they buried him with the honors of Prince of the Church.... The devil was buried with the honors of Prince of the Church!</p>

<p>Myself, formed in Catholicism, and my very Catholic parents, we could neither understand nor accept a High Clergy that blessed, praised and exalted, to the Heavens, the tyrant who murdered the Nicaraguan People, and who never criticized the crimes, the thousands of crimes to which the Nicaraguan People were subjected. They never criticized the hunger and unemployment suffered by the Nicaraguan people. Never! They were at the service of tyranny, at the service of the tyranny imposed by the Yankees.</p>

<p>In August, precisely for the days of Pancasan, another flare up in 1978, on August 27, another flare up in the struggle for Justice, for Freedom in Nicaragua, the Insurrection of Matagalpa. There was an Insurrection in Matagalpa, Young People, boys, rose up there, with their bare chests giving battle, without fear of the rifles aimed at them, in the hands of the executioners of the Somocista tyranny.</p>

<p>Beloved Brothers and Sisters, Beloved Comrades, Beloved Nicaraguan Families, in this Sandinista Congress we salute the Team for Electoral Victory of the Department of Estelí, which proudly raises the example of our Beloved Brother Francisco Rivera Quintero "El Zorro", Hero of a thousand battles! Hero of a thousand battles! And I could affirm that, throughout the struggle, our Brother Francisco Rivera combined Popular Wisdom, the instinct of the Peasant, Courage, in the face of the greatest challenges, and Humility, Simplicity, Fraternity. A Hero of Fraternity, of Solidarity is our Brother Francisco Rivera "El Zorro", Comandante, who accompanies us, I am sure, in this Congress.</p>

<p>Likewise, we salute the Comrades of the Team for Electoral Victory of the Department of Madriz, "Colonel Santos López"; the Brothers of the Team for Electoral Victory "General Ramón Raudales", who like General Santos López, after the assassination of General Sandino, did not surrender and continued to fight the battle.</p>

<p>From the Department of Nueva Segovia we salute the Comrades of the Team for Electoral Victory "Miguel Angel Ortez". We also greet Miguel Angel's family, because Miguel Angel's daughter is there, she is already 90 years old, she has her birthday today or tomorrow, so we congratulate her.</p>

<p>To the Team for Electoral Victory of the First Free Territory of Nicaragua, where the Government Directorate was installed, the Department of Leon. There are 2 Teams there, the Team for Electoral Victory of our National Hero Rigoberto López Pérez. Rigoberto is one of those who said: "Who talks of fear, guys! Who talks of fear, guys!" And he gave his life, eliminating the hit man, the criminal that the Yankees had in place repressing the Nicaraguan people. That is what Rigoberto tells us with his Action, with his Poems, with his Words, with his Example. And the "René Núñez Téllez" Team, our Beloved Brother, Comrade, René, who was Secretary of the National Directorate of the Front, and later President of the National Assembly. To the Team for Electoral Victory of the Department of Chinandega. There we have two heroes, a brave and heroic comrade, the two committed sisters, they were two sisters committed in the struggle, in the battle, one of them was assassinated by the National Guard imposed by the Yankees, blessed by the clergy and applauded by the oligarchy, they never saw that human rights were violated there, our Beloved comrade María Pilar Gutiérrez, who also accompanies us together with Germán Pomares Ordoñez, "El Danto", a humble man, a brave man.</p>

<p>I would say that "El Danto" was the one who formed Rubén, "El Zorro"... Yes! In other words, the personalities of both of them, in their courage, in their humility, in their valor, in their love for the people. He was "El Danto" as the father, of course, older, and Ruben was a boy who joined his brother, with Filemon, who also fell in the struggle, Filemon Rivera, another youth we knew, and also with the same Virtues, with the same Qualities, with the same Values.</p>

<p>We salute the Brothers, Comrades, of the Team for Electoral Victory of the Department of Managua, of those Combatants, of the Combatant who never said, as Rugama explained it later and Rugama practiced it later: He never said he was dying for the Nation, he simply died. Julio Buitrago, Eternal Commander, ons his own, alone giving Battle and falling in combat.</p>

<p>To our Beloved Sandinista Brother and our younger Brother in the Family, who is taken up by the Team for Electoral Victory of the combative Department of Masaya, Camilo Ortega Saavedra... Camilo! Here is Camilo, here is Camilo with us... Camilo, very tall, he had the height of a basketball player, thin, and always with a smile, and very noble. There, when the Monimbó Insurrection took place, that is where Camilo fell.</p>

<p>To the Brothers and Sisters of the Electoral Team that bears the name of another Hero, of a Brother who developed extraordinary qualities to face persecution and in the midst of persecution and repression and death managed to sustain, in the most difficult moments, to sustain and organize the bases of the Sandinista Front in the Cities: Commander Pedro Arauz Palacios, known as "Federico", with the pseudonym of "Pedro".</p>

<p>We greet the brothers and sisters of the Team for Electoral Victory of the Department of Carazo, who honor us by carrying the flag of example, of decision, of firmness, of assuming the commitment of the struggle, at the risk of the loss of life, our dear brother and Teacher Ricardo Morales Aviles, an extraordinary hero, an intellectual, a teacher, with great nobility, and when the Front called on him to place himself in the front line of combat, he immediately took his place. And here, later in Nandaime, Ricardo, Oscar Turcios, Juan José, were captured, assassinated and tortured by the criminal Guard imposed by the Yankees.</p>

<p>Our greetings to the Brothers of the Department of Rivas who form the Team for Electoral Victory of that Brother who came from Asturias to live with the Peasants, to accompany the Peasants, to sing to the Peasants, to make the Peasants conscious, aware of the authentic Values of Christ. He did not come to transmit to them the hypocrisies, the false attitudes of those whom Christ called "the merchants of the Temple"; who disguised themselves as Priests, who had taken over the Temples and deceived the people, and behaved as if they were the Highest Moral Authority.</p>

<p>No...! He came with the Message of Christ, because the Message of Christ needs no intermediaries. God to communicate with the Peoples, with Families, with Adults, with Youth, neither God, nor Christ, need those Pharisees as intermediaries, they communicate directly, because God is for something, Christ is for something. They never said to go look for intermediaries to communicate with them, they never said that!</p>

<p>He who believes in God, loves God, he who believes in Christ and loves Christ seeks Christ directly, he does not need Pharisees, nor mobile phones, but speaks to him with his heart and Christ listens to him, and God listens to him. And that is, because he also accompanies us, our Brother Gaspar Garcia Laviana.</p>

<p>In the Department of Boaco, the Team for Electoral Victory bears the name of another of the founding comrades of the Sandinista Front, one of the first combatants with Carlos, another extraordinary brother and fighter, Modesto Duarte.</p>

<p>In the Department of Chontales the Team for Electoral Victory raises the Flag, raises the Values, raises the Commitment of Rigoberto Cruz (Pablo Úbeda), who fell in Pancasán.</p>

<p>In the Department of Río de San Juan the Team for Electoral Victory carries the Flag of the Heroes of October 13 who in that Heroic Deed gave their Lives, gave their Blood.</p>

<p>In the Department of Central Zelaya, in Nueva Guinea, El Coral, there the Team for Electoral Victory raises the Example and the Flag of another Peasant Brother, Member of the Sandinista Leadership in those Times of Battle, Jacinto Hernandez, whose Example was later, I would say, taken up again in the moments of the Final Offensive.</p>

<p>The Jacinto Hernandez Column with our Brother Oscar Benavides penetrated the Southern Zone of our country; the Column entered and the combats began, combat after combat, and the Army, trained and armed by the Yankees, let loose with everything it had on the Jacinto Hernandez Column. And there also went our Brother Ivan Montenegro, a very courageous comrade with an always joyful spirit. There Ivan also gave his blood.</p>

<p>From the Department of Central Zelaya, El Rama, Muelle de los Bueyes, there is the Team for Electoral Victory Ausberto Gutiérrez Ponce, another Combatant, another Hero who commits us even more to this Struggle.</p>

<p>In the Department of Matagalpa, in the area of Rancho Grande, El Tuma-La Dalia, Waslala, there is Bernardino Díaz Ochoa with the Team for Electoral Victory, a National Hero, Bernardino!</p>

<p>In the Department of Matagalpa also, in the area of Rio Blanco, Matiguás, Esquipulas, Muy Muy, there is the Team for Electoral Victory that bears the name of Pancasán Heroico... Always Pancasán Heroico!</p>

<p>In the Department of Matagalpa, in San Ramón, San Dionisio, there, to all honor, the Team for Electoral Victory Carlos Fonseca Amador, Comandante of the Sandinista Revolution.</p>

<p>Well, Matagalpa is a very big Department, after Managua it is Matagalpa, and after Matagalpa I think it is Leon and Chinandega; but after Managua it is Matagalpa. And in the Department of Matagalpa, covering San Isidro, Sébaco, Ciudad Darío, Terrabona, there is another Team for Electoral Combat, of Electoral Victory, which honorably carries, raises the Voice, the Example, the Tenacity, the Flag, the Firmness of our Beloved Brother Tomás Borge Martínez.</p>

<p>In the Department of Jinotega, in Wiwilí, El Cuá, Santa María de Pantasma, San José de Bocay, our Beloved Brothers who are the Team for Electoral Victory Unit there, bear the name of the Heroes and Martyrs of Raití and Bocay. Let us remember that this is where the first combats of the Sandinista Front took place, from El Patuca to Raití and Bocay. That is the reason for the song "Raití-Bocay".</p>

<p>In the Department of Jinotega the Team for Electoral Victory Unit that has the responsibility to fight this battle, and win this battle, in San Sebastián de Yalí, in La Concordia, in San Rafael del Norte, Jinotega, bears the name of that brother who was at the forefront of the struggle, and gave his life, and in the leadership of the Front, Jacinto Hernández.</p>

<p>In the Department of the Mining District, we are talking about the area of Las Minas, Siuna, Bonanza, Rosita, Mulukukú, there the Team for Electoral Victory carries the Flag of the Heroes of La Rampla, where they fought and resisted, and did not allow the mercenaries sent by the Yankees to take control, as they intended, that Mining District.</p>

<p>In the North Caribbean Coast Region, the Team for Electoral Victory Unit bears the name of a Heroine Comrade, with great honor, Women present in Combat, Nidia White Reyes.</p>

<p>In the South Caribbean Coast Region, the Team for Electoral Victory Unit carries the Flag, raises the Flag of the Example of Neysi Ríos Olivares.</p>

<p>There are 27 Teams for Electoral Victory. And from this Congress of the Sandinista Front we greet all the Nicaraguan People, we greet all the Nicaraguan Families, including those who do not have a great commitment to the Front, but who recognize the work done by the Sandinista Government, to them we send our Greetings.</p>

<p>To those who are not militants of the Front, who are in other political parties, well, they have their reasons, and we respect them, as long as, being good Nicaraguans, they are not instruments of the Filibusters, they are not instruments of the Yankee Empire. Because Nicaraguans, in order to call ourselves Nicaraguans and feel Nicaraguans, with all pride, regardless of the differences we have, we have to resolve those differences as Nicaraguans, among Nicaraguans, and peacefully.</p>

<p>And we have a powerful instrument to do so, which are the Elections, a powerful instrument that we managed to make work in the service of the Nicaraguan People, as a result of the Triumph of the Popular Sandinista Revolution in 1979. A powerful instrument to such an extent that it was made to work even in the midst of the war, in the 80's, we went to Elections, the first Free Elections.</p>

<p>Then we went in the 90's to Elections, and the first peaceful transfer of Government in the History of Nicaragua took place. And then came other Elections. And then still more elections. That is to say, 3 National Elections, also accompanied by Municipal Elections, and also accompanied by Regional Elections, because for the first time in the History of Nicaragua the Original Peoples had their Rights recognized.</p>

<p>That could only be done via the Revolution...! To recognize the Rights, their Values, their Culture, their Lands, of the Original Peoples of the Caribbean Region of Nicaragua, of the Autonomous Region of the Northern Caribbean and the Autonomous Region of the Southern Caribbean. The Greater Caribbean in Nicaragua, which thanks to the Revolution achieved the status of Autonomy for all that immense Region. And this Autonomy status not only gives them the right to be owners of what historically belongs to them, which are the lands, the waters, all that Natural Environment in which they grew and developed, and were on the verge of being exterminated by Imperialism and by the Governments at the service of Imperialism.</p>

<p>Today they are Autonomous Regions that have their own Assembly, their own Congress, one in the North, another in the South, and they have their own Elections as well.</p>

<p>So, look at how many elections, from 1984 to date, how many elections have been held in our country, how many national elections, how many elections to the Central American Parliament, how many municipal elections, how many elections in the Northern and Southern Caribbean Regions!</p>

<p>In other words, Democracy has been put into practice here, Democracy put into practice by the Will and Decision of the Nicaraguans, but there have always been those who Sandino called "Imperialists of the Earth", who have always wanted to come and dominate Nicaragua; we already know where the Imperialists of the Earth come from.</p>

<p>Some, today, in these historical circumstances, well, now they are more powerful than their country of origin; that is, when they left their country to invade the lands of Our America, England, for example, was a much greater power, because the United States simply did not exist, because the United States belonged to the Native Peoples, to the North American Indians.... The United States belonged to them! They were the owners of those lands, of those waters, of those mountains, of those canyons, of those rivers, of those lakes.</p>

<p>Ah, but that's where the English came to murder! The same as they came from Europe, from that Europe that was fighting, not for Peace, but for World domination; the Europeans were fighting for World domination, they were killing each other to dominate the World, among themselves, and of course, the United States did not exist, meanwhile they were killing each other.</p>

<p>They provoked wars that affected all of Europe with thousands of dead, millions of dead in all Europe, killing each other; that is to say, the European Peoples were subjected to wars for the ambition of the owners of great capital that trafficked in slaves, that did business of all kinds and wanted to take over all Europe, and from Europe to take over Asia, Africa and all the known World.</p>

<p>In other words, it is the clearest expression of what ambition is, the capitalist ambition that tramples on the Lives of millions of Human Beings trying to accumulate wealth. Because that is what they want, to accumulate wealth and every day to accumulate more wealth and to have control of the World, for what? To accumulate even more wealth.</p>

<p>And I was telling you how, then the United States, already occupied by the emigrants who arrived first in that famous ship, the Mayflower, and the migrations that continued coming from Europe, and the persecution that they launched against the Indigenous Peoples in the United States, exterminating them to take over their lands, and coming from a much more developed Society, logically they managed to grow and ended up confronting the English Empire.</p>

<p>In other words, the interests that they were creating there, just as in Canada after exterminating the Indians, then they also began to confront the French Empire, and also the English Empire, they entered into all those contradictions.</p>

<p>And well, as I was saying, finally the great Power that is the United States of America was installed in the United States.</p>

<p>And Europe, which today is a Community of Nations that is subjected to the American Power, to such an extent that they form a single Military Unit in NATO, and when it comes to attacking a Free Country in Africa, as they did with Libya, NATO goes there; that is to say, the Europeans go with the gringos to bomb a People to enslave them after that People had been a Free People.</p>

<p>Or when a battle was being fought in our Region, because a Power like England took possession of the Malvinas by force, then they get together, they work together, because they have only one interest: the interest of domination. They share the same concepts and that is why we see them acting constantly against those Peoples who fight for their Self-Determination, for their Independence; while they repress their own Peoples, there in their own Countries.</p>

<p>The American People are repressed, the European Peoples are repressed, the Human Rights of the European Peoples, of the American People, are violated. How many Human Rights are violated! How many murders every day, of Children, of Adults, in the United States, and how many horrendous crimes in the United States, in Canada, against the Peoples! And every day more horrors are discovered, more brutal acts, committed in the name of Democracy, committed in the name of Liberty, committed in the name of the defense of Human Rights... So many terrible crimes!</p>

<p>That is why I say to my Nicaraguan brothers and sisters that we are indeed brothers and sisters, and we will be brothers and sisters, as long as we are a family and we really are a family. That suddenly we may not understand each other, that we disagree, that is normal, but that someone from the Family goes out to look for the Yankee, or to look for the European, to come and attack his own Family here in his Land, to come and put to the sword his Family here in his Land, to come and set a yoke on his Family here in his Land, ah no, from that moment on they stop being Nicaraguan and becomes a seller of their own country. They do not deserve any respect whatsoever! They are traitors to their Family, traitors to their Nation, that is what they are, traitors to their Family and traitors to their Nation!</p>

<p>So, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, we have to continue defending our right to build the country, to develop the country, reaching agreement, respecting our Institutions, and, well, you can see the result, we all see it: Education, Health Care, Streets, Highways, Drinking Water, Energy.... All that has been achieved in this country, but there are always those who try to stop this development and this progress. Because bringing water to a community, bringing energy to a community, bringing a road to a community, bringing a school, bringing a health post, bringing a hospital, that is bringing human rights to Nicaraguan families.</p>

<p>And that is what we have been doing and defending, and we have done it in the most rational, most peaceful, most intelligent way, creating a great National Alliance, a great National Agreement like the one we even have expressed in the Constitution, we incorporated it into the Constitution, that great National Alliance, which is to develop the Economy, which is to fight Poverty, while each one has their political Party. But, in spite of all the benefits it has brought to all the Economic and Social Sectors, this was threatened; they tried to destroy it and take away, therefore, the People's the Rights that were being defended.</p>

<p>But we managed to defeat that terrorist aggression that violated the Human Rights of the Nicaraguan people, and we continue to press forward, and we are going to new Elections. And because we are making the Way as we Go, we can say, as Don Quixote said to Sancho, when they were riding, and the dogs were howling, and so too now, the dogs are howling, Nicaraguan brothers and sisters. Of course they are howling! And why are they howling? Because we are making our way ahead, and that is where Don Quixote said to Sancho: Let them howl, because that means we are making our way! Let them howl, Sancho, because we are making our way ahead!</p>

<p>If they did not howl, if they came to embrace and praise us, that would mean the People would have already been betrayed, and that, therefore, the Fight Against Poverty would be over and the rationale  "every man for himself" of Savage Capitalism would be installed.</p>

<p>This "every man for himself" of Savage Capitalism can never again be installed in our Country, because it is our People who are owners of their Destiny and that is what we will continue to defend, we will continue to defend it with all Firmness and with a great Spirit of Solidarity and Love for our Neighbor as dictated by Christ Our Lord, as commanded by God!</p>

<p>Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, we are already just a few months away from the Elections, from August to October, 97 days, we are talking about 3 months, plus the few days up until November 7th. Fidel handles the mathematics very well, and we do have to handle mathematics well, why? So that we can continue building everything that is owed to the People, because that is a historical debt that the pro-Yankee governments had with the Nicaraguan People: an Illiterate People, a hungry People, a People without Schools, a People without Hospitals, without Energy, without Electricity, without Water, without Streets, without Highways. It was a People whose Human Rights were being violated, and the Revolution came to rescue the Human Rights of the Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p>And together, Dear Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters, we will continue to fight this battle, in Peace, because we are lovers of Peace, we are enemies of confrontation and war. But that does not mean that we are going to allow ourselves to be attacked, to be murdered, to be tortured, to be set on fire? No, we will not allow that! Because it is true, we are lovers of Peace and we defend Peace at the cost of our own Lives, but in the face of crimes, in the face of terrorism, fed by the Yankee Empire and practiced by their collaborators, make no mistake about it.</p>

<p>That because we are acting prudently, because we want to seek the return of Peace and calm, that this may lead some to think, as it sometimes has led them to think, that we must leave now, that the time has come for us to leave Government. No, don't make that mistake!</p>

<p>We are forged with the spirit of Diriangén, yes, with the spirit of Diriangén, with the spirit of Nicarao, with the spirit of our Caciques who resisted, confronted and gave their lives fighting against the European invaders. We are forged with the mettle of the Heroes of San Jacinto, with the mettle of Zeledón, of Sandino, of Carlos, of all the Heroes and Martyrs. We are forged with the extraordinary mettle of Rigoberto López Pérez, who put it clearly, when he was by himself: Who said fear, guys Who said fear, guys!</p>

<p>To work in Peace together, is what we propose, that is the challenge we present to the Political Forces that are going to participate in the Elections, and that is the call we make to those who still maintain destructive plans of assassinations, of terror. Get that out of your heads, and come and assume your role as true Nicaraguans.</p>

<p>Be Nicaraguans, and then together, all together, we will continue building for Peace, building to eradicate Poverty, building so that the country's Youth can be forged with greater knowledge; building so that we can address all the diseases that kill people quickly when they live in Poverty and there are no Hospitals at hand to serve them.</p>

<p>Yes, to defend Peace, to defend Human Rights, which is to defend Democracy with the People and for the People, that is our Commitment, Beloved Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters! Long live Blessed and Forever Free Nicaragua!</p>
