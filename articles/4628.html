July 15th 2024</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Address by Daniel</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Beloved Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters; Beloved Families; Brothers and Sisters in Transportation; Compañera Rosario, Vice President of the Republic;</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Brother Chen Xi, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China in Nicaragua; compañero Laureano Ortega, Special Representative of the Government for China; compañero Santi Zhou Qing, Representative of the YUTONG Company; compañero Fidel Moreno, Secretary of the Mayor's Office of Managua. Fidel is all terrain, he is heavy duty transport; compañero Amaru Ramírez, Deputy Minister of Transport; compañero Daniel Sánchez, President of URECOOTRACO; compañero Aura Lila Rodríguez, Director of the Pioneers Cooperative; compañero Alcides Ponce Navarro, President of the Democratic Union Cooperative.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Today we are delivering these buses so that they contribute to the transportation of families, of children going to school, of young people going to school, going to university; of workers, women, doctors, teachers, of all sectors of Nicaraguan Society, who use collective Ttransport as their means of transport.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Today, July 15th, is the day our Brother Julio Buitrago, a young man, fell in combat. Julio was in college but went on to combat with the Sandinista Front, and the feat, the heroism, of Julio, who fell in combat 55 years ago today, on July 15th 1969, is well known. He was alone! He was surrounded by 300 National Guard, trained by the Yankees, they brought small tanks, they brought airplanes, and he resisted until his last cartridge. And there Julio took flight to another Plane of Life, filling Nicaragua's Youth with more vigor, greater Glory and greater Combativeness.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And in tribute to Julio we make this handover on this day, in tribute to Julio who represents Nicaragua's Youth, giving their lives for Nicaragua, fighting for Nicaragua.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Also today we have sent from the Presidency to the National Assembly, such that tomorrow the Assembly will approve that Nicaragua's Youth is Patrimony of this Patriotic Nation, all Youth, with no distinctions of any kind. All youth are the Patrimony of this Patriotic Nation.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">As our Brother, Ambassador Chen Xi, well noted, our relations with China are historic, Ambassador Chen Xi recalled the years of the Triumph of China's Revolution, and they will be commemorating now 75 and us 45. What does this mean? That it took 30 years for the Triumph of the Sandinista Revolution to follow on, and before the Triumph of the Nicaraguan Revolution was the Triumph of the Cuban Revolution, which was immediately intertwined with the People's Republic of China, when the Great Chairman Mao Tse-Tung was at the head of the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">When we were fighting, from the 1960s onwards, against the tyranny of Somoza, we maintained links with the leaders of the Chinese Party; compañeras and compañeros of the Sandinista Front traveled there, to China, in those years. And naturally we were inspired by the Chinese Revolution, a Revolution that had an impact on the world, with such an immense territory and with a division in the country, and the ability that the Chinese Leadership, headed by Mao, displayed in uniting that Great Nation, where there were a great many differences between the provinces. They had to be united, and he united them.</p>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="230" src="http://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/394241.jpeg" width="430" /></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Then the Chinese Revolution came to grow, it came to advance, facing counter-revolutions, and later the Chinese People's Revolution managed to take a great leap forward, such that now, with President Xi Jinping, much wider doors are opening for humanity.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And he has expressed it very clearly: How can we make the World into a World of Peace, a World of Complementarity, a World where we help each other, where Great Powers do not use their might to impose themselves and to exploit Peoples.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And China has been fulfilling its Principles, which are Revolutionary Principles, they are the Principles of the Chinese Communist Party, with which we have always maintained relations. Tomás was there, in China, in various seminars held there in China in which leaders of the revolutionary parties of Central America took part, Victor Tirado had also been there before.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And China today, is really serving as a compass, pointing the Way which other Nations share as well, that Planet Earth cannot continue to live under the boot of Empires which accumulate wealth at the expense of Developing Peoples, crushing them, invading them, murdering them. This has to change, and it will surely have to change, because every day we find more countries defending these positions.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And we have seen the presentation of these demonstrations of Nicaraguan Culture and Art, which have their roots in the Original Peoples, our Ancestors.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We have seen and congratulate the dancers of "El Solar de Monimbó", of the Macehuatl Folk Ballet, under the direction and choreography of Maestro René Jaime. An embrace for Brother René Jaime, and for Alejandro too, of course, there, sharing.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We have also seen there the artistic presentations from the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, from the North, because there are as many kinds as there are many communities in the Caribbean, and today these communities are Autonomous, they have an Autonomous Government, and their Authorities own their lands, which were handed over to them by the Revolution.<br />
 </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And we have seen at the end that Dance, Sirpiki Mairin, which means “Beautiful Woman” in Miskito, from the Macehuatl Ballet, with the choreography and under the direction of Maestro René Jaime, and also of Alejandro Cuadra.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So, congratulations to the dancers and to the directors of these wonderful dances.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I was commenting here to Fidel, because there are now 1,000 buses, just imagine, 1,000 buses in record time, and this year 1,000 more are coming. And I was telling Fidel to see to it with the Transport compañeros, that we guarantee some buses for the Caribbean Coast, so that they reach Bluefields and reach Bilwi, so that they reach the Mines Region; that is, that the embrace of Solidarity from the Chinese People reaches the Miskito Peoples, the Ramas, the Afro-descendant population, the Mayagna, the Garifuna.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">May this embrace of Solidarity from the Chinese People reach all these communities, because now the highways are there, and the highways are still advancing. So there should be no problem now for these buses to circulate on the Caribbean Coast.<br />
 </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And I was telling you that, later we will have the dance of the “Managua's Fiestas and Sones de Toros”, which is a presentation of young students from the Culture Centers of Managua. With choreography and direction by Maestro Elvin Vanegas. So, go ahead, Managua!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We congratulate the dance students of the local neighborhood dance schools, they are forming themselves there and for giving thanks to the Ambassador's greeting and to the 45th Anniversary.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I mentioned the Sandinista Brothers and Sisters who visited China at the time of the war here, when we were at war and we had not yet triumphed. Already in the 1980s we had the honor of visiting the People's Republic of China, we were there with Rosario and with a very large delegation, Father d'Escoto, a large Delegation, and there we managed to meet as the Brothers and Sisters that we are.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Well, in the 1990s the neoliberal politicians imposed by the Gringos came along, and the first thing they did was break off relations with the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Then we had to be patient, patient above all, to fight the battle by governing from below, during three neoliberal governments. Three Neoliberal governments passed, and we fought the battle from below. And we fought for the Transport sectors, we fought that battle in the streets, with the workers defending their businesses and with the peasants defending the land, and in defense of the 6% for the Universities, for free education, because everything was being privatized.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We returned to Government, always in communication with the People's Republic of China, looking for the moment when we could normalize relations again. We have been united in our struggles, in the battles that the Chinese people have been waging to improve their conditions, to strengthen themselves in all fields, to stand in solidarity with the Peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, with the Peoples of the World.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">China is an extraordinary example of what a Great Power can be by engaging respectfully with small nations in all these Regions that I have mentioned to you. Undoubtedly, the prestige of the People's Republic of China under President Xi Jinping is a prestige that has managed to settle across the planet, and in the BRICS they form a very important group that is a brake on imperialist policies, the policies of invasion, of sanctions. It is a brake, and thus the New World is being shaped, the New World that will bring Peace and Happiness to Humanity.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I have every faith in God, in Christ, that Peace will reign on Planet Earth, even if the Imperialists of the Earth try to prevent it.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Long live Nicaragua, Blessed and Forever Free!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Long Live Nicaragua, Christian, Socialist and in Solidarity!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Long live the Chinese people!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Long live President Xi Jinping!<br />

<p><b>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><b>after the handover of new buses to Managua's Transport Cooperatives</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
<b>July 15th 2024</b></p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Thank you very much. A very good evening. A History of Victories...!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I was talking to the Transport compañeras and compañeros, and saying to them: How we have defended these Victories... With our Soul, with our Heart, and above all with Faith, with Great Hope and Trust in God. And God has given us the Strength, the Fortitude, to Overcome, always combative, always given over to Patriotic Love, and that Strength, that Infinite Strength is what builds all Victories. Yesterday's Memorable Victories!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Julio Buitrago, is an example of what we Nicaraguans are, a Great Example, an Example that is in each of us. It is not just photos that we are looking at... It is the very Nicaraguan Soul that manifests itself in Julio!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In July, Julio was born... Victorious July! And July is all of us, Julio Buitrago is All of Us, for we know what we are, what we will be, that We overcome, and that we will overcome!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's why, when one sees the non-entities talking, spouting their nonsense, everyone knows they are nothing, nobodies, not even burnt-out remnants... They are nothing! They simply are. They really are null and void, in terms of the Nicaraguan People's great history of Bravery, of Courage. That Story makes us feel very much blessed, first of all, and also so very proud of being who we are, and of our Strength of Spirit.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">It is this Strength that God gives us which leads us to wake up each day invoking Him, to strengthen our capacity to Work, in Unity, in Union, and in understanding how it is that in Union, in Unity, in Concord, as Brothers and Sisters, as a Nicaraguan Family, we are Going Onward.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Progress...! Our Future is made of Progress, of Prosperity, of Infinite Joy. Of days to celebrate our Nicaraguan courage... 45/19, Nicaraguan courage! A history of Victories...!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I always say to myself, emotionally, because I am moved by all the Remembrances and I am also moved by all the Memory... Remembrances and Memory! Memory in terms of the Historical Times that we have had to know and live through. We are privileged!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">I get emotional, and say to myself: How much we have been able to do, and therefore, how much we can do now! Because this People of ours, all of us, these Sacred Lands that have given us miracles and portents: Rubén Darío, a miracle in this country; General Benjamín Zeledón; our Original Peoples; Nicarao, Diriangén, Adiact; and General Zeledón, as we say too, our General of Free Men and Women... How many Treasures! How much Heritage!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And today that our Comandante Daniel has sent to the National Assembly the Decree of National Patrimony for Nicaragua's Youth of All Times, we know it is that Vigor, that Glory, that Courage, that Valor, which assures us of all the Victories that are coming. The Victories of the Future! Always trusting in God, and always knowing that while we propose, God disposes.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That is why we also know that we listen, feel, vibrate to and are attentive to God's Will. We can plan to go this way, but we also understand those messages of Providence that tells us: No, over there! And that means, to always be aware, in the midst of all the brawling, the scrapping in the street, the ruckus I call it, of the usual delinquents, knowing that none of it matters, nor makes any difference in terms of Historic Times.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">What counts is the Wisdom we have had, and that we have now, to listen to the Voice of God, and to be ready to work, to make our way, to advance, All Together. And this is the call that we always make, one we always give: It is All Together that We Go Onward. And of course, by the Hand of God, as we never tire of saying, by the Hand of God, praising Him, invoking Him, and recognizing His Great Power over this Blessed Nicaragua, Sovereign and Proud, Forever Dignified and Free.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Warm embraces to all Nicaragua's Families, in these days when we celebrate the Triumphs that God has given us based on Our Courage and Character; in these days when we celebrate ourselves as a Nicaraguan People, which knows of Struggles and Honor; in these days when we celebrate ourselves with Infinite Love, Love for Nicaragua, Love between Ourselves, the Love that Creates. Because hatred destroys. Love creates. And We are creating the future we deserve.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Warm embraces to everyone. Thank you, Compañeras and Compañeros. Thank you.</p>
