Grigsby is a Nicaraguan journalist, former editor in chief of El Nuevo
Diario and Barricada, Director of Radio La Primerísima and of, among
many others, the popular analysis program Sin Fronteras. What is more
Grigsby is a dedicated revolutionary: student leader in the 1970s,
militant of the FSLN since 1978, founder of the left faction of the
FSLN in 1994 and member of its central committee - the Sandinista
Assembly.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In
the course of a recent visit by Grigsby to Sweden, journalist Jorge
Capelán interviewed him in Stockholm. The upcoming celebrations of the
30th anniversary of the Popular Sandinista Revolution, 47 years since
the FSLN was founded and 81 years since Augusto C. Sandino took up arms
are just a few weeks away. Capelán's interview captures the opinion of
one of Nicaragua's sharpest political analysts on why the European left
is so critical of the FSLN. It also covers Grigsby's views on the
FSLN's recent historical development and perspectives for the future.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *<br></div><br>Jorge
Capelán: Nicaragua and the FSLN are a complicated issue for the
European left, an issue about which little is written, especially in a
positive light. What do you believe to be the European left's main
difficulties in understanding Nicaragua's political development?<br><br>William
Grigsby: The left, the European and the northern hemisphere's left in
general, have been unable to come to terms with the FSLN defeat in
1990. This left is still trapped in those times and in that decade.
Twenty years later they would like everything to go back to how it was
then. They would like to imagine that the last twenty years were
nothing more than a nightmare.<br><br>But the truth is that twenty
years have passed and Nicaragua has changed very much - generally those
changes have been negative - as has the entire world - also in negative
ways. You can't analyze the situation in Nicaragua with the same prism
as you did in the 80s. There are qualititive differences.<br><br>The
first, I believe, and this is probably where the universal left gets
most bogged down, is at the subjective level. 60% of Nicaragua's
population today wasn't alive during the revolution. 75% of the
population wasn't alive during the Somoza dictatorship. For the vast
majority of the Nicaraguan population the Sandinista Revolution and the
Somoza dictatorship are a reference, and a distant one at that. What is
more, the population tends to be ignorant or have a deformed
understanding of what happened in the country at that time.<br><br>Neo-liberalism has provoked increasing apathy in Nicaraguan society<br><br>On
top of this, we must remember that neo-liberalism is not just a form of
capitalism that pillages the world peoples through concealed
neocolonialism. Neo-liberalism is also an ideological system that
perverts citizens turning them into nothing more than consumers - and
not just consumers of merchandise, but of the messages put out by mass
media outlets, absorving like a sponge ideological contents, forms of
behaviour and interaction, they chain you to indivuality, to isolation
and to heartless competition with your equals. And in some way, theory
becomes a practical reality.<br><br>Nowadays you'll find the immense
majority of the Nicaraguan people, despite being impoverished,
subjected to regimes of semi slavery, isn't particularly involved in
social organizations that aim to confront the system and fight for
their rights. The daily struggle is more about satisfying individuals
needs that collective needs, or the needs of the country.<br><br>Neo-liberalism
has been very successful in taking away citizens' right to political
participation within the logic that politics and politicians are
corrupt. These ideas have penetrated the new generations in such a way
that, for many people, finding a way to leave Nicaragua has become the
most important thing - they aim to sort out their basic needs, without
the need for greater sacrifices, even though it means enslaving
themselves. Thirty years ago almost 100% of Nicaraguan young people
took up arms, went out on the street and contributed to the overthrow
of the dictatorship.<br><br>We have to begin from our reality in order to build a new reality<br><br>JC:
From outside Nicaragua a number of commentators criticize different
aspects including the FSLN's tactics or the limitations of its current
program...<br><br>WG: I think the European left is wrong in its
political analysis, in its analysis of the political moment and the
correlation of forces that exist in Nicaragua at the moment. We have to
begin from the reality that we have in order to be able to build the
new reality. That reality is made up not only of whether or not there
are machines, land and resources but also of human beings, the majority
of whom have been impoversished, trapped in ignorance, and now have few
revolutionary values because they have been individualized. That is the
reality that we have to begin working from. <br><br>I may or may not
have my reserves about the way the FSLN exercized its quotas of power
before it came to government. But there is an undisputable fact:
whether one likes it or not, the FSLN is in power and has a leadership,
personalized in the figure of President Ortega, that during the last 19
years demonstrated consistency with the essence of the Nicaraguan
people's struggle.<br><br>There have been highs and lows, like with all
political leadership, mistakes have been made, sometimes very grave
mistakes, but the most important thing is that [the FSLN is in power].
The government's actions during the last two and a half years are not
aimed aimed at carrying forward a political project similar that of the
1980s but one aimed at [resolving the problems present in] the reality
of Nicaragua today.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Today the priority is not the
conquest of democractic rights (which we already have), it is not the
construction a new state (which, although warped by neo-liberalism, we
already have), it is not the construction of an army or a police force.
The priority today is the hunger suffered by the population, hunger in
all senses; hunger for food, for healthcare, for knowledge, etc. If
this is your priority and you have a precarious correlation of forces
on a parliamentary level and on a social level, then you have to start
to attend to that priority starting from the established order of
things in the country.<br><br>It is very easy, when you aren't hungry,
to say to the government that it is acting in an assistential manner
giving small farmers the food production package. I have made this
argument many times. In itself a discourse about rule of law, freedom
of speech, citizen participation and awareness is fine. But it's easy
to talk about these things when you, your family and your friends have
three meals a day guaranteed. So the issue comes down to class
difference - those who have their basic needs guaranteed don't feel
comfortable about the way President Ortega is sorting out the basic
needs of the impoverished people.<br><br>Hundreds of thousands of
emigrants have been expulsed from Nicaragua by the system. What is more
terrible for a human being than the conditions in your country forcing
you to leave just in order to survive. I think that for the vast
majority of Nicaraguans that left over the last few years it has been a
painful process, even though many of them today, have been able to
ensure their basic needs are met....<br><br>God became the only refuge during 16 long years <br><br>Another
issue is the religious rhetoric. I didn't understand this religiousity
in the FSLN's official discourse until a few years ago. A friend Toni
Solo explained it to me. Very simply, he said, "the thing is that
during all these years people have felt very alone: poor, hungry and
alone. And the only thing they could take refuge in was God. Some
religious group comes along and says that you must be calm, patient,
that you must resign yourself, that if you behave in a virtuos way then
things will get better, that it is by praying and praying and praying
that you can overcome disease, because in the hospitals there were no
doctors or medicines that could cure you, so perhaps, you think, such
and such a saint will bless you with a little miracle..."<br><br>For
those whose basic needs are met, that attitude is a sign of ignorance,
of backwardness, etc. But for those who have been in the situation that
the people of Nicaragua have been in, then it is much more complex -
you are in a situation where there is no solution, you don't know what
to do, you are desperate and so you clutch at the divine figure of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Sociological studies done in Nicaragua
have found that for 96% of Nicaraguans the most important thing in
their lives is God. On occassion one bumps into fellow militants from
the struggle of the 70s and 80s who today have turned into religious
fanatics. When you start to talk to them about their personal history
then you'll be told about the most terrible tragedies.<br><br>Europeans
may think that is ideological weakness. It may be, but you'd have to
put yourself in the shoes of the person. I haven't been in those shoes.
I used to be very drastic in my judgement of former militants turned
religious fanatics. ...<br><br>The ideological dispute over the administration of divine power<br><br>But
the truth is that in order to be able to communicate with an
impoverished people you must, among other things, speak to them about
this figure called God. You can't communicate with them if you don't
talk their own language. That doesn't justify that sometimes President
Ortega and also Rosario Murillo have gone too far. But today, thirty
months after coming to power, that rhetorical content has become more
moderate and, in my opinion, is used in an appropriate fashion.<br><br>In
fact at present one of the principal ideological disputes is taking
place around the subject of God in Nicaraguan society. The Catholic
Church had had full possession of the idea of God, not just as a
superior being, but also as a symbol and representative of power, as
administrators of that power. So when Ortega and Rosario come along and
say "to fulfill the people's need is to fulfill God's mandate"&nbsp; -
they are disputing with the Catholic Church on its own turf the issue
of who administers divine power? Does the eclesiastical hierarchy
administer it, or do we all administer it?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>This is
a bitter dispute, and it's existence helps to explain some of the
Catholic Church's recent harsh criticisms of the government. I'm not
saying that we should all become theologians, it's not that, but we are
obliged to begin from the reality that exists in order to find ways of
transforming it. I think that the Europeans, and populations from the
northern hemisphere in general haven't understood this form of finding
solutions to Nicaragua's problems.&nbsp; <br><br>The struggle for national liberation: a historical process<br><br>JC:
For many people the revolution of 1979 was a lost revolution. You
mentioned democracy, the non Somocista State and a sovereign army. Were
those results of the revolution?<br><br>WG: The Popular Sandinista
Revolution is just one phase of Nicaragua's process of national
liberation that began with Sandino and even before, with Benjamin
Zeledon who rebelled when the Yankees invaded the country after having
propitiating General Jose Santos Zelaya's resignation. Benjamin Zeledon
was killed in combat in 1912. I believe that his death marks the
beginning of the struggle for national liberation in Nicaragua. We're
talking about nearly a hundred years ago. It's a struggle that has had
its highs and lows, following the form of a curve, like all of
humanity's history, it moves in waves.<br><br>So, we have the struggle
of Zeledon, who is defeated, all the indigenous people that supported
him were murdered. The Yankees stay a few years, they come and go. Then
Augusto Cesar Sandino appears on the scene to retake the cause of
national liberation.<br><br>There is a very interesting phrase by
Sandino that explains why he and Farabundo Martí parted ways. [Martí -
the Salvadoran communist leader of an anti imperialist guerilla
movement in El Salvador.] His first explanations were very resentful,
but later he provided a more measured explanation: "I agreed with
everything that Farabundo said," said Sandino, "but now is not the
time."<br><br>For Sandino, a political animal although he wasn't able
to finish secondary school, what inspired him was to rid the country of
gringo soldiers, to achieve independence and national sovereignty. "The
rest will come later," he said. That ideology corresponded with the
conciousness of his own army and with his own empiric analysis of the
correlation of forces in the country at the
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>When Sandino arrived
in Managua for the first time after the Yankees had left Nicaragua, in
February 1933, Sandino was received as a hero by the population in
Managua, although that was cleverly concealed by the main media outlets
of the time. The way in which Sandino was received demonstrated the
extent to which the cause of national independence had moved the
Nicaraguan people.<br><br>It was the big conservative media outlets
that first understood the need to get rid of Sandino. They understood
that the enthusiasm the population felt for Sandino's struggle could
turn into something else. Secretly, during the conciliatory meetings
between conservatives and liberals in the national palace, the
conditions were created within which Somoza finally ordered Sandino's
execution.<br><br>A huge parenthesis is opened after Sandino's
assasination that doesn't end until 1956 when Rigoberto López Pérez
assasinated Somoza. That period of twenty two years was dominated by a
sense of absolute hopelessness. After Luis Somoza García was killed a
new phase begins, the highpoint of which is the founding of the FSLN in
1961. That phase ends in 1979 and consisted of highs and lows, because
remember there was Pancasán [one of the bloodiest battles during the
insurrectional process], there were the divisions of 1970 and 1974.<br><br>The triumph of 1979 and the conquest of a nationalist state<br><br>At
the end of that phase, with the triumph of the revolution on the 19th
of July 1979, the FSLN had three big tasks - to conquer democratic and
other liberties, to resolve the contradiction of a "sovereign" republic
dominated by the United States, and to overcome the poverty affecting
the population.<br><br>The FSLN undertook those three tasks. But
between 1990 and 2007 when Ortega assumed the presidency again, the
only one that remained intact was the conquest of liberties, including
the founding of the new State with its army and police force, the
institutional scaffolding and the feeling of belonging to a nation -
which had been constituted to a certain extent in previous decades but
which was affirmed in the decade of the 1980s.<br><br>That sense of the
Nicaraguan nation may seem insignificant in "marxist-leninist" terms,
but in a country as politically and culturally backward as Nicaragua
its significance was of great magnitude. First you have to have an
identity before you know what it is that you have to do. <br>&nbsp;<br>But
the other two achievements [poverty reduction and realization of
sovereignty] had been undone. Nicaragua had conquered its independence
from the US, but the capitalist governments that governed between 1990
and 2006 renounced it voluntarily. In political and economic terms they
handed over the country to US and European interests.<br><br>JC: But they couldn't control the army and the police ...<br><br>WG:
... among other things, thanks to the resistence in that period: Those
who really defended FSLN interests in the first half of the 1990s were
the labour unions. The party structure of the FSLN was still
disorientated at that time. The FSLN's pyramidal structure, similar to
that of traditional left wing party structure, was overwhelmed.<br><br>Industrial
and rural workers and farmers, Sandinistas or not, came out and
defended the FSLN. In those hard years, Daniel was the member of the
historical leadership that was seen at the front of that movement. It
was there that Daniel gained authority within sandinismo, which in part
explains his leadership. It was then, and not in the 80s that Daniel
earned his authority. It is that correlation of forces, so bitterly
fought over in the 1990s, that pacifies the right and makes them think
twice about taking on the army.<br><br>Without the 2006 FSLN victory our public security forces would have become capitalist forces of repression<br><br>They
did try though, they carried out important counter-reforms. The easiest
way to destroy an institution is by corrupting it, with special
individual benefits - scholarships, courses. Or, for example, by not
providing the police force with resources so that the institution is
forced to look to the private sector for necessary resources. Until
2006 the so-called "Association of Friends of the Police" existed in
all the different departments of the country with that aim. The
Nicaraguan police had been semi-privatized. The right wing didn't do it
juridically, or politically. They found another way to do
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If the FSLN hadn't won the elections in 2006
that privatization process would have ended with the creation of a
completely corrupt police force, because by then there were grave
problems [within the institution.] I think there still are, although
the problem is not as bad as two or three years ago. If the FSLN hadn't
won we would be in a terrible situation, with a police force
increasingly hostile to the people, and increasingly similar to police
forces in other parts of the continent - capitalist police forces.<br><br>Exactly
the same thing would have happened with the army, although the army is
less visible, there is less day to day contact with the population -
the soldiers are enclosed in their quartels. But there was significant
penetration of the US intelligence services and the South Commandment
in the different levels of army's structure, in the military training,
in terms of contents and prebends. <br><br>And, unfortunately, there
are still remnants of that today. For example, the agreement signed
with the South Commandment by which the Nicaraguan Army sends a number
of soldiers for training to the School of the Americas each year - that
agreement is still in force.<br><br>So, you are talking about a process
of national liberation of which only the political liberties that I
have spoken about survived, of which the capitalist governments handed
over sovereignty to the US and the European governments, and in which
people's living conditions were not just bad, but worse than ever. So
the FSLN government finds itself with two basic tasks; to restore
national independence and sovereignty and to drastically improve
people's living conditions.<br><br>The European left forgets that socialism can't be decreed<br><br>JC: In other words that the tasks of "socializing" the economy, etc, are tasks that have to be taken up in the future ...<br><br>WG:
The thing is that our European friends often forget that socialism
can't be imposed by decree, it takes more than just political will.
Among other things, the development of productive forces must be taken
into account. On top of that the level of consciousness, capacity for
organization, the model, the aims, etc. In many ways Nicaragua still
has precapitalist productive relations. In the Caribbean for example,
in the cattle farming areas. in some agricultural areas, there are
still people that rent land within the terms of what is practically a
feudal system.<br><br>Nicaragua isn't Venezuela, and the Venezuelan
reality is complicated anyway. My point is that socialism can't be
decreed, is has to be built, and that is where the weakness of the FSLN
lies. Because in the construction of socialism - one of the aims of the
FSLN - it is not enough to resolve material problems if you aren't
simultaneously creating political consciousness, class consciousness. <br><br>Since
the FSLN stopped being a functionally organized political party, with
all that implies for a revolutionary party, what you have now is a
government carrying out its program without a political instrument that
accompanies that resolution of problems in a way that develops people's
political consciousness.<br><br>Sandinismo; a multi-class force<br><br>JC:
Another interesting aspect is that within the FSLN itself there are
different social classes, which gives a special dynamic to the
organization ...<br><br>WG: That is an interesting subject. The
European left forgets that in order to overthrow the Somoza
dictatorship, first the FSLN had to make a multi-class alliance - a
"wide front" in marxist terminology. That alliance had substantial
differences. First of all, the FSLN wasn't a party, but a
political-millitary organization.<br><br>We were always taught that
"from the FSLN a revolutionary party and a revolutionary army would
emerge." Ever since we were children we were taught that in the FSLN.
And, effectively, that is what happened. Those who said that from the
very beginning, since the founding of the FSLN, they were right. That
is what happened.<br><br>Then, later, from about 1969 - 70, members of
the middle classes whose ideologies had been influenced by liberation
theology, began entering the FSLN. That took place gradually at first
and then much faster - the process accelerated after the assault on the
house of Chema Castillo in 1974, because a lot of people's romantic
imagination was awoken by the images of victorious guerrilleros with
their red and black neck scarves and their rifles. Those people were
also inspired by a genuine desire to help to liberate Nicaragua from
the dictatorship, but they lacked political consciousness.<br><br>Of
course, the FSLN needed to constantly increase its popular support and
its access to resources, and this was a way of doing that. So the FSLN
was made up of much of the radicalized middle classes as well as the
rural and industrial workers sectors. The combination of these sectors
was what made the final offensive against the dictatorship
possible.&nbsp; <br><br>Secondly, and very importantly, middle upper
class sectors and members of the anti somocista bourgeosie made an
alliance with the FSLN - that is the Group of Twelve, which included
Sergio Ramírez, Ernesto Cardenal, Miguel D'Escoto and others. This
sector, which was an alliance, ends up merging with the FSLN.<br><br>So
from the point of view of class, we are talking about an organization
with a very heterogenous make up. And all the different sectors end up
merging, but not at a grass roots levels, at the level of the different
sectors' leaders - because different leaders of all those different
sectors are involved in the government, in the state, in the party. So
we had ministers, ambassadors, etc, with a relatively weak political
formation. The only one to develop as an important progressive
ideological force is Miguel D'Escoto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It was
the middle class and bourgeosie sectors that end up separating from the
FSLN during the first half of the 1990s together with a handful of
former guerrilleros from the traditional ranks of the FSLN. So among
the founders of the MRS you have former ministers, ambassadors and
other leaders.<br><br>The FSLN today is still a multi class organization<br><br>However,
within the FSLN today, you still have other multi-class sectors. There
are certain members of Sandinismo, people who occupied importants
positions within the first government, who found the capitalist formula
in the 1990s allowed them to become businessmen and accumulate personal
fortunes. They still called themselves Sandinistas, but speak from the
position of big businessmen. They were never excluded from the FSLN.
What guaranteed their ongoing membership of the FSLN was their loyalty
to the figure of Daniel as leader rather than their loyalty to the
FSLN's historical program, or the working classes. That is a problem
for the FSLN.<br><br>So you find yourself with phenomenons like Herty
Lewites and others, some who are still loyal to the FSLN, other who
aren't, for example Alejandro Martínez Cuenca. These individuals belong
to a sector that has accumulated capital - they are the so called
businessmen of the FSLN. They work on the professional sector to
capture their imagination and convert them into a lobby group within
the FSLN lobbying for their own interests. They are not interested in
party positions but in remaining close to the General Secretariat and
the possibility of an eventual public position. This group has gained
important spaces within the FSLN.<br><br>Also within the FSLN you find
impoverished sectors, people who used to work with the Armed Forces,
very radically minded people, mainly ex millitary or former members of
the millitary service. There is another sector of professionals from
impoverished backgrounds, who had the possibility to study - engineers,
lawyers. And then you have a huge number of former public employees
from the 1980s, who were made redundant in the 1990s - talented people
who were completely marginalized in the 90s. So the FSLN is very
diverse in terms of the class origin of its members and in terms of
their political and ideological positions.<br><br>The successes and failures of the FSLN's grass roots political work<br><br>A
significant sector of FSLN support, located mainly in the Segovias, has
maintained the mistique of revolutionary political work. It is no
coincidence that the best electoral work during the 90s was carried out
in the Segovias. In northern pacific regions of Leon and Chinandega
this type of political work has been recovered to a certain extent.
Although there is a different reality in those regions with
agricultural workers and many immigrant families. The local and
regional leadership in Leon has recovered in part the marxist political
formation. The results are plain to see. <br><br>In the southern
pacific regions of Carazo, Masaya, Granada (which have a different
class make up with the prevalence of small producers and small
businessmen who go to Managua to sell goods) there is a different
social reality because those regions didn't suffer a crisis of
unemployment like the northern pacific regions did. Here there was an
initial weakness, but the political work has been recovered to a
certain extent as the FSLN has increased its electoral success in the
area.<br><br>In 2000 the FSLN only governed three municipalities of
Carazo. Today we govern them all. In this area electoral results were
achieved, but not as a result of the work of local party structures,
which was not impressive. What helped us here is the electorate, which
is very strong minded.&nbsp; <br><br>In the center of the country, in
Chontales and Boaco, the FSLN has always been weak and still is. The
government has attended these regions with numerous programs and
benefits, but the FSLN has not achieved better electoral results. In
the Caribbean the FSLN has an alliance with a Miskito organization. <br><br>What
has been achieved, in terms of electoral success, in Matagalpa and
Jinotega, is as a result of successful government programs in those
areas. In Jinotega historically the FSLN has had little support. In
Matagalpa our support has grown thanks to government programs that have
helped to improve the party's relationship with rural workers and small
farmers there.<br><br>Idiosyncracies of the FSLN's party structure<br><br>Today,
the government programs are the impetus encouraging people to overcome
their fear of and apprehension about Sandinismo. But what is missing is
someone going around behind the scenes, taking advantage of these
positive results to renew the ranks of the FSLN, incorporating all
these people and providing them with an entity, helping them to evolve
politically. That is what is missing.<br><br>I believe that this power
group or lobby that I mentioned, made up of the Sandinistas that had
accumulated material and financial resources, remains a very
influential force within the FSLN.<br><br>The FSLN is still a
multi-class organization. That is part of the FSLN reality, and I don't
think that, from a historical point of view, it would be appropriate
for the party to become exclusively an organization for the
impoverished classes - that wouldn't fit into the Nicaraguan way of
thinking about society. To a certain extent, Sandinismo transcends
class issues.<br><br>So yes, you can accurately talk about Sandinismo
as having revolutionary and socialist positions, and you can also talk
about a certain sector of Sandinismo having reformist positions, of
members of the FSLN that today have social democratic positions.<br><br>Without
doubt, the most significant contingent within the FSLN is of the
workers. This contingent is represented by what today is called the
National Workers Front - that is the contingent with greatest force,
the one that is able to mobilize, the one that pushes for positive
changes for workers.<br><br>There is another Sandinista workers union -
the Sandinista Workers Central (CST) -, but it is more opportunistic,
and it hasn't been capable of defending workers interests with
authenticity. In the Free Trade Zones the CST, which represents a
minority, has followed a policy of class conciliation facilitating the
Korean, Taiwanese and US companies to continue implementing a labour
regime that is equivalent to semi
slavery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>This multi class
composition is reflected in the make up of the cabinet and generally in
the FSLN's policies. It is not possible to analyze the FSLN within the
classic political party norms. It has never been possible to do that
during the FSLN's history. And I think that that idiosyncracy is not
something that the European and North American left is able to
visualize. And it is very difficult to understand what is happening in
Nicaragua without taking into account that
perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The origins of Ortega's unipersonal hold on the FSLN<br><br>Now,
I also believe that the unipersonal leadership that exercizes Daniel
Ortega within the FSLN, while on the one hand is his main strength,
also becomes a factor that stiffles the organization's qualititive
internal debate towards a collectively devised direction for the
party's work. This is a result of what happened previously in the FSLN.<br><br>In
1997, the FSLN takes one of two paths; it decides to reform the state
and occupy positions within the state in order to create the
conditions, from these state positions, to win political power in
electoral processes, as opposed to the option of popular resistance, of
organization and accumulation of electoral social, political and
economic support based on a class struggle against the restoration of
capitalism.&nbsp; <br><br>By taking this decision to pact with the PLC
in order to win institutional positions, the FSLN sacrifices its nature
as a party of debate, of analysis, of collective decision making. And
there was much discontent about what was happening among sandinista
supporters at a grass roots level. Effectively what the FSLN direction
did as a result was, first of all, close down the spaces created within
the local party structures leaving an organizational skeleton made up
of only the most loyal militants, and, secondly, discourage Sandinistas
to continue embracing militant life.<br><br>JC: Was there another solution at that time?<br><br>WG:
I think there was, but to talk about that today is like talking about
the prehistoric period. There is a consummate fact and that is that the
FSLN is in power. Personally I would have liked the party to get into
power in a different way, but that is in the past. I fought for the
alternative option but I lost. They chose the other path, and, by
transitting that path, they achieved their goal, which was to get into
power.<br><br>I may not feel great about the method they chose, but the
fact of the matter is that they got into power and now, from the
government, they are doing the right things. I don't like what they
did, the pact with Aleman, the fact that there are corrupt people in
the FSLN, that's all true.<br><br>The government's actions so far have been impeccable<br><br>But
the government sworn into power on January 10th 2007 is basically a
government made up of new cadres of sandinismo, many of whom are
connected to popular struggles, and who are doing what is possible
taking into account the critical social and political conditions in the
country and fact that the correlation of forces in the National
Assembly is not favourable for the government.<br><br>The thing is that
there is this part of the European left that is trapped in what, from
their perspective, or mine, should be the reality, and therefore is
unable to see what the reality really is. I accept that this left had
their reserves before the FSLN came to power, or during the first six
months of the government, while they were waiting to see how they were
going to act. OK, fine - but the government's actions in general have
been impeccable.<br><br>Of course there have been errors. a grave
strategic error in my point of view is the therapeutic abortion policy.
The government still has the opportunity to rectify that mistake and I
think they are waiting for the political moment to do so. But the
concrete fact is that the policies put into play by this government are
aimed at benefitting the impoverished majority, at improving people's
living conditions.<br><br>Because sometimes we forget, Jorge, we forget
why we want to take power. We want to take power so that the
impoverished majority have a better life, so they have the opportunity
to be happy, so they can have a house, a fridge, a TV, so their
children can be well dressed, so they can have access to healthcare and
education, so they can go to Uni, so they can have holidays, so they
have the right to leisure activities - something the poor don't have
the right to.<br><br>Now - how do you reach that goal? You can do with
social justice and balance, or you can do it with social injustice and
imbalance for everyone else as long as you live well - which is what
capitalism does, especially European capitalism. Switzerland, France
and Sweden, for example, are all OK in material terms because there are
others in the third world that are not OK - because they exploit us.<br><br>So
the method varies, as do the values with which you put your method into
practise, but at the end of the day, what the FSLN wants, from a
leftist perspective, is for people's lives to be improved. Evo says
that, he has a little phrase - "to live better, to live well."<br><br>We
want to do things that allow people's lives to improve. That is our
objective, but it is not something that you can do by decree, nor by
pulling money out of a bank account you haven't got. There's no
generous millionaire who is going to give you everything you need. You
have to do it on the basis of your own efforts and the help of your
friends. And I believe that this government is doing that
well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If this government fails the FSLN would be ruined.<br><br>I
interpret this period of government as one of transition&nbsp; which
lays the social basis making possible a more political consciousness
and assuming we are successful in this, making a qualitative leap
either in this period of government or the next.So in this five year
period of government, the main task of the Frente Sandinista is to
carry out its programme.<br><br>If we are successful during this period
of government it will be much easier to make progress in terms of
political awareness, popular organization and society in general. If we
aren't successful, the FSLN would be ruined, in historical terms. It's
not just that the alternative would be the right wing, but that another
kind of left from within the FSLN with another way of doing things
altogether would probably be in a position to take over the party's
leadership.<br><br>The way I look at it, first of all, the FSLN had to
get into government, and then we had to govern without causing a
rupture with the US that leads the country to war, without causing a
rupture with the financial-oligarchal capital that leads the country to
war, to isolation, without causing a rupture with powers that be like
the Catholic Church of the Evangelical churches that would provoke a
rupture with society.<br><br>In other words the FSLN had to govern in
such a way as to avoid serious conflicts, that doesn't mean that the
sectors mentioned previously should be appeased. But trying to do that
in practise, is a very complex operation.<br><br>Without ALBA the government would permanently be in checkmate<br><br>JC:
If the political developments in Venezuela, in Bolivia and in other
Latin American countries had not taken place, things would have been
very different for the FSLN government ...<br><br>WG: It's like when we
triumphed in 1979. Without Cuba the Sandinista Revolution would never
have triumphed.&nbsp; Today, although we probably would have won the
2006 elections, we would not have been able to govern with such success
without Venezuela, without ALBA. Without the strength that ALBA
provides, this government would probably be in a permanent position of
check mate.<br><br>Not only capital can be globalized, so can struggle
and resistence, perhaps even solutions can be globalized. We wouldn't
have been able to overcome the critical energy shortage if it wasn't
for Venezuela. We wouldn't have been able to drastically improve
education and health care if it wasn't for Cuba.<br><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><b r=""><br>
