<p align="LEFT"><strong>Address by Rosario</strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Long live Sandino!</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Long live Blessed, Dignified and Forever Free Nicaragua!</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Long live the Revolution of Free and Upright Souls!</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">This is a Day of Illumination, this is a Day of Continuous Births and Rebirths of our General of Free Women and Men, General of Patriotic Nicaraguans, of Upright, Intelligent, Brave and Combative Peoples, and we feel full of his Light, of his True Life, and we declare ourselves as always, we proclaim ourselves as ever, his Sons, his Daughters, who Neither Sell Out, Nor Surrender, Ever.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Among all this Illumination we want to salute our Culture, our Art, our National Identity, which undoubtedly is Sandinista and Nicaraguan by the Grace of God.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">In these Days and in these Formidable Times, which are the Essence of the Luminous and Prodigious, Visionary and Prophetic Legacy of our General, we recognize that Torch, that Sacred Flame, of our Art, our Music, our Song, our Painting, our Performing Arts, our Crafts, our Traditional and Contemporary Dances, Full of Life and Dignified, as we are, as his Legacy of Light, Life and Truth.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">In this Square we are seeing a Momentous Representation of the Birth and the Wedding of our General and Blanquita... Let's us watch it. With more than 800 Artists who have presented and are presenting, in this case only from Managua, because across the whole the country we have seen and are seeing that Creative Force, because the Centers of Culture, Creativity and Art Schools are germinating and flourishing and we harvest all of this and the Wonderful, Exceptional Talent of our young women and men celebrating in Victorious Tumult the Father of the Sandinista People’s Revolution, the Teacher and Guide of our Triumphant Paths.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">We want to greet with all the recognition he deserves, the Great Choreographer, Maestro Alejandro Cuadra Baldizón, present in this Plaza de la Revolución as he was always present, imagining and creating the best choreography and scenarios, elevating our Dance to the stages of the best Theaters in the world. Here we celebrate, Alejandro, your Life and Legacy as our Patrimony.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Here too is Elvin Vanegas, also a Teacher and Choreographer, whom the Revolution sent to study in Socialist Countries and who now has the merit of working today with the young women and men of the Neighborhoods and Communities of our Nicaragua, and in particular of Managua, where he has trained hundreds of Artistic Groups that today acquire ever more Mastery, guided by his formidable Creativity.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Alao here is René Jaime, Alejandro's Heir and Disciple, who has followed in his footsteps, as a Revolutionary, as an Artist, multiplying the magnificence of the Macehuatl, and filling the cultural spaces of Alejandro's Miraculous Life, which continues reproducing via the formation of more and more Values, more and more Imagined Spaces, more and more Consolidation of our Identity and Culture, that Identity of Values reflecting us as we are, as we have been, as we want to be: Patriotic Nicaraguans by the Grace of God.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Unforgettable, Memorable, Ronald, Alejandro, in the Choreography of the Vaca Chota, the Solar de Monimbó, of El Güegüense, of the Toro Huaco, of the Managua Festivities, of the Festivities of the Purísima, of the Traditions of all our Blessed, Upright and Forever Free Nicaragua. Revolutionary and Evolutionary.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And here, as we say, William, Teacher, Director... we admire your labors, your incessant and courageous work that fills us all with pride.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">We have today, thanks to God, thanks to the Revolution, more than 600 Schools of Art in the Countryside...

<p><strong><b>Address by Daniel</b></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, Families of these Blessed Lands who are watching us all over Nicaragua, yes, all over Nicaragua, from the Communities of the Coco River to the Communities of the San Juan River, from the Communities that border Costa Rica to the Communities that border Honduras.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And no doubt the signal reaches Honduras, reaches Costa Rica, so Greetings to all the Brothers and Sisters who are watching us on this National Television Broadcast. And no wonder, no wonder that today we are celebrating the Birthday of one of the Great Giants of Our America, and of the World.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">On a day like today our General of Free Men and Women, Augusto Calderón Sandino, was born. He was born in Niquinohomo, a humble village, he was not born in any kind of Palace, he was born in a humble village.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And this child grew up, seeing and living the suffering of the Peasants, of the humble people, of the poor people, unemployment, hunger; and it fell to, already a young man, at the age of some of you here, it fell to him to see the corpse of a Hero pass by, who confronted the Yankee troops who had invaded Nicaragua in the years 1911, 1912. In those years when, after they overthrew governments, then the troops landed.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And General Benjamín Zeledón, a Nicaraguan with a patriotic sense of Nation, who loved his Nation, and did not surrender to the invaders; the invaders who traveled to Coyotepe, surrounding him there, telling General Zeledón to surrender, that they were going to spare his life if he surrendered. Yankee colonels arrived to parley with him, and he told them: The patriotic Nation does not surrender, the patriotic Nation is not for sale. And on October 4th 1912, his birthday, he fell under the bullets of the invaders and the traitors who accompanied the invading Yankees.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And that boy, Sandino, saw when they were paraded before him the corpse dragging it through the town, through the villages, so that it would provoke fear in the humble people, so that it would make them afraid, so that they would tremble in the face of the crimes of the Yankees. But what was it that they provoked in that young man, Sandino, Augusto Sandino? What did they provoke? He tells it himself, he says that it did not cause him fear, it did not cause him terror, it did not cause him panic, instead it caused him fury, fury against the invaders, fury against those who had assassinated General Zeledón, and at that moment the commitment, the anti-imperialist thought was forged in his Heart.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And we can say that just as Zeledón had in his Heart, the Heart of Andrés Castro and José Dolores Estrada, who years before had faced and defeated the Yankee invaders, then Zeledón's Heart, Zeledón's Consciousness, arose in Sandino. Notice, in a natural way, without belonging to any Political Party, without having any greater Ideology beyond Love of the People and the Love of his Neighbor. That was the ideology of our General Sandino.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And today we are here sharing with this Youth that is growing, growing in Knowledge, growing in Consciousness, growing in Love of their Neighbor, and as we have said, already on one occasion there in Niquinohomo, we saluted wthe Birthday of our General Sandino, we sang “Happy Birthday to You”, and we are going to sing it for him now :</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Happy birthday to you…! Happy birthday to you…! Happy Birthday Sandino! Happy Birthday to you!</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Long live Sandino!</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">So, celebrating Sandino's Birthday with Joy, with Song, with Dance, but also with Awareness, with the assurance of what we are forging, that we are part of this New World that is being forged, where the Imperialists of the Earth will be definitively defeated, because their Peoples will be overcome them, and Peace will reign in the World!</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">And the best proof of what Peace means is this Celebration today. If there was no Peace how could we celebrate our General? Would we be able to sing, could we dance, could we go to school? It is because there is Peace that we can celebrate our General's Birthday with Joy, and that is why we defend Peace.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">While the Imperialists live threatening and launching aggression and sanctions against our Peoples, they have waged brutal campaigns against the Fraternal People of Venezuela, the People of Bolívar, the People of Chávez. They even wanted to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro, they wanted to assassinate Nicolás; but we know, Nicolás, that you are a Leader who enlightens Our America, because in your hands, you raise up in your hands the Sword of Bolívar that Comandante Hugo Chávez gave you, which assures us, Nicolás, that you will overcome in these Battles and any future Battles that may come, and that you enjoy all the Love and Solidarity of the Nicaraguan People, you and Venezuela’s People, you and the People of Bolívar.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Think about that history and how Life turns out, it was Bolívar, as we know very well, the Great Liberator, who said: We have to unite to be strong; because he was already looking at Yankee imperialism launching aggression. And Sandino learned from this Thought of Bolivar and in the Army in Defense of National Sovereignty there were Venezuelan Brothers with Sandino, and that was when Sandino set out there in the mountains writing a Document which he sent to all the Presidents of Latin America, in which he gathered up the Dream of Bolivar, saying: These are the points on which we have to agree so to unite and achieve Peace and Security throughout our America. And that happens through Unity, of course, through being United, through Unity.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">We give thanks to God, who gives us the opportunity to be here with you, beloved young men and women, with your extraordinary Singing, Dancing, in your Studies and Sports. That is our Nicaraguan Youth, there is no Community where Singing, Dancing, Education, Distance Learning is not practiced.</span></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">That is to say, it is thanks to Peace that we are achieving these Miracles; thanks be to God who helps us defend Peace. And on this day we give thanks to God and we give thanks to you, to your Families, who have known how to accompany you, accompanying you in everyday tasks both in your Studies and also when they can help you at home</span></strong><span style="font-weight: normal">.<br />
<br />
What this tells us is that we really do have an enormous Treasure, an invaluable Treasure, in our country’s Youth. That's why Rubén said it with such clarity and such poise: Youth, Divine Treasure, Youth, Divine Treasure. That is the greatest Treasure that a Nation has, that Nicaragua has, that our Peoples have, Youth. An Aware, Courageous, Studious, Athletic Youth.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">We have you in every area of life, an Invincible Youth, always achieving every goals it sets itself, with the energy and courage to take on any challenge, and above all, to defend Peace. Defending Peace!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Compañera Rosario has given a review of this Field of Culture, she has reminded us of the Great Teachers, and other Brothers and Sister who accompany us here. Compañero Ramón Rodríguez, Director of the Rubén Darío National Theater, and currently too he is now Co-Director at the National Institute of Culture, together with Compañera Javiera Pérez.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Then too we are accompanied here by Compañera Reyna Rueda, Mayor of Managua; also, the Minister of Youth, Lucien Guevara; with us also are Compañero Sandinista Youth Leaders, Oscar Pérez; Darling Hernández, Daniel Sequeira. And there is also, as he was already introduced, this Master of Art as well, Ronald Abud... Happy Birthday, Ronald! Happy birthday to you too!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Well, Brothers and Sisters, Nicaraguan families, may we continue to be full of Joy, always with more Strength. Challenges give us more strength. If downpour comes and water soaks us, are we going to burst into tears? No! We’ll look for how to remove the water that might flood us, how to make use of some buckets; now that we are entering, seeing the first steps of the rains to come, the Rainy Season, when we all have to be prepared in our homes, helping ourselves, and those who have more or better conditions, helping the Sisters and Brothers who have more difficult conditions during a torrential downpour.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Because we do have cases of Families living in very precarious conditions, because we have still not been able to end Extreme Poverty, to which we must pay close attention, we have to end Extreme Poverty, that is a challenge we face.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">At the moment, a number of properties that were used for money laundering have been seized, properties where people were being swindled and properties were denied to people of good faithwho wanted to purchase the property with good intentions. All these properties amount to several millions, and they are in the hands of the Nicaraguan State; now the State has declared them to be State Property. What for? For the benefit of the Poor, to invest them in Social Programs, including Housing, Health, Education and Social Security.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Some banks are agitated now, when rather they seem to be accomplices of the fraudsters, because they did not comply with the rules when making a loan, and it seems likely in those cases which are being investigated, they are being investigated to punish all those who are guilty.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">But the important thing is that this ill-gotten wealth that was in the hands of criminals, this ill-gotten wealth is now in the hands of the State, at the disposal of the People, at the disposal of the Poor, at the disposal of the Peasants, at the disposal of our Youth.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">We salute, from this Plaza of the Revolution, the Family of our General Sandino, there are the grandchildren, great-grandchildren; we greet them on this day when we are commemorating the Birthday of the General.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">And to all of you, beloved Young Women and Young Men, to all of you, our congratulations, because today's display is one that has never been presented in Nicaragua, this is the first time it has been presented in Nicaragua, and presented to all our People, because we have broadcast it all over the country via the television network.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Long live our Young People!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Long live our Young People!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Long live our Young People!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">Sandino Lives On, the Struggle Goes On!</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style="font-weight: normal">A Free Nation or Death!</span></p>

This is how we work here, with Faith, with Trust in God, with Gratitude to the God of All Victories, because he makes us ever stronger, ever more courageous, ever more convinced that Victory belongs to our Peoples, Victory belongs to the Dignity of our Peoples, Victory belongs to the Struggle of our Peoples.</span></span></font></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: normal"><span style="background: #ffffff">United, as Sandino wanted us to be in this Latin America of Ours, this America of Ours, Our America-Caribbean, here we make our way... In this World, a World of Free and Combative Peoples, here we make our way, building that New Day which we are already inhabiting, the New World that we are already inhabiting, and exhorting each other, Always Further On, It is always possible to see the Dawn, knowing it is up to us to continue building Victories for Everyone.</span></span></font></strong></p>

<p align="LEFT"><strong><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: normal"><span style="background: #ffffff">An Embrace to all our Families, in all our Homes, our Affection and our Commitment to work tirelessly, as long as God gives us Life and gives us Energy, to Work, to Serve, to Strive, to Win. </span></span></font></strong></p>
