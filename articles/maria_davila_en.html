      </small></big> <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic;">María Elena Dávila is one of
the leaders of the struggle&nbsp; to defend sex worker rights in
Nicaragua. In November the affiliates of the Nicaraguan Sex
Workers Network (REDTRASEX) signed a collaboration agreement with the
Human Rights Ombudsman. This agreement is the first of its kind in the
American continent. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In this interview Dávila talks about the discrimination sex
workers are subjected to on a daily basis, the recent and blossoming
process of sex worker
organization in the country and the recently signed collaboration
agreement.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
Karla Jacobs: Before talking about the organization that you preside,
I'd like to talk a little about the day to day reality of sex work in
Nicaragua. What are the main risks sex workers face on a daily
basis? <br>
      <br>
María Elena Dávila: The main risk that we face is the
lack of security. Most sex workers work on the streets, the rest work
in nightclubs. We are subjected to discrimination and violence from
clients, from the owners of the nightclubs as well as from ordinary
people, our neighbours, people that know us. Sometimes you are
physically attacked, or you are abused verbally. <br>
      <br>
And it is not only the sex worker that is subjected to this sort of
discrimination but also her kids and the rest of her family. So
our families suffer the consequences of our work. <br>
      <br>
Another risk we face is the inadequate attention we receive from public
institutions like the police or at health centers and hospitals -
places we go for protection and support. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We are victims of police
discrimination and violence</span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
      <br>
KJ: Would you say that it is common, that it is normal, for police
officers to discriminate against sex workers? <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>MED: We live in a society
where women are stigmatized just for being women. And if you're a sex
worker then it's much worse. People always blame you if anything bad
happens to you. If a client does something to you, if he hit you or
made you do something you didn't want to do, no one wants to
listen. They'll say that you provoked him, or that you wanted to
steal from him. <br>
      <br>
So when you go to the police station to make a complaint about what
happened they
stigmatize you terribly. They don't want to know. They criticize you.
They don't value you as a human being with legally established
rights.&nbsp; <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
This is a problem that sex workers face across the country. In
Matagalpa the police don't let the girls wait for clients in the park.
They force them to leave. The girls in Matagalpa have suffered a lot of
violence from the police.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Another risk is the refusal to
use
condoms </span><br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>The other risk we face is not being able to protect
ourselves against STDs. Sometimes </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">clients refuse to use condoms, and
sometimes sex workers can't afford to buy condoms. This is an issue
that our organization has focused a lot of effort on. <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">KJ: Do you think
that the majority of sex workers don't use condoms? Or perhaps the
question should be - do you think the majority of clients refuse to use
condoms?<br>
      <br>
MED: In the past the problem of clients refusing to use condoms was
more common, but today progress has been
made. We know that the situation has improved because, according to
studies that have been carried out in Nicaragua, in 2003 4% of sex
workers were HIV positive. Today that figure has fallen to 2%. <br>
      <br>
That shows us that, as a result of the workshops and information
programs
offered by different organizations that focus on the issue of
protection against STDs, the proportion of sex workers that don't use
condoms has fallen. I would say that we have been able to normalize the
concept that, </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">sex work
should never be carried out </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">without a condom.
&nbsp; <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
KJ: In Nicaragua prostitution it is not a crime, but there is the
other issue of child prostitution. What position does your organization
have on the phenomenon of child prostitution which, according to
different studies, is on the rise in Nicaragua?<br>
      <br>
MED: Sex work and child prostitution are two very different things. It
is legal to pay for sex with a women over 18. But paying for sex with a
younger adolescent or a child is a very serious crime. When we talk
about sex workers we are talking about women of 18 or older. We
consider them as adults who are working as sex workers because they
have
made the decision to do so. An adult makes informed decisions while a
child or a young adolescent does what she is told to do or what she is
obliged to do. <br>
      <br>
They are two very different things. And of course we are opposed to
child prostitution. </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">If
we suspect under agers are working in the nightclubs we visit we take
immediate action. We go to the police. The owners of the nightclubs
know that is how we react to under agers.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
KJ: And the owners accept you visiting the clubs? <br>
      <br>
MED: Yes, they accept us. We haven't had any problems in that regard. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">It wasn't long ago we opened our
eyes
to the fact that we have rights </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">KJ: I'd like to talk about
the
sex workers organizations that exist in Nicaragua. I understand that
the organizational process is something that began only a few years
ago. What was the impetus to beign organizing? &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
MED: There are five organizations that have been supporting sex workers
in Nicaragua during the last few years - the Xilonem Association in
Esteli, the Women's Collective in Matagalpa, the Women's Center in
Masaya, the Meri Barreda Organization in León and the Latin
American and Caribbean Sex Workers Network (REDTRASEX) which is based
in
Argentina and to which different sex workers organizations across the
region are affiliated.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In 2006 REDTRASEX informed Xilonem about an international sex workers
encounter that they were going to carry out in El Salvador. They needed
three different sex workers from Nicaragua to attend the encounter. I
was one of the ones who attended. <br>
      <br>
It was a really important experience for us. The first thing they
taught us was to start to identify ourselves as women. It was in El
Salvador that we started to open our eyes to the fact that we have
rights. </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It became clear
that we were submissively
accepting what society says about us</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">. We realized that we had to start to
organize ourselves and fight
for our rights. <br>
      <br>
After the encounter in El Salvador there were others in Guatemala and
Argentina. REDTRASEX's main office in Argentina helped us with funding
applications and we were awarded a small amount of money from the UN
Population Fund (UNFPA). <br>
      <br>
We used that money to organize a regional encounter here in
Estelí and formalize our attempts to form a sex workers
organization in this part of Nicaragua. The encounter took place in a
nightclub because the majority of sex workers can't go out. <br>
      <br>
KJ: Why can't they go out?<br>
      <br>
MED: Because they work with contracts that only allow one
day free a week - Monday. We are able to go and visit them there and
have
meetings but they can't leave the club because of their contracts - we
would cause them problems with their boss. <br>
      <br>
That meeting took place on November 27th 2007.&nbsp; We called the
organization the Association of Nicaraguan Sex Workers "Sunflowers." </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
      <br>
A </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">couple of months later</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">, with the help of the Meri
Barreda Organization in León, we organized a national sex
workers
encounter, where more sex workers affiliated
themselves to our organization.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
      </span><br>
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">At the start, although we
had formed the organization, we weren't able to represent ourselves
well in any formal environments - with the press, or with public
institutions -&nbsp; because, in order to
participate in those spaces you need to be prepared, you need to know
certain things, you need to know what you're going to talk about. <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">It has been during this last
year that we have been making ourselves known </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>During this last year, i</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">n
representation of the Nicaraguan sex workers organizations,</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> I traveled to Argentina where they
have been preparing an application for funding with the <a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/hannah/Documentos/TCS_in_depth_articles/www.theglobalfund.org">World
Fund </a>[an international
organization that funds projects to fight against AIDS and Malaria].
They were applying for funding to carry out a project&nbsp; with sex
workers across Latin America and the Caribbean. &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span> <br>
It was difficult because first we had to be awarded a letter from the </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In-Country Coordination Commission</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> here in Nicaragua - a </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">commission made up of representatives
of different
institutions and organizations including the Health Ministry. All the
projects looking for funding with the World Fund have to be approved by
the c</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">ommission in
their respective country. <br>
      <br>
So I went to do a presentation about the proposed project. It was tough
but the commission approved the project.&nbsp; <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> <br>
It was during the meeting with the Coordination Commission
that I made contact with other organizations including the Human Rights
Ombudsman Office.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
      <br>
Also during the last year UNFPA gave us US$10,000 for a human rights
awareness project with sex workers. As part of the project we carried
out five workshops and two national encounters all focused on human
rights. These encounters were invaluable in that they helped us to
strengthen the organization that we had already established. On top of
that a number of journalists and representatives of different
institutions attended including members of the National Police.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
It has been during this last year that we began making ourselves known
as an organization in Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
KJ: I understand that your organization has 125 members. What does
being a member imply?<br>
      <br>
MED: It basically means that you have a committment to the
organization. <br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua sex workers have to work almost everyday because that is
how they guarantee they can buy food for their kids. But workers that
want to be part of the organization have to be dedicated enough, for
example, to pay their own travel and other expenses if there is a
meeting in Managua or another city.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It is not easy to make a sex worker see that, she has the right to be
part of an organization like ours, but that in order to fulfil that
right she has to make a sacrifice. <br>
      <br>
Whenever an organization wants to work with us or wants to get to know
us we always emphasize the importance of funding being put towards the
transport costs of our members. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
These 125 members have received training on issues like human rights.
They have helped organize different events and activities. They are
people who have identified themselves with the cause. <br>
      <br>
Currently we are working on leadership training within the
organization. So far we have ten leaders, three in Masaya, three in
Matagalpa and the rest in Leon. <br>
      <br>
There is another sex workers organization in the Department of
Matagalpa covering the municipalities of San Ramon, Mulukuku,
Río Blanco. The organization is called "Swallows." Both
organizations [Sunflowers and Swallows] belong to the Sex Workers
Network (REDTRASEX). &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
We want to create a network of representatives across the country to
provide support to sex workers wherever they find themselves. Because
one of the complications we face is that most sex workers don't work in
the area they actually live in. So what we want is to create a support
network so that, wherever the workers are they have somewhere to go to
look for support if something happens to them. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our main demand is that our
rights are respected</span><br>
      <br>
KJ: What are the main things your organization demands from the
Nicaraguan State?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
MED: Our main demand is that they acknowledge us as human beings, that
they respect our rights just like they would the rights of any other
Nicaraguan citizen. <br>
      <br>
We demand that they recognize the work we do is an occupation like any
other occupation.&nbsp; Because in Nicaragua prostitution is not a
crime. And anyway, we don't promote sex work. Sex workers are in this
line of work as a result of their own spontaneous decision. If you are
in this line of work and you want to be in this line of work then it's
your right. <br>
      <br>
We also demand that the attention we receive from public institutions
is the same as that given to any other citizen. Because, for example,
if a sex worker goes to the health center because she's got a cold or a
sore throat the first thing they say to her is "what do you do?" And
when she tells them what she works in they say "lie down I want to
check you over." And what they want to check is her vagina. </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
We aren't treated like normal people. We are treated like aliens.
People don't realize that we have feelings. That we have hearts. <br>
      <br>
Our struggle is difficult because, by being involved in this process
the amount of criticism you receive increases. But, we know that if we
don't fight we'll never achieve what we have set out to achieve. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The collaboration agreement with
the Human Rights Ombudsman</span> <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>KJ: I would like to talk
a bit about the collaboration agreement you recently signed with the
Human Rights Ombudsman. What does it involve?&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
MED: Basically what the agreement involves is that representatives of
the different sex workers organizations in Nicaragua will form part of
the Ombudsman office's human rights training team. That is the team of
human rights facilitators who carry out workshops with all the public
sector workers including police officers. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
For us it is a really important opportunity to be part of that team
because it means that we can present ourselves </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">to representatives of all the
different public institutions</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> as normal people with equal rights
to representatives of all the different public institutions. Once the
agreement is put into practice next year we will have the chance to
work in the Center, North and Pacific parts of the country. <br>
      <br>
The agreement was drafted with the help of all our members and with
legal advice from the Ombudsman's office. We also sent a copy of the
draft to the main office of REDTRASEX in Argentina so they could make
suggestions. <br>
      <br>
We had to act fast because Ombudsman Omar Cabeza's period in office
came to an end on December 10th. In the end, with invaluable support
from lots of different organizations, we came up with the final version
which Omar and I signed on November 23rd in Leon. The signing of the
agreement represented a massive victory for us. <br>
      <br>
KJ: Is it the first time that a sex workers organization collaborates
directly with a public institution?<br>
      <br>
MED: It's the first time in Nicaraguan history. <br>
      <br>
In this country there are lots of organizations that support sex
workers - they carry out workshops, they provide condoms - but they're
not going to encourage you to protest for your rights.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
For that reason we decided that the first thing we had to do as an
organization was to try to create a positive identity for ourselves as
human beings with equal rights to everybody else. How could we defend
our rights if we didn't even know what they were?<br>
      <br>
KJ: Through REDTRASEX in Argentina are you aware of the number of
countries in the region that have signed agreements similar to the one
you recently signed with the Ombudsman?<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">MED: I think we are
the first. In Nicaragua we have been able to move forward with giant
steps compared to sex worker organizations in other countries that have
existed for years. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our plans for the future </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
Now we are looking to establish greater legal status for our
organization. The Swedish Agency for International Development [ASDI]
is helping us with that. And Omar Cabezas is helping us with our
juridical personality. <br>
      <br>
Once we have a juridical personality we'd have so much more potential.
There are lots of organizations that want to fund us but they can't
unless we have greater legal status. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
There are lots of things we need. We need an office, a computer, a
phone. We don't have any of that. But more than anything what we need
is financial support so we can continue involving more sex workers in
meetings and workshops. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
KJ: Am I right that you are thinking about carrying out a study about
sex work in Nicaragua?<br>
      <br>
MED: Yes. We want to do a study because we don't know how many sex
workers there in Nicaragua. There are other organizations that have
done studies but they are a bit random - for example </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">based on some kind of formula </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">they'll just say there are so many in
such a such a neighbourhood, so many in such a such a town. <br>
      <br>
We want to do our own study because twe know that the girls don't give
that kind of information to other people. We know where they are, how
they are and how to reach them. <br>
