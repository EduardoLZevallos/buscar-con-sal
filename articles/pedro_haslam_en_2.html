 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pedro Haslam is the President of the
Institute of Rural Development
(IDR) and a member of the Board of Directors of the recently
established
Nicaraguan Institute for
the Promotion of the Cooperative Sector (INFOCOOP). He is also
President of
the Nicaraguan Federation of Agro Industrial Cooperatives (FENIAGRO)
which is one of the biggest organizations of cooperatives in Nicaragua
representing over 27,000 small farming families.</span> </span></div>
      <br>
In this second part of the interview Haslam talks in depth about the
plans the Rural Agricultural Public Sector (SPAR) has to mitigate the
effects of the recent drought provoked by El Ni&ntilde;o which have
been felt
in several municipalities of northern, western and central Nicaragua
during the last few months. To read the first part of the interview

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The effects of El Ni&ntilde;o in
Nicaragua </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: I would like to talk a bit
about the drought caused by El Ni&ntilde;o which affected different
parts of the country during the last few months of the rainy season.
What specific effects does the Rural Agricultural Public Sector
(SPAR) anticipate during the next few months in the areas
affected by the drought?<br>
      </span><br>
PH: To talk about the drought or El Ni&ntilde;o is to talk about
another of the crises that exist in the world - the crisis caused by
climate change. And the first thing I want to clarify about climate
change is that it is a crisis that was not provoked by countries like
Nicaragua, but that we are very negatively affected by. The same
applies to the financial crisis, the energy crisis,
the food crisis. All these crises originate in the "developed"
countries. <br>
      <br>
With regards to the climate crisis we are severely affected in
Nicaragua. Today there is a geographical division in Nicaragua that
didn't used to exist - now we have dry zones and humid
zones which we didn't used to have. We are affected almost every year
now by hurricanes, droughts.
Our soil has been degraded. <br>
      <br>
This year we have been affected by another period of this cyclical
crisis. The thing is, that the cycles are getting shorter. In other
words we experience hurricanes, flooding and droughts more frequently
as time goes by. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Intensify third crop cycle to
guarantee seed production</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Currently, the Production
Cabinet, which is what we call the SPAR, is working on these issues. We
recognize that certain areas have been affected by less intense
rainfall during the second crop cycle <span style="font-style: italic;">(siembra
de postrera).</span> So right now our plan is to intensify sowing for
the third crop cycle <span style="font-style: italic;">(siembra de
apante)</span> in
those areas where a third crop is possible like the Caribbean Coast,
Nueva Guinea, R&iacute;o San Juan. <br>
      <br>
President Daniel has instructed seed production activity to be
intensified as part of a contingency plan in order to ensure the
availability of seeds for the first crop cycle <span
 style="font-style: italic;">(siembra de primera)</span> of next year.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Is that because it is
assumed that farmers whose crops failed during the second crop cycle of
this year won't have seeds to sow next year?</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
PH: Yes. What farmers normally do is save seed from one cycle to sow
for the next cycle. So when one crop cycle fails many farmers are left
without seeds. In the case of the State there is a large organized
effort to guarantee seed production during the first cycle for the
second cycle, during the second cycle for the third cycle and during
the third cycle for the first cycle of the next year. <br>
      <br>
So, right now a special plan to guarantee seed production is being
carried out. This plan is being coordinated by INTA [the Nicaraguan
Institute of Agricultural Technology]. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We want to support people in
such a way that they can produce their own food<br>
      <br>
      </span>Why did I start by talking about production? Because one
of the main objectives of this
government is to recuperate people's
dignity. Dignity is one of our
ancestral and revolutionary values. <br>
      <br>
We have said that what we should do is support farmers so they can
produce their own food, and so they can have
some left over to sell in order to cover the cost of other
things they need which cannot be produced by working the
land. <br>
      <br>
So right now we are focussing our efforts on the zones where the third
crop cycle is possible. We are
implementing poverty mitigation programs providing people with the
tools they need to produce. <br>
      <br>
We have been in meetings with the FAO [the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organization], with the World Food Program, with the World Bank, with
all the organizations that work on the issue of food security in order
to coordinate all the different efforts that the government is
directing. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Contingency plans, not emergency
plans </span><br>
      <br>
But at the same time it is necessary to say that we are not in an
emergency situation as many have tried to make out. There is no famine
in the
country. We must be clear on this point, the drought caused by El
Ni&ntilde;o is not provoking a lack of food in the country. We are not
at
that stage. It is important to be clear about that. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Yes we are working on
contingency plans. Not emergency plans. They are two different things.
We are working on contingency plans to prevent an emergency situation.
We are working to avoid the need for food handouts. However, if a
situation should arise where a certain community or set of
communities experiences a lack of food and the only solution is food
handouts, then the government would do that. This government would not
let anybody die of hunger.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
But it is important to emphasize that there is no famine in Nicaragua.
What there <span style="font-style: italic;">has</span> been is a
media campaign aimed at creating the
impression that there is an emergency in the country. And that campaign
is aimed to a certain extent to influence domestic
opinion, but more than anything it aims to influence international
opinion. The objective is to create the impression that the FSLN
government is an inoperable government, that it is insensitive to
social
problems. <br>
      <br>
There was famine during Enrique Bola&ntilde;os' government when the
country was affected by the international coffee price crisis. Many
children died of hunger on the highways at that time. <br>
      <br>
Today there is absolutely no sign of famine. And the different
government institutions are organized, we are prepared to confront the
situation caused by El Ni&ntilde;o. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The IDR has mitigation projects
in affected areas </span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
The IDR is carrying out what we call a family project in 33
municipalities which
have been identified as the worst hit by the drought. Some people may
say that the IDR has a more agro industrial focus now and that we
have forgotten about rural families in drier areas. <br>
      <br>
But no, we are supporting families in those areas with a
micro-irrigation project. For example we are working in Boaco and
Chontales where we have a project that aims to create more jobs in
rural areas with backyard production among other things. We have also
been facilitating community wells. MAG-FOR [the Ministry of
Agriculture] also has its own programs along similar lines.<br>
      <br>
In other words, we are organized and we are leading the process of
mitigation. We are analysing the impact of some of our programs. For
example if we are providing people with farm animals and those animals
are going to compete with the members of the family for food in the dry
season, then we have to review that situation. <br>
      <br>
So, yes, we are the mitigation process is in progress. And in Nicaragua
we
have food reserves. We have been looking into that. The country has not
only the food reserves in ENABAS [the State Basic Food Company] where
there are more than three months
worth of reserves as demanded by the international organizations that
specialize on those issues. But we should remember that the reserves
small farmers and other producers have at home or on their farm, those
all form part of the national food reserves. Because the vast majority
of farmers and producers keep as much corn and beans as they can for
the year. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: It's interesting to hear
that you feel certain that if there were food shortages in any given
area the government would be willing to provide food handouts. It
could well become a real problem because there are sectors of the rural
population, mainly the most impoverished sectors, who do not have the
option of buying food if their harvests fail. <br>
      <br>
Maybe you can expand more on your comment that the government would be
willing to resort to food handouts if it was necessary in certain
areas. It would also be useful if you could mention the municipalities
most
affected by the drought. <br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most affected
municipalities </span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
PH: There is a list of the most affected areas which includes the
municipalities in Madriz, Le&oacute;n, Chinandega, certain
municipalities in Matagalpa mainly the ones that border on the
department of Managua, a couple of municipalities of Boaco. <br>
      <br>
The important thing is that the Sandinista government, the FSLN, has a
bigger and more varied territorial organization network than almost any
other party in any other country. We aren't just talking about the
Citizen Power Councils, there are the cooperatives, the communal
associations, women's organizations. In other words, the government has
a great diversity of organizations and of channels of information which
provide us with fresh information, with trustworthy information about
the situation at a grass roots level. <br>
      <br>
And of course the government institutions are working with the FAO and
the other organizations like the WFP in order to establish a joint
criteria regarding the situation so as to permit the highest possible
level of coordination and effectiveness of our actions. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We don't want to create more
dependency among the population </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
The issue of food handouts is very delicate for the government because
we don't want to create more dependency among the population on
programs or institutions. When I say that we are working to reinstate
people's dignity what I mean is that the government knows that people
feel good if they are producing their own food.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <br>
We work to create sustainability for people with regards to their
ability
to establish a productive base, even if that base is very small. The
important thing is that it is their productive base which will
guarantee, if tomorrow the
World Food Program doesn't turn up, that they can produce their own
food. <br>
      <br>
For example, if there is a well in the community and between all of us
we can carry out the necessary maintenance or install a micro
irrigation system, which could be really rustic, but if I can do that
with the rest of my community then at some point in the future when no
foreign or national organization is helping me, I can produce my own
food. <br>
      <br>
The crisis provoked by climate change isn't just going to affect us
once. Like I said earlier, the cycles are increasingly short. So we
need to get these communities producing food. We need to help people
generate life in their communities. It's not that we have all the
resources we need to solve everyone's problems but at least we are
working to solve specific problems in specific areas. <br>
      <br>
I always say to people: "thank God that the FSLN is in government, and
that Daniel Ortega is at the front of that government." Because in
these times of crisis I don't dare to think what sort of a situation we
would be in if we had a neoliberal government. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The government's efforts to
stabilize food prices<br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-style: italic;">KJ: Changing the
subject, Pedro, I have heard different people say things like, "yes,
maybe the country is producing more food, but the prices never go
down." I wonder what you have to say about that perception from part of
the population. I know it is a very complicated issue.&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>PH: When you talk about
fluctuating prices you are talking about inflation. In this country
there has been no inflation in 2009 according to official statistics.
But, one of the unofficial indicators of inflation that the general
public feels is the price of basic products at the point of sale. <br>
      <br>
[In the past the prices of the most basic products have been very
unstable as a result of the effect of speculation. However, over the
last few years] when the there is an attempt on the speculative market
to send prices soaring the government can activate instruments, like
ENABAS, not to regulate but to stabilize the price.<br>
      <br>
ENABAS is used as a price stabilizing instrument. One must be clear
about that because the State does not regulate prices. Although many
think it should do. I would say the majority of poor people in this
country would like the State to regulate food prices. <br>
      <br>
The price of basic products sold at the ENABAS supervised community run
points of
sale is established by the State. And then there is the other market,
the free market where things can be bought and sold at any price. <br>
      <br>
The number and coverage of the community run points of sale supervised
by ENABAS has increased significantly. They are not only in the
neighbourhoods now, but also in different institutions as part of an
attempt to make worker's salaries go further. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Input prices are out of our
control </span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
The issue of prices is important. And there is a process which is part
of the international financial crisis that has to do with inflation and
the devaluation of the dollar. As a result of the devaluation of the
dollar, and the fact that we use a lot of imported materia prima, the
production costs for producers go up. It would be different if we
produced everything here in Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
And another factor is that the same materia prima we import is
subsidized for producers in other countries. Indirectly producers in
impoverished countries pay for that subsidy because the price we pay is
elevated [to cover the cost of the subsidy in rich nations]. <br>
      <br>
Then there are the fuel prices which are very high. The international
price of a barrel
of oil nearly hit US$80 again last week. The price of fertilizer is
also high. And even though we have the Fertilizer for the People
Program, thanks to ALBA, the prices of other inputs are still very high.<br>
      <br>
Let's take a look at what happened in 2007. I remember that farmers
were selling a hundred weight of beans at C$400, which is equivalent to
C$4 a pound. But, at the end of 2007, consumers were paying between
C$18 and C$27 for a pound of beans. <br>
      <br>
That's a significant different in price - and all that profit goes to
the middleman who doesn't have have any production costs except for the
cost of the transaction and perhaps the cost of the capital that he
invested. But the middleman has no production costs nor does his work
involve risks.<br>
      <br>
Because if there is a drought and the farmer doesn't produce anything,
then the middleman doesn't buy anything. The only risk is not investing
and not making any money. Meanwhile if the farmer sows and it stops
raining then he loses what he invested.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So that year, in 2007, the government's reaction to the situation I
described earlier [regarding the price of beans], which for the
Nicaraguan people was an unsustainable situation, was to set up the
first ENABAS
supervised points of sale. And as a result of that
government action within two weeks the price of a pound of beans was
reduced from C$23 to C12. <br>
      <br>
We believe that with the installation of more ENABAS points of sale,
the involvement of more farmers organized in different associations,
and the support of a government that facilitates channels for purchase,
storage and sale, this expression of fair trade between Nicaraguan
producers and Nicaragua consumers will become stronger and the prices
of basic products will stabilize further. This process is taking place
as a result of the development of direct relations between farmers and
state institutions in each department of the country.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So, yes we are putting into practise a plan that will help to solve the
problems surrounding basic food prices.&nbsp; </td>
