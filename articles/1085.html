<p><b>Address by Daniel</b><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, families who are watching us, who are listening to us there in the communities of the River Coco, who are watching us in Waspam, in San Carlos, in all those communities there along the River Coco; who are watching us and listening to us also in the capital of the Autonomous Region of the Northern Caribbean, Bilwi, its name, its original root, Bilwi; and they are listening to us in that whole Region which before was totally separated from the Pacific Region of Nicaragua, because there were no communication channels that would allow us and the brothers and sisters of those communities to communicate with the Pacific.<br />
<br />
There we were, at the Triumph of the Revolution, with that immense River, the Wawa, and here is Raquel, who is worthy representative of those Caribbean Regions of Nicaragua, in charge of the First Secretariat of the National Assembly. This is the People governing, it's the Communities governing, it's Women governing... Yes, Raquel! Indeed, Raquel!<br />
<br />
And that River became impassable when the rainy season came, and even when the rains didn’t come the only way to cross to get to that Region, to reach its different communities, towns, cities, counties, municipalities, was by vehicle, bus, truck, or whatever, that had to board a barge, there was the barge, and on the barge they would cross to the other side, and the vehicles would drive off the barge and resume the road to Bilwi. Because also at that time very few communications routes existed linking the cities, the villages, the communities of the Caribbean.<br />
<br />
Today, you brothers and sisters of the Caribbean, brothers and sisters of the different communities, the Miskitos, the Mayagnas, the Ramaquis, the Afro-descendants, all of the North Caribbean and the South Caribbean, know that what is happening in these times, is a true Miracle, a true Miracle! It seemed like a mission impossible to make a bridge over the River Wawa.<br />
<br />
Every time we traveled around the area and arrived there, we used to said: When will it be possible to build a bridge? When? Much less did it occur to us that other communication routes could be opened that linked the communities and regions that were isolated there.<br />
<br />
And when we look towards the South Caribbean, sisters and brothers of Bluefields, sisters and brothers of Pearl Lagoon, sisters and brothers of all those communities, well, you all well remember that until recently how it was to reach Bluefields. We had to go to El Rama, and in El Rama we had to take the boat, and in the boat we had to go to Bluefields, and that way we could reach the communities that we wanted to visit.<br />
<br />
It is also true that there was an airfield there in Bluefields, but the problem was the cost of making the trip by plane. That is, how many brothers and sisters who are listening to us, who are watching us, in the North Caribbean, the South Caribbean, how many of you could make the trip by plane? Very few. The vast majority had to do it by the river.<br />
<br />
And suddenly we have another miracle, two great miracles: the bridge over the Wawa, and the communication by roads linking other areas in regions where it seemed impossible to build roads like the ones that have been built. Beloved brother, retired General Oscar Mojica, there working with all his strength, with all his will to serve the People, and the workers, equally. We are filled with pride by the construction workers, because they have carried out works in difficult areas, in areas where it is constantly raining; that is, there are no prolonged summers there like those we have here in the Pacific; therefore, the work is more difficult, to be working in the rain, to be building roads.<br />
<br />
And it is concrete roads that have been built, like that immense road that leads to Bluefields, a concrete road. And those who best value what a road means, like the one that has been built, the road we have managed to build, are the brothers and sisters who live throughout that Region, and the members of the communities that live along where that road has advanced and been opened and installed, because they are brothers and sisters who will now have the opportunity, the possibility of developing in every aspect of life, in education, in health care, in productive activity, in trade.<br />
<br />
That is, an area that was frozen has been activated by the highway, and I'm talking about an area where now health centers, schools, and modern hospitals have also been multiplying, where modern hospitals are being built. There the hospitals that we knew at that time were already obsolete, and thanks to the efforts of the doctors, the nurses, the population was treated there, albeit in very precarious conditions. Not now.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">In the same way the Nicaraguan population in the Pacific Region or in the Central Region has already had multiple hospitals, hospitals built with all the standards of a modern hospital, such that they have the instruments for the care of the population, instruments that allow to better define the health status of the patient who arrived with an illness, because there is the equipment now, the kind of modern equipment that was previously available only in very few hospitals, now they have multiplied throughout our country.<br />
<br />
Also roads and highways. These communications are vital, fundamental for the development of a country, because with good communications you can then build hospitals, schools, training centers, promote the training of farmers and ranchers, develop programs and projects and multiply them.<br />
<br />
And all the activities that take place in our country, which ensure attention for Nicaraguan Families, attention for children, young People, adults... All this attention has been limited, and now has been improving.<br />
<br />
That is to say, there we have areas where we can ensure that we can make sure we implement the People as President, that the needs of the impoverished are being met, that the needs of peasant families are being met, guaranteeing them roads, highways, training, technical programs, so those families obtain better and greater performance in their productive activity.<br />
<br />
That has multiplied throughout the country, it is no longer only a question of primary and secondary school, but also education for young people, for adults, peasants, workers, small and medium-sized business people, who with the methods of science, technology and communication of thee New Times, can receive this knowledge via the tens and hundreds of technical, technology schools in the area.<br />
<br />
And so we see how they are managing to give a greater yield to their productive activity. How also young people manage to develop their entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship that is multiplying throughout the country, entrepreneurship for Life, entrepreneurship so that young people can have a livelihood that gives them independence, giving them independence because they are not salaried, but they have their own business, and thus by having their own business they are independent; others will be studying and they also set up their business, that is, they are still training but they have their business, entrepreneurship. It is amazing the way in which entrepreneurship has multiplied throughout the country.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">We could keep listing all this, but all this starts from a principle, no matter how well intentioned a government may be, no matter how good our intentions as leaders may be, no matter how good our government policies are, if there is no Peace, these programs cannot function. Without Peace, you simply cannot build schools, you cannot build roads, you cannot build hospitals.<br />
<br />
We already know how terrible war is, the wars that Nicaragua has experienced, the attempted coups that Nicaragua has experienced; all the bloodshed and pain caused by terrorists, all the damage to the Economy; but, eve
