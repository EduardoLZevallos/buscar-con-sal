<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA AT THE IX MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE SANDINISTA POPULAR REVOLUTION (CES-RPS)</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Theme: “Analysis and Debate on the Role of Nicaragua in a New Multipolar World”</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Venue: MINREX<br />
Friday, October 18, 2024<br />
Time: 12:00 p.m.</strong></em></p>

<p>Comrades Members of the European Solidarity Committee with our Sandinista Popular Revolution and with the peoples who defend their rights, self-determination and their own paths in the world,</p>

<p>Comrade Jaume Soler,</p>

<p>Comrades Coordinators of the Coalition of Solidarity with the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>It is a special honor for me to be able to address you on the occasion of the beginning of three days of work of this group, created for solidarity with the peoples who continue to stand firm in defending our rights.</p>

<p>I want to begin by transmitting the fraternal, brotherly and revolutionary affection from Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Comrade Rosario Murillo, who from the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity and from the Sandinista Front for National Liberation continue to lead our People, Government and Party along the paths of greater victories.<br />
<br />
Victories that are significant in this besieged world, attacked by the darkest forces in history, now installed within neoliberal governments, which have nested in the societies of the capitalist world of the global north, and from there they try to impose their hegemony and their corrupted thoughts.</p>

<p>A very dangerous world, characterized by the emergence of the vilest forms of capitalist exploitation. A neo-fascist ideology, which stops at nothing, which does not respect rights, treaties, or agreements when it comes to unleashing its destructive fury on peoples and the planet in order to defend their way of thinking.</p>

<p>These times of great confusion are also of great clarity on the need to continue working for that Multipolar World that is flourishing before and with us. A Multipolar and Polycentric World, free from hegemonies and unilateralism, free from Neocolonial, Imperial, Fascist impositions, in which we can deepen harmonic bonds of friendship, with respect to the Sovereignty, Independence and Self-determination of the Peoples of the World. A world that promotes unconditional cooperation and solidarity.</p>

<p>This new world belongs to all of us, to the Peoples who continue to walk the paths of unity, defending and forwarding the revolution. Because to be revolutionary at this stage is also recognizing and working tirelessly for Peace, which is not only a Right, but a necessity.</p>

<p>Sisters and brothers,<br />
<br />
We salute you who live in the belly of the monster, as José Martí characterized it. You who have to endure the terrible economic, political and cultural consequences of the neofascist and neoliberal ideology.</p>

<p>We express our respect to you who remain firm, with strength and the unwavering will to continue fighting, from within, for your own rights and outwards for the rights of the peoples of the world.</p>

<p>For us, this has enormous and significant value. Speaking and acting in solidarity, in these times, has very special characteristics.</p>

<p>This revolution that comes from and is nourished by the Nicaraguan people, has its greatest expression of dedication and sacrifice in our Heroes and Martyrs, among whom we count, with special recognition, brothers and sisters who came from far away in terms of distance, but very close in terms of coincidences in the struggle for social justice.<br />
<br />
Today we pay tribute to brothers Berndt Koberstein and Tonio Pflaum who came to our land, driven by the idea of ​​building a more just world and who gave their lives for those ideas. We also remember our brother Jacinto Suarez, who fought from almost childhood for the liberation and the revolution in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>In this tribute, I think Berndt's words, written about what he did as an internationalist, a month before his death on July 28, 1986, are appropriate: "This is the most beautiful work I have ever done in my life... You know, the many deaths that imperialism has caused in this and other countries are not its only crime; the millions of dreams that it destroys, the many millions who are condemned to live in misery or who are already born into it, without being able to escape from it; that is a much greater crime."<br />
<br />
Shortly before turning thirty, this German trade unionist brother, this internationalist dreamer, who collaborated with the Sandinista Popular Revolution on a project to supply drinking water in Wiwilí, Jinotega, was murdered by the Contras in Zompopera.</p>

<p>We remember beloved Doctor Tonio Pflaum, also murdered in Zompopera, in April 1983, in a criminal ambush where other brothers, health workers, were also killed. His letters to his relatives and brothers and sisters in struggle show the difficult health conditions in those communities in the north of the country, besieged by the imperialist intervention. He and his dedication to the poor still live in the historical memory of those communities, who remember him with special affection.</p>

<p>The almost 50 thousand deaths caused by the imperialist intervention in the 80s included many internationalist brothers and sisters who came to help us build this beautiful Revolution. On this history, on this memory, we continue to build the Sandinista Popular Revolution today in this 21st century.</p>

<p>Let us think for a moment if Tonio and Berndt could see the great advances that began in the first stage of the Revolution and that we are continuing and consolidating in this Second Stage of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Let us imagine them there standing on that majestic bridge over the Coco River in Wiwilí or traveling, without any obstacles, along the paved roads in that area. Let us imagine them seeing the dozens or hundreds of healthcare centers, maternity homes, hospitals, drinking water projects, electrification, schools that have sprung up with the Revolution in the most remote communities of our country.<br />
<br />
Imagine yourselves, brothers and sisters, who left the comfort of your homes, to accompany the construction of our dreams, many of you here present.</p>

<p>We, the Sandinistas, remain committed to the teachings that, from a very young age, almost from childhood, the Sandinista Front instilled in us. We remain committed to a more just world and, as Che said, to feel deeply any injustice committed against anyone anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In this second stage of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, the enemies of justice, of truth, the enemies of the rights of the people are the same as in the past, but they come wrapped in a different way.</p>

<p>In these times we have to know how to identify and find our revolutionary and progressive north in the midst of this tide of falsehoods, distortions of the real truth, as our Comrade Rosario Murillo says.</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers,</p>

<p>You are all very knowledgeable about the history of Nicaragua, I do not need to repeat it or make a long description of our history of permanent struggle against imperialism and its lackeys.</p>

<p>I believe that our history is clearly divided between Popular Movement and Oligarchic Thinking. Oligarchy, thought of in terms of the ideology of those who conceive themselves with almost divine right, superior, destined by the belief that they are inherently deserving of privileges... "entitlement" is the word in English.</p>

<p>Popular Movement, which summarizes the struggles of our people throughout history for social justice, well-being, independence, sovereignty and self-determination.</p>

<p>In these difficult and confusing times, you either assume the oligarchic, elitist, exclusionary and racist thinking, which does whatever it takes to maintain its privileges and power, including allying itself with and being facilitators, enablers of Yankee and European imperialist intervention and interference. Capable of murdering the people and destroying their achievements, for their petty interests.</p>

<p>Or you accompany the Popular Movement, which inherits the best of the struggle of our people. Which in the midst of all the difficulties imposed has managed to forge a path to build well-being and defend rights.</p>

<p>You are either with the Popular Movement, the Popular Revolution that builds prosperity and defends the rights of all: women, indigenous, Afro-descendants, peasants, workers, poor students, among others, or you are with those who destroy the dreams of the people, those who inherited from the colony the thought or the act of surrender, abject, subordinate to imperial interests. They cannot love the people, they only know to use the people.</p>

<p>There are no half measures. Here we are. We are the Popular Movement, expressed in the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers,</p>

<p>In this meeting, we remember, we celebrate, we thank you for your firmness, your constancy, your permanence on the side of the Popular Movement, on the side of the Sandinista Popular Revolution.<br />
<br />
This is the best tribute to Tonio, to Berndt, to Jacinto and to so many brothers and sisters who offered their lives, their efforts, their pain, their fatigue, their joys, their work, their solidarity with the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>With much love. With much gratitude. We continue building the Revolution.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
