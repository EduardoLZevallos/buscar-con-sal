&nbsp;<br>
Nicaragua's voters in November 9th's municipal elections were
the victims of grotesque election fraud, prepared well in advance and
predictably consummated, once the voting stations closed. The
perpetrators and protagonists were the losing opposition
Partido Liberal Constitucionalista (PLC) and their social democrat
allies in the Movimiento Renovador Sandinista (MRS). These political
forces were vigorously and unconditionally supported in their fraud by
the nationally dominant anti-Sandinista local media and their allies in
the international corporate main stream media.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The fraud had two main aspects. Firstly, voters were led to
believe the PLC lost all but 37 of the 146 municipalities voting
because the victorious Sandinista-led Unida Nicaragua Triunfa coalition
rigged the count. In fact, the PLC lost so categorically mainly because
Sandinista local authorities have done a better job on the whole than
PLC led local authorities. But the PLC also lost so definitively
because,<a href="mora-arce.html">
as leading FSLN figure Bayardo Arce has pointed out</a> the party
was racked by an internal power struggle. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The bitter enmity between PLC caudillo Arnoldo Alemán and the
US embassy backed PLC candidate for Managua, Eduardo Montealegre,
stripped candidates aligned with Montealegre - 50% of the PLC slate -
of campaigning resources and support. Nicaraguan analysts on both the
right and the left tend to agree that the PLC's disastrous performance
in the municipal elections resulted perhaps in large part from that
conflict. But it was hidden from voters behind a fake display of unity
that failed to mobilise PLC voters on election day.<br>

<td>That internal fraud - claiming the vote count was
rigged
when the PLC leadership had deliberately used a policy of neglect and
dumb insolence to undermine Eduardo Montealegre - was compounded by an
international fraud coordinated by the PLC's social democrat allies in
the Movimiento Renovador Sandinista. Earlier this year MRS leader Dora
Maria Tellez campaigned to prevent the party losing its legal status.
That outcome resulted from a complaint by the PLC leader, Wilfredo
Navarro, to the electoral authorities that the MRS was illegally
constituted.</td>

<br>
Then when it came to the election campaign the MRS did a
complete about-face by openly allying itself with the PLC, the very
party that had set out to strip the MRS of its legality. MRS leaders
Dora Maria Tellez and Edmundo Jarquin publicly called on their party's
supporters to vote for the PLC candidate in Managua, Eduardo
Montealegre. Dora Maria Tellez has even appeared in public events with
Eduardo Montealegre. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The crucial MRS contribution to the grotesque
election fraud they and their right-wing allies have tried to carry out
in Nicaragua has been their abiding influence in mobilising already
highly prejudiced anti-sandinista opinion in the international
corporate media. Leading MRS figures like Sergio Ramirez, Gioconda
Belli, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, and Dora Maria Tellez have exploited
long standing personal friendships with leading writers, academics and
journalists in the Americas and in Europe to project their minority
views as if they represented a significant body of opinion in
Nicaragua, which they do not. Their alliance with the PLC shows they
now have to piggy back politically in Nicaragua via alliances with
right wing politicians they themselves have denounced as corrupt. <br>
<br>
International corporate media, over-influenced by relentless MRS
propaganda, unanimously condemned the Sandinistas for the disturbing
violence that occurred in Managua and León and elsewhere following the
elections. But none of the reports seem to acknowledge that it was
violent PLC supporters who provoked a mass response from supporters for
the sandinista FSLN government. The most serious individual incident
occurred when <a href="http://nuevaya.com.ni/index.php/2008111329657/Noticias-de-Portada/Vil-ataque-contra-Tu-Nueva-Radio-Ya-periodista-es-acuchillado-y-camioneta-es-quemada.html">PLC
thugs pulled a Sandinista journalist from his vehicle
beat and stabbed him,</a> set light to his vehicle and then tried
to throw
him back inside the burning vehicle. Shamefully, that incident was
ignored in the corporate international media's reports.<br>
<br>
The incompetence and deceit of reporting on the elections can most
clearly be seen in reports like that of the Independent's John Carlin.
Carlin, in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nicaragua-betrayal-of-the-revolution-1028262.html">a
fine example of biased editorial opinion dressed up as
reporting</a>, wrote "Mr Ortega prevented international observers
from
overseeing the elections and ensured that the Supreme Electoral Council
was entirely in Sandinista hands."<br>
<br>
Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council is composed of the same seven
magistrates who oversaw the PLC presidential election victory in 2001.
The same individuals also oversaw the municipal elections won
overwhelmingly by the FSLN in 2004 and the FSLN presidential election
victory in 2006. The Nicaraguan right-wing parties accepted those
elections without demurral. <br>
<br>
The Supreme Electoral Council is an independent power of the State,
quite separate from the judiciary, the executive and the legislature.
Currently it is composed of three magistrates nominated by the PLC,
three by the FSLN and its president, who is not identified with either
party. One of the PLC magistrates, Rene Herrera, is a close adviser of
PLC leader Arnoldo Aleman.<br>
<br>
Carlin's ignorant falsehood has been repeated by other international
corporate media. It is doubly false since the Supreme Electoral
Council, apart from being independent of the government, did invite
election observers from all over Latin America. Around 150 elections
observers monitored the elections and agreed they were well-organized,
free and fair. These were professional electoral specialists from the
Protocolo de Tikal group, the Protocolo de Quito group and the Council
of Latin American Electoral Experts. Together they represented
observers from the electoral authorities of around a dozen Latin
American countries.<br>
<br>
Both Eduardo Montealegre and his MRS allies like Dora Maria Tellez
campaigned as if they were facing a national rather than a municipal
election. The slogan they used was "todos contra Ortega" - everyone
against Ortega. Daniel Ortega is Nicaragua's President leading
the&nbsp;country's current FSLN government. The slogan echoed the
MRS
slogan
"Ortega y Somoza son la misma cosa" - Ortega and Somoza are the same
thing. The bizarre slogan suggests quite irrationally that there is no
difference between the successful socially-oriented programmes of
Daniel Ortega's government and the murderous greed of Nicaragua's
former dictator Anastasio Somoza.<br>
<br>
By transferring their irrational hatred of Daniel Ortega to what should
have been a locally focused PLC campaign mobilising around issues
relevant to the municipal elections, the MRS helped seal the fate of an
opposition already seriously weakened by internal divisions. They have
tried to cover up their politcally catastrophic failure with baseless
allegations of fraud which have been contradicted categorically by
authoritative international observers. There was indeed grotesque fraud
involved in Nicaragua's municipal
elections. Its perpetrators were Nicaragua's opposition parties
desperately trying to cover up their own political suicide.</td>
