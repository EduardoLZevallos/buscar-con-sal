Vice President of Nicaragua, with the Delegation from Venezuela<br />
<br />
April 22, 2022</b></h3>

<div class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="458"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="252" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zbNFl2HoEA" width="448"></iframe></div>

<p>Brother and sister Nicaraguans, Nicaraguan Families, we have concluded this meeting with the delegation of the sisters and brothers of the land of Bolívar, the Land of Eternal Comandante Hugo Chávez, a delegation representing that heroic People, and naturally its President, Nicolás Maduro.<br />
<br />
He has sent this delegation headed by Compañero Félix Plasencia, Chancellor of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; Compañero Rander Peña, vice-Chancellor of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; beloved Ambassador in Nicaragua of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Javier Arrúe; Compañero Alcides Robles, Director of the Office of the Chancellor; the CompañeroYolimar Villalba, Director of the Office of the Chancellor; Compañera Mayira Garmendia, Coordinator of Cooperation; CompañeroAnsonith Albano, of the Embassy of Venezuela. Here we have Compañera Jessy, Compañero Gabriel and Compañero Nestor Rosales, from the Foreign Ministry Team that has arrived here with Chancellor Plasencia.<br />
<br />
This is a message that our People are giving, the message that we continue to strive for Peace, which is our fundamental Principle. And to strive for Peace is to strive for the life of our Peoples, it is to strive for the stability of our Peoples, working to strengthen relations in all spheres.<br />
<br />
We are fraternal Peoples by our history, fraternal Peoples in ALBA, and fraternal Peoples in the struggle to defend the Sovereignty of our Peoples. We are brothers and sisters confronting imperialism, an imperialism which every day causes more damage, more pain on our Planet. But beyond the implications of the force of imperialism, the power of imperialism, lies the strength and the power of our Peoples, who have been able to overcome the greatest challenges and have managed to defeat those who have tried to dominate our Peoples.<br />
<br />
And this is a visit where we are working together, Nicaragua-Venezuela, of course along with the sisters and brothers who also participate in ALBA and in the different integration Initiatives that we are developing for Latin American and Caribbean Unity.<br />
<br />
They arrived yesterday and have been working yesterday and today, and have met with colleagues from different institutions, with the mandate to set about re-launching the Projects that we were already leading and that we are looking now, under new circumstances, to strengthen, to create new mechanisms, to reinforce our relations in the framework of trade, culture, health care, in all areas, sport, the arts, productive activities, businesses.<br />
<br />
In other words, this is an exchange allowing us to strengthen all those initiatives that we are developing in both countries, under the new conditions the World is experiencing; housing construction for families, tourism; that is to say, really, so many activities, aquatic transport, land transport, water transport because we depend on that lot.<br />
<br />
Here we have already carried out activities of transporting even live cattle, from El Rama, setting out through the Caribbean, via Bluefields, via El Bluff, and then heading towards the ports of Venezuela. That route is one that was opened up thanks to the Bolivarian Revolution and the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution in the last elections. That's how this route opened up. And how many other routes and new routes we are going to develop, going to open up, so as to bring our Peoples closer together, attending of course to the demands of our Peoples for well-being, for a dignified life, for a full life, and above all secure and at Peace.<br />
<br />
So looking also at areas of security, transferring, exchanging on how to strengthen our security mechanisms, carrying out exchanges in that field, where we have a lot of experience, and you too also have a lot of experience, dealing with drugs trafficking and organized crime.<br />
<br />
In other words, these in summary are the issues on our agenda that the Chancellor will explain more, and that we will embody in actions, programs, projects, and this meeting will then go on to specify in more detail what today we have been discussing and planning for a better future for our Peoples, defending Peace and the life of our Peoples.<br />
<br />
Our greetings to President Nicolás Maduro, to Cilia, to Compañera Vice President Delcy. Indeed, we always accompany them in all the turmoil of these struggles. We look on the Venezuelan People, the Bolivarian People as one always making its way with dignity, defending with dignity their dreams, the dreams of Bolívar, the dreams of Chávez, making them come true.<br />
<br />
So I leave you here, Nicaraguan sisters and brothers, with the Foreign Minister of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Comrade Felix Plasencia.<br />
<br />
<b>Remarks of Compañero Félix Plasencia</b><br />
<br />
President Comandante, Vice-President, Chancellor, Compañeras, Compañeros, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
We are here in Nicaragua out of that commitment we have, both Sandinista and Bolivarian, to build the Great Nation, to bring dignity with our efforts, committed to bringing dignity to the lives of our citizens.<br />
<br />
From Venezuela, from Nicaragua, from here we offer our example to the other fraternal Countries of the Caribbean, of Central America, South America, of our multilateral mission and our international commitment to defend the rights of the Peoples, in these forums which we now have, forums in which we and our voices are respected and heard.<br />
<br />
Today, over the last few days that we have been here, where we feel in our house, in our home, we have gone over issues of common interest, confirming the way ahead, committed to follow the signs to our future, to meet again in the Third Joint Committee so as to ratify our historic endeavor of many years standing, one that continues to be current, namely the Bolivarian Revolution, the Sandinista Revolution, by means of a series of documents covering energy, health care, education, agri-food, defence and security, training, connectivity, and infrastructure. These are all matters of interest to us, which we have reviewed today with your team, with your Ministers.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, President, Vice President, Chancellor, for making that possible, and for your professional, serious, especially important work, carried out with a sense of responsibility that we have agreed and where we place the Citizen at the center of all our commitment and effort.<br />
<br />
That is what we are working out in practice and I think that today we took a big step towards realizing this commitment of yours, of President Nicolás Maduro, a commitment that it is also the continuation of the way Comandante Hugo Chávez mapped out for us.<br />
<br />
Soon we will soon hold the Third Joint Committee in Nicaragua, as you have noted, as you have communicated by inviting us, and there, with all certainty, we will sign all those agreements, those conventions, those mechanisms of rapprochement, integration, confirmation of that commitment of ours that is genuine, deep, typical of and very much part of ALBA-TCP and part of our historical commitment through PETROCARIBE, and which emphasizes our commitment to cooperation, solidarity and union.<br />
<br />
Thus, President, I have nothing more to add except to thank you for your hospitality and affection, Vice President, Chancellor, Compañeros, Compañeras. We return to Caracas very happy, to be able to inform President Nicolás Maduro and the Venezuelan people that the commitment of Union with Nicaragua is sincere, deep and increasingly strong.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, President, on behalf of our working delegation, our professionals, our Ambassador, our Vice Minister Rander Peña; we are very grateful and highly convinced by the achievements of this work that we are sharing today for our Peoples and in our commitment to all fraternal Peoples. Thank you, President.<br />
