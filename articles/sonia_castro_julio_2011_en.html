            <br>
            TcS : How important has ALBA been for the programmes of
            Nicaragua Health Ministry?<br>
            <br>
            Minister Sonia Castro: ALBA's regional project has been of
            great importance in particular in Nicaragua because it show
            how governments can unite in a solidarity-based way so as to
            improve the lives of their peoples. Here in Nicaragua and
            particularly for this Ministry ALBA has helped us get high
            technology equipment that had never been available in
            Nicaragua before so as to cut the cost of a cat scan from
            around US$600 to nothing, not even one c&oacute;rdoba.
            Because our starting point is a free service, something that
            helps the population and also give hope to people who have
            health problems.<br>
            <br>
            Via ALBA we have managed to build two high technology
            centres, the Lenin Fonseca in Managua and one in
            Estel&iacute; where we can now do cat scans that weren't
            done previously and we can now say that hundreds of
            procedures are carried out for the population each month for
            free. Now we are giving people the chance of getting their
            illness, their pathology better diagnosed, above all people
            with cancer so we can check whether there is metastasis
            taking place in other parts of their body.<br>
            <br>
            The ALBA project has also meant that mobile consulting units
            became available to the Ministry&nbsp; allowing us to bring
            health care units to remote communities and places. And that
            cuts the gap and improves people's access to health
            services. These mobile units include ultrasound, dentistry
            facilities, gynaecological services and general medical
            care. So these mobile units go to very remote places
            difficult to travel from.<br>
            <br>
            But we can also say that in general ALBA lives up to its
            name in Nicaragua, it really is a dawning, a growing light
            of a future to come one of common well being and one can see
            that taking shape in the economic programmes. Because if one
            improves opportunities and economic possibilities for people
            one also improves their health. Our function is precisely to
            create the conditions for people, for individuals, for
            citizens, for women, men and children that allow them to
            increase their productive ability because a healthy body
            allows people to be more productive and to set out each day
            to improve things for their family, for their partners, for
            their children going to school.<br>
            <br>
            I think the effects of ALBA come from families well bring,
            creating better conditions for people and that is what we
            are seeing. Right now we can say Nicaragua is seeing results
            by having better health indicators. We have fewer infant
            deaths, fewer neonatal deaths. We have zero mortality from
            dengue fever at the moment this year thank God and the
            efforts of this government but also thanks to support from
            ALBA. We have better roads &#8211; all that has repercussions for
            the health of the population.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : Has Cuba technical cooperation played a part in the
            ALBA programmes?<br>
            <br>
            Sonia Castro: In the 1990s the Cubans were rejected here and
            that brotherly humanitarian aid was not taken advantage of
            until Comandante Ortega accepted it and the first
            psychological-pedagogical study for people with disability
            carried out in this country took place last year,
            demonstrating the good will and the human aspect of this
            group of friendly ALBA countries, of the solidarity typical
            of these countries because we all come from the same classes
            of working people and rural families united in seeking the
            common good for all of Latin America. <br>
            <br>
            In practice that study allowed us to reach out to all the
            Nicaraguan households where there are people with
            disability. And that project is continuing because now comes
            the stage of attending to the critical cases, what solution
            we can offer them, what response we can make to that person,
            how we deal with their problem now it has been diagnosed in
            the community.<br>
            <br>
            And at the same time we have the Mission Miracle programme
            which has been going for four and a half years now, having
            begun in 2007 and has now carried out more than 80,000
            ophthalmological procedures. I would say with complete
            confidence that one is talking about having saved the sight
            of over 80,000 people because people could not see because
            they had cataracts and we can say we gave them their life
            back and the hope of being able to carry on working and
            making a go of life, with optimism so as to make a better
            world for everybody.<br>
            <br>
            I think that is only possible thanks to these ALBA
            programmes with their solidarity based Christian and
            socialist character. And they are constant expressions of
            that which people see all the time and which the population
            is benefiting from. When someone has sight disability it
            affects not only the person concerned but their family too
            who have to care for them because they become dependent.<br>
            <br>
            By contrast, by returning them their sight, that person
            participates and that helps the whole family and the
            community. I think ALBA contributes to health care, to the
            community, to social transformation by way of values because
            ALBA also sustains educational programmes but above all the
            hope of being able to&nbsp; turn society into one of greater
            justice with equality for all.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : The President of the Central Bank has commented on the
            formation of the supranational company ALBA-Medicines. How
            important will that be for the Health Ministry?<br>
            <br>
            Sonia Castro: This is very important because historically
            our countries have been at the mercy of multinational
            corporations and although we are impoverished they take
            every advantage they can because for the multinationals teh
            objective is to get what they can from you, maximize their
            investment at any cost regardless of whom they affect.<br>
            <br>
            But ALBA's ethos of Christian solidarity has led it to set
            about creating ALBA-Medicines as a possible source for
            supplying at lower cost medicines that are bought on a
            massive scale by our countries and of course that will mean
            that we will be able to buy more medicines for the same
            amount we are paying now and that will help us serve our
            population better. Because that is the objective, ALBA
            embodies solidarity it embodies Christian behaviour and
            making the best use of our available resources so as to do
            more for people.<br>
            <br>
            So we have to find alternatives. ALBA-Medicines is a project
            under development to see what's possible to do, to compare
            the lists of medicines we might use in our different
            countries and where they might be produced, how best to
            market them at solidarity-based, Christian, humanitarian
            prices. As a government and as a Ministry we need to be part
            of that process and ensure that our procurement policy
            includes those medicines.In teh end people will benefit
            because they will have access to more medicines for the same
            price we pay now.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : A general comment?<br>
            <br>
            Sonia Castro: I think too that people in Nicaragua are
            showing confidence in ALBA and in President Daniel Ortega as
            a result of his good government. In this country it is the
            People who are President. The People take charge of their
            Projects and design them. We are protagonists but involve
            the community in an organized way so they too are part of
            solving problems. I think that is something very important
            to mention because if the People do not feel these
            programmes are important to them we won't be successful. But
            that is the style of our President's good government that
            obliges us in the government institutions to ensure that the
            community and individual citizens participate in solving our
            problems and furthermore monitor the correct administration
            of available resources.<br>
