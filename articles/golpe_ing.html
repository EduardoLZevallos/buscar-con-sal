<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Tegucigalpa June 28th 2009 : emotions, memories, reflections</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">by toni solo, June 29th 2009</span><br><br>Incredulity,
outrage, impotence &#8211; admiration for Manuel Zelaya, Patricia Rodas,
Carlos Enrique Reina, Luther Harry every single one of the Ministers
and functionaries of the legitimate government. As Hugo Chavez put it
so well, the emotions boil and surge through one's blood and nerves.
Total rejection of the usurper regime. Chavez called them &#8220;gorilettis&#8221;,
Rafael Correa calls them &#8220;pinochettis&#8221; after the usurping dictator in
Honduras, Micheletti, and the defunct Chilean tyrant Augusto Pinochet.<br><br>They
are fascists, odious and mediocre, full of hatred and rancour. Their
coup d'état is a sign of desperation. They dreaded the enormous &#8220;Yes!&#8221;
vote that was the most probable result of the consultative vote
scheduled for Sunday June 28th. They fear the people's voice &#8211; the
voice of the majority. So they had to make the consultative vote
impossible.<br><br>But the majority voice is less easily silenced than
in the past, even with the classic caveman coup plotters' tools &#8211; the
troops, the armoured cars, the helicopters, the snipers on the roof of
the Hotel Marriott, their bursts of automatic weapons fire and their
tear gas. An idea can be gauged of the response of people in Honduras
from these recordings taken outside the main gate of the Casa
Presidencial in Tegucigalpa<br><br>A group of international observers
were invited by the Honduran Foreign Ministry to be present during the
Cuarta Urna (Fourth Ballot-box) consultative poll. It is called the
Cuarta Urna because, to the three ballots for President, for
parliamentary representatives and for municipal authorities, a fourth
ballot would be added. That fourth ballot would permit the people of
Honduras to vote in principle on whether or not they would like to hold
a Constituent Assembly. The pinochettis in the National Congress had
accused President Manuel Zelaya of the &#8220;crime&#8221; of consulting the
people. In fact the troglodyte legislators in Honduras had themselves
approved the Citizens' Participation Law, which says in its Article 5:<br><br>&#8220;The
citizens' initiative is a participatory mechanism by means of which
citizens will be able to present the following petitions or initiatives:<br><br>1.
Ask for the functionaries of public bodies or dependencies in any of
the State Powers to convoke the citizenry in general, the residents of
a neighbourhood or a district or a municipality, or organized social
groups, organized labour or sectors, to issue opinions and formulate
proposals to resolve collective problems that affect them. The results
will not be binding but will indeed serve as opinions to be taken into
account in the practice of the convoking body; and<br><br>2. Offer to
cooperate with the public authorities in carrying out some public work
or the provision of some service, contributing for that purpose
financial, resources, materials or personal labor for the benefit of
the community or the State. The competent public body, in accordance
with its available finances, will be able to contribute resources to
assist in the carrying out of works or, in their stead, to make a
public appeal so that other citizens, companies or social groups might
collaborate in carrying out of the relevant task.<br><br>These
citizen's initiatives will be able to be presented not just by citizens
individually, but also by civil associations, employers groups,
businesses, labour groupings or any other organized social group.&#8221;<br><br>The absurd self-exculpating arguments of the coup plotters collapse, once one considers this law that they themselves approved.<br><br>In
a Press conference on the evening of June 27th, President Zelaya gave
the reasons for the consultative process. He explained that in order to
develop a participatory democratic process it is necessary to consult
the Honduran people. He persistently emphasized the absolute priority
of consultation and dialogue. He explained that the current
Constitution of the Honduran Republic contains clauses that obstruct
consultations with the people of the country in important matters
relating to the country's economy and politics and for the development
of Honduran society.<br><br>As President Zelaya stopped speaking at the
press conference, the US ambassador got up, made a quick gesture of
acknowledgment to the President and left, walking quickly out of the
auditorium there in the President's residence. Maybe he was off in such
a hurry to read his children some bedtime stories. Or perhaps he was
off to finish preparations for the following days events with his
colleagues and the pinochettis.<br><br>Something one has to consider
with the declarations of Barack Obama &#8211; so expert at talking from both
sides of his mouth at once &#8211; is that only five months remain until the
national elections of November 29th in Honduras. Obama will talk about
the need for dialogue and negotiation &#8211; anything to delay and waste
time until his administration can recognize a newly elected government.
The most likely outcome will be a government all too ready to ratify
the illegal acts of the current usurper pinochetti regime. The closest
US allies, world champion hypocrites, the Europeans, will probably do
the same.<br><br>This coup d'etat is aimed not just at making
democratic change impossible in Honduras. It is aimed against the whole
integration process and against the decisive progressive political
processes under way now in Latin America. Specifically, it is a coup
aimed at the Bolivarian Alliance of the peoples of America &#8211; ALBA. <br><br>The
oligarchies and their imperialist patrons were unable to get their way
with Hugo Chávez. Nor could they with Evo Morales in Bolivia. They
could not get their way against Rafael Correa in Ecuador. Nor could
they outwit Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. They never even came close with
Fidel Castro and Cuba. Now the test is whether they can get their way
against the people of Honduras and their legitimate President Manuel
Zelaya.<br><br>The world will see now whether the North American and
European governments suspend their aid to the pinochetti regime as they
did to the most humanitarian and democratic government in Central
America, Nicaragua's. That will be the acid test of the sincerity of
all the declarations those rich countries&nbsp; make about their
supposedly unbreakable commitment to democracy.<br><br>Also, in the
June 27th press conference, President Zelaya debunked the false
accusations of a desire for re-election on his part. Even so, that
self-same accusation appeared in a report &#8211; based on output from the
Reuters disinformation agency &#8211; by the supposedly prestigious British
newspaper, The Guardian. The same day of the coup d'etat, The Guardian
report alleged that the objective of the consultative process was to
re-elect Manuel Zelaya as President. That report on the Guardian's web
site has been corrected now, after a fashion.<br><br>But the lie has been
spread internationally. And The Guardian will not have been alone in
that. The usual suspects will also have done their little bit of dirty
work, The New York Times, Le Monde, El Pais and all their even more
reactionary fellows&#8211; all the subtle and not so subtle misinformation
machinery of the mainstream corporate press and media. Manuel Zelaya
has always made it very clear that any Constituent Assembly that might
eventually result from the consultative process for what he calls the
Fourth Ballot- box would only happen during the period of government of
whoever may be elected in November this year. He cannot be a candidate
in that election.<br><br>After the press conference, President Zelaya met
that same evening with the group of invited observers &#8211; among them
Senators from Chile, trades unionists from California, politicians like
Eden Pastora of Nicaragua and Nidia Diaz from El Salvador, as well as
journalists and representatives of civil society groups. President
Zelaya explained the importance of the consultative process so as to be
able to initiate a process towards the possibility of asking the
Honduran people whether or not they might want to hold a Constituent
Assembly so as to change the country's Constitution written in 1982.<br><br>The
Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas went further and pointed out to the
group of observers the specific importance of theconsultative process
for some of the immutable clauses of the Constitution of 1982. The
Honduran oligarchy, traitors to their own country &#8211; interpret the mere
suggestion of changing those clauses as high treason. For that reason,
Patricia Rodas told us, on June 22nd she received in her office court
injunctions threatening her with legal proceedings if she carried on
organizing the consultative process for a Fourth Ballot-box.<br><br>While
President Zelaya was talking to the group of observers, it was possible
to ask Patricia Rodas why the Honduran opposition hated Zelaya so much
when he was so obviously a sincere and deeply serious person. Rodas
argued it was because a tiny elite used to power for so long deeply
fear the thought of having to take into account the voice of the
majority. That majority has resulted in almost 500,000 petitions asking
for a consultative process. President Zelaya opened up the way to make
that consultative process happen.<br><br>The oligarchy do not accept
it. They have seen what happens when the majority of a people get the
chance to make their voice heard. They have seen constituent assemblies
in Venezuela, in Bolivia and in Ecuador. They want to head off any
possible similar outcome in Honduras. Right now almost every government
in Latin America and the Caribbean have shown the firmest possible
solidarity with President Manuel Zelaya, with Foreign Minister Patricia
Rodas, with all their government team and with the Honduran people.<br><br>On
June 28th the members of the group of observers awoke to news of the
coup d'etat. From around 7.00am all communications were cut. A little
later the electricity was cut. Only mobile phones worked. By the
afternoon, all the government friendly media were shut down. We got
reports of the detention of various government Ministers, among them
Patricia Rodas. Other functionaries - like President Zelaya's
presidential secretary Carlos Enrique Reina or leaders like Andres
Pavón of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights in Honduras or
Rafael Alegría, a deputy for the Unidad Democrática political party &#8211;
were visible organizing the protest.<br><br>When the electricity came
on for a while in the afternoon, the media channels allied with the
coup plotters &#8211; the majority of the Honduran media &#8211; transmitted
cartoons or old films. When any news programme appeared it was
invariably to urge people to stay at home, to lull viewers and
listeners into thinking that all was calm. All information about the
developing protests in the streets of Tegucigalpa, of the police in the
northern town of Tocoa resisting military efforts to confiscate voting
papers and ballot boxes used in the consultative process, of many other
incidents &#8211; all that information was suppressed and censored. Outside
the Presidential residence several of us observers witnessed the
bravery and the determined pacific nature of the thousands of people
protesting against the coup d'etat.<br><br>The military watched
everyone from their helicopters, from the roof of the Hotel Marriott
and other strategic points. One could see that the military strategy
was to build up their forces prior to unleashing an assault against the
demonstrators. When a truck full of heavily armed soldiers tried to
drive up to the presidential residence, demonstrators blocked its path
with cars and taxis and mobbed the vehicle chanting slogans against the
coup. The truck duly turned around and drove off. They brought the
troops in by helicopter instead.<br><br>It may be worth reminding the
pinochetti coup leaders of Article Three of the Honduran Constitution,
&#8220;No one owes obedience to a usurper government nor to those who assume
public office or functions by armed force or using way and procedures
that violate or ignore what this Constitution and the laws establish.
The actions validated by such authorities are null. The people has the
right to take recourse to insurrection in defence of the constitutional
order.&#8221; It turned out that this clause also figured in the declaration
of the ALBA presidents.<br><br>At the moment, reports are coming in of army
battalions rebelling against the coup in the northern town of San Pedro
Sula, theindustrial centre of Honduras and also in Choluteca in the
south of the country. In Tegucigalpa and elsewhere hundreds of people
have been arrested including rural workers leader Rafael Alegría, many
journalists and also a couple of the invited observers from El
Salvador. Tegucigalpa's main hospital &#8211; the Hospital Escuela is full of
people wounded by the soldiers. Leading left wing politician Cesar Han
is rumoured to have been wounded when attacked by soldiers trying to
detain him. But he seems to have escaped, belying earlier reports that
he was shot dead.<br><br>Neighbouring Nicaragua has been the scene of
three major meetings to discuss the crisis. Manuel Zelaya participated
in all of them as the legitimate President of Honduras that he is. In
the morning the ALBA countries (Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba,
Dominica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, St. Vincent and the Grenadines
and Venezuela) met and uniformly condemned the coup in Honduras. The
ALBA countries agreed to arrest, for the gross breaches of
international law committed by the military under their control, any
member of the usurper government in Honduras entering their territory.<br><br>At
lunchtime the System for Central American Integration countries
(Belize, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras,&nbsp; Nicaragua, Panama) met and agreed for countries with
land borders adjoining Honduras to close all commercial transit in and
out of&nbsp; Honduras for an initial period of 48 hours. Then in the
afternoon the Rio Group which includes virtually all of Latin America
and the Caribbean, also met. The coup in Honduras was condemned by
every government present. <br><br>It remains to be seen what concrete
measures, if any, might be taken by the Rio Group countries against the
usurper government in Honduras. One dramatic announcement made was that
President Zelaya will go to Washington for meetings tomorrow June 30th
and on Thursday July 2nd will travel to Honduras together with the
General Secretary of the Organization of American States and a
delegation picked from the region's Presidents. Functionaries of the
legitimate Honduran government are working in clandestinity preparing
for President Zelaya's arrival. <br><br>Meanwhile the coup leaders
continue their repulsive work, suppressing free flows of information,
detaining people without trial, assaulting individuals trying to
protest against the coup. So far at least two people have been killed
by the military in Tegucigalpa with confused reports of casualties out
in the country's departments. Around the country many hundreds seem to
have been injured. As events develop, it seems more and more people
realize that this coup is going to fail. <br><br>Manuel Zelaya will
never give in nor will the majority of people in Honduras who support
him. Against a tough, genuine leader like Manuel Zelaya, Barack Obama
is going to have to rise to the occasion and acknowledge the coup
d'état instigated by his governments friends in Honduras. Otherwise, he
will be shown up more categorically than ever as the insincere
hypocrite so many people have long suspected that he is.<br></td>
