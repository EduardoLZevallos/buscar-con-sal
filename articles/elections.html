<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
If you believe what the Nicaraguan and international
corporate media say about the upcoming municipal elections you will be
outraged about the sorry state of the
country's electoral authority, the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE),
which, in cahoots with that beastly Daniel Ortega, is planning to trick
the Nicaraguan people out of their right to free and
transparent elections on Sunday (November 9). Luckily
though, the US
State Department, the European Union and a group of respectable
international figures have demonstrated their commitment to "democracy"
by speaking out against the "dictatorship," while back in Nicaragua the
"democratic" forces have joined together to make one big happy alliance
of freedom lovers ready to challenge the reign of terror imposed by the
Orteguista mobs, which are referred to for some reason as CPCs.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">If,
on the
other hand, you are an ordinary Nicaraguan from a marginalized
neighborhood or rural community you probably won't be paying much
attention to the media fanfares as you witness the same
preparations for the municipal elections taking place in the same way
as&nbsp;has done in previous years. You won't have noticed a decrease
in
your freedom of expression, nor will you have been terrorized by your
local Council of Citizen Power (CPC). In fact you might actually
have enjoyed discussing different problems within your community, or
your proposals for
your area, at a meeting
organized by your local CPC. But then you would be used to your reality
being mostly ignored and occasionally misrepresented by the corporate
media. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">November 9 - local elections or
mid-term
referendum?</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Local
elections will take place in 146 of Nicaragua's
153 municipalities on November 9. The slogan of &nbsp;the main opposition alliance, the PLC
Alliance,&nbsp; for its electoral campaign is "Todos Contra Ortega"
(Everyone Against Ortega), aptly illustrating the alliance's attempt to
turn the upcoming elections into a sort of mid-term referendum on the
FSLN government's administration, led by President Ortega. When
discussing the elections, the
alliance's candidates and their allies (in the national and
international media, in influential civil society organizations and
within other mechanisms of influence, submissive to the interests of
Western Bloc governments) return again and again to the need to stop
the "dictatorship" increasing its power. They insist on the urgent need
to prevent a return of "la noche oscura" (the dark night) of the 1980s.
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">To
a certain
extent the FSLN,&nbsp;which currently controls 87 of the country's
153
municipalities, has also adopted the idea that the upcoming elections
represent a mid-term referendum with candidates putting emphasis on the
assurance that Sandinista mayors will guarantee greater access to the
successful social programs coordinated by Central Government
institutions like Hambre Cero, (Zero Hunger,) Usura Cero, (Zero Usury,)
Casas para el Pueblo, (Houses for the People,) Calles para el Pueblo,
(Streets for the People,) Alimentos para el Pueblo, (Food for the
People,) etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">As
William
Grigsby Vado, political analyst and director of the
independent radio station La Primerísima, pointed out in <a href="http://radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/40617">his
political
commentary on October 28</a>, the insistence on converting the
local
elections into a mid-term referendum will probably turn out to be a
mistake for both parties, although it will have much more damaging
repercussions for the PLC:<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There is not going to be just
one election
[on November 9] ... but 146 elections, and the parameters are very
different to those of a national election. The electorate has other
priorities [which fall] within the traditionally predominant logic of
local concerns. ... The PLC has committed a grave political error. They
... [are] promoting an election to vote
against the government, and in particular, against President Ortega,
instead of an election in which to vote for their candidates or for
their policy proposals.<br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">There
are two
obvious and important reasons why the FSLN's treatment of
the upcoming elections as a mid-term referendum is likely not
to&nbsp;
prove
too damaging; firstly, the idea is not the main focus of the campaign,
the party is also putting a lot of effort into promoting
individual candidates and their proposals; and secondly, the idea that
FSLN led local governments would provide greater access to programs
which are beginning to make a difference to families and communities
around the country, is likely to appeal to many voters.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PLC Alliance&nbsp;campaign based on
fear for lack of policy proposals</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">It
is obvious
to independent observers of Nicaraguan political events over the last
few years that the main reason the PLC Alliance has based its campaign
around anti-Ortega feeling rather than the promotion of its proposals,
is simple. It does not have any policy proposals which are
simultaneously inspiring and realistic to
promote, something that has been made clear over and again during the
ongoing energy, food and financial crises and in the aftermath of
recent natural disasters. The Nicaraguan right, and the Latin American
right in general, is suffering a profound ideological and political
crisis, the origin of which is the failure of the financial and
commercial structures of global capitalism. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">One
only
needs to cast one's mind back to the last few months of former President
Enrique Bolaños' administration to be reminded of how the
Nicaraguan right has demonstrated its inability to fulfill its most
basic duties when in government. During Bolaños' administration
the pseudo free market, deregulated to perfection by over a decade of
neo liberal economic policies, was shown incapable of
guaranteeing electrical current to the country due to the rise in the
price of oil. During the second half of 2006 most areas were affected
by daily power cuts of up to fourteen hours a day. The Bolaños
Administration responded to the crisis, reducing working hours by half
for all government institutions in order to save energy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Within
a few
months of coming to power, amd despite the ongoing increases in the
price of oil, the Ortega Administration had significantly reduced the
length of the daily power cuts thanks to the government's signing of a
commercial agreement
with Venezuelan public oil company PDVSA, which today supplies most of
the
country's total oil consumption under extremely favourable payment
conditions. Within a year of taking office the FSLN government had
eliminated electricity rationing. The government has also managed to
secure several million dollar investments in small and medium scale
renewable energy generation plants in an
attempt to turn around the country's dependence on oil for 75% of its
energy generation by tapping into the country's massive potential for
renewable energy generation. This policy has paid off. In their first
eighteen
months of government Ortega and his team facilitated the generation of
more megawatts of energy from renewable sources than the three previous
governments did in 16 years.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Western Bloc powers do their bit
to
discredit FSLN government during campaign</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">So
without
credible policy alternatives to promote, the Nicaraguan right has
resorted to the resurrection of its age old fear-based rhetoric. In
doing so it has found the full support of the corporate media and
traditional
international allies.
While PLC alliance candidate for mayor of Managua, Eduardo Montealegre
(the multi millionaire banker accused of massive fraud against the
state) warns about an "uncertain future if Ortega
consolidates his dictatorship" (<a href="http://www.vamosconeduardo.org/vce/index.php/2008092987/ULTIMAS/PALABRAS-DE-EDUARDO-MONTEALEGRE-R.-CANDIDATO-A-ALCALDE-DE-MANAGUA.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">see full speech</span></a>)
representatives of the Western Bloc imperialist powers publicly condemn
the Nicaraguan government. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">In
the space
of three days at the end of October, <a href="http://radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/40178">three
damning
criticisms</a> of the FSLN government were issued by three
separate
bodies,
the European Union delegation in Managua, the US State Department and a
group of formerly influential right wing politicians from across the
American continent describing itself as a "group of friends of the
[Organization of American State's] Democratic Charter."<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">On
October 22
the EU delegation issued a statement expressing "concern" about the
government's "harassment of NGOs" after the Public Prosecutor's Office
opened an investigation into Ministry of Governance accusations that
seven out of the country's more than 4,000 NGOs are involved in
financial
operations which do not abide by the relevant Nicaraguan legislation
concerning NGOs. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">On
October 23
the US State Department Spokesperson Robert Wood read a statement in
which the "credibility" of the upcoming municipal elections "as an
expression of the will of
the Nicaraguan people" was questioned. The two main reasons given were
what was described as state
"interference" in NGOs and the cancellation of the legal personality of
two opposition parties. It is essential to note here that it has been
confirmed over and
again by official and independent sources, as well as by the European
Union delegation in Managua, that these two parties (the Sandinista
Renovation Movement, MRS and the Conservative Party) failed to meet the
legal prerequisites required of political parties by Nicaraguan law in
order to maintain their legal personality. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">On
October 24
a group of 17 former government officials of the Americas including
former US president Jimmy Carter, former Canadian prime minister Joe
Clark, former Brazilian president Fernando Cardoza and former vice
president of Nicaragua Sergio Ramírez, published a letter
expressing their "profound concern" about recent events in Nicaragua
which put in doubt the "development of a democratic electoral process"
in the upcoming local elections. Again the two main arguments were
based on the now infamous NGO case and the
cancellation of two opposition parties' legal status.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Finland reallocates US$2.5
million of aid</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">originally
for budget support </span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Ten
days
later on November 3 came the announcement that Finland had decided to
look
for an alternative destination inside Nicaragua for US$2.5 million of the
US$13 million it gives to the Nicaraguan government a year as part of
the Budget Support Group. According to Maria Luisa Balbini, adviser for
local development and governance at the Finnish Embassy in Managua, the
decision was based on the NGO case and the two opposition parties who
had their legal personalities canceled. As you can see, it is starting
to
sound a bit like a broken record, although Balbini also threw in the
false assertion that the electoral authority had refused to allow
electoral observers to take part in the electoral process, a completely false assertion
which is dealt with at the end of the article. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Although
Finland's announcement involves the reallocation (not the cancellation)
of what is a relatively insignificant amount of
money the corporate press and the political opposition pounced on
the story spinning it for all it was worth. The day the story broke El
Nuevo Diario (one of Nicaragua's two daily newspapers) ran the
dishonest front page headline "<a href="http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2008/11/03/nacionales/88665">Finland
cuts aid</a>." Later on the same day PLC Alliance candidate
Montealegre
took advantage of a meeting with university students broadcast by most
national TV networks during that evening's news programs to warn that
"Finland is just the first of many." <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">It
is
impossible to say how much of an effect this kind of multi-pronged
intimidation effort will have on the outcome of the November 9
elections. Although, following the logic mentioned above (that voters
will principally consider local issues and the candidate's
reputation within the community when deciding which party and who to
vote for), one might assume it will have a lesser effect than those
pulling strings behind the scenes would have hoped for. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">Why
fear-based rhetoric won't work this time <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">There
are
many
political, demographical, and historical factors which come together in
these elections to suggest that the right wing's fear based rhetoric
will be less effective than in previous years. First of all, the
suggestion that the FSLN government is a terrible dictatorship just
does not
coincide with the vast majority of the population's perception of the
Ortega administration. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Secondly,
because as a result of the last twenty months (since Ortega took
office) it has been demonstrated that an FSLN government does not mean
the introduction of rationing, military service or an end to family
remittances. In other words it is now clear for those who had fallen
victim of former scaremongering campaigns that the opposition were
basing
those campaigns on lies. <br>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Thirdly,
and
perhaps most importantly, over 50% of Nicaraguan voters are under the
age of 30 and therefore have no adult memory of the Contra war of the
1980s. The population's traumatic memories of the war have until now
been the principal tool used by imperialist and opposition forces to
scare the Nicaraguan population into voting against the FSLN. Today,
however, the tables have turned. Now it is the FSLN that is able to
invoke the population's collective traumatic memories of 16 years of
misery and abandonment as part of its electoral campaign.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Analysts
and
observers often refer to the unshakable loyalty of a large proportion
of Nicaraguan voters to the party (either Sandinista or Liberal) their
family has
traditionally supported. In most rural and many impoverished urban
areas the
population is thought of as being almost exclusively made up of
"Sandinista" or "Liberal"
families. [This is why it has proven very hard for smaller alternative
parties to make much progress outside the large urban centers (eg. the
MRS or Alternative for Change to mention just a few).] <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">In
the
upcoming local elections, however, the percentage of the vote the
liberal alliances have come to consider their own and on which their
strong presence in local governments across the country depends, may
well experience a significant drop as tens of thousands of
younger members of liberal families across the country vote against
their family's party. The reason for this possibility is simple: the
social programs brought in by the FSLN government over the last twenty
months make it much more difficult for liberal families to
continue to bequeath passion for their party to their children.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FSLN hope to win Managua in epoch
making
turnaround</span><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">One
of the
arguments used by political analysts who believe the FSLN will have a
tough time securing enough votes to win Managua, is that the FSLN
only managed to win control over the capital's local government because
the right wing was split. In <a href="http://www.nicaraguahoy.info/dir_cgi/topics.cgi?op=print_topic;cat=NoticiasGenerales;id=56488">recent
statements</a> quoted on the internet news outlet Informe
Pastran,
analyst Julio Lopez Campos added up the percentage of Managua's
population that voted against the FSLN in the 2000 and 2004 local
elections and the 2001 and 2006 presidential elections finding that
each time the total percentage of votes deposited for the right wing
was around 50% with the FSLN percentage of the vote standing
at around 36%. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">While
at
first this 14% disadvantage would appear difficult to overcome, one
should remind oneself that the current situation is very different to
the situation two years ago. In that sense Campos' argument can be
considered ahistorical, given that it does not take into account the
many factors, including those mentioned above, which favour the FSLN
going into the upcoming local elections. In Managua, like in the rest
of the country, the most important factor
which favours the FSLN is that it has been in government for the last
twenty months. And it is here that we discover the very essence of the
right wing's obsession about not losing power: the right wing know that
if they let the FSLN win one electoral victory, it will quickly create
the
conditions to win further victories.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">If
the FSLN
do secure a majority in Managua against the (almost completely) united
right wing forces represented by the PLC Alliance, it will represent an
epoch making moment for Nicaraguan politics and may well mean
the foundations have been laid for an FSLN victory in the
2011 presidential election.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Basing arguments on falsehoods,
opposition
predict fraud<br>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">As
mentioned
in the introduction to this article, the corporate media, based on
arguments presented by opposition politicians, claims that the FSLN and
the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) are planning to commit fraud. The
PLC Alliance's candidate for Vice Mayor Enrique Quiñonez
expressed his amazement and anger that the PLC representatives within
the CSE "have been so complacent with regards to the fraud being
concocted" within the institution. In a recent TV interview Dora
María Tellez (leader of the former Sandinista faction party the
MRS which has now allied itself with the PLC Alliance) said that the
FSLN is "doing everything it can to steal the elections." While former
vice president and influential right wing politician Antonio Lacayo
said recently that the President of the CSE Roberto Rivas has "ruined"
the institution. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">The
main
arguments being used to convince national and international onlookers
that Ortega and the electoral authorities are planning to commit fraud
on November 9 are that the CSE is not allowing electoral observation,
the CSE is refusing to give out cédulas (the identification
document required for voting) to liberal supporters, and that the CPCs
are intimidating opposition supporters so that they are too afraid to
turn up to voting stations on election day, all of which are based on varying degrees of falsehood. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">The
argument
that the CSE is not allowing observation is a blatantly untrue. The CSE has
accredited over 20 national and international electoral observation
groups including the Latin American Council of Electoral Experts
(CEELA) and the Central American and Caribbean Organizations of
Electoral Authorities (<a href="http://radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/40270">see
media report</a>).
What the opposition mean when they say the CSE has not approved any
electoral observers, is that they have not accredited the electoral
observers that <span style="font-style: italic;">the opposition</span>
want to
observe the elections, namely two civil society organizations IPADE and
Ethics and Transparency, both of which receive funds from the US
government and both of which have amply demonstrated on several occasions
that they do not comply with the legal requirement of neutrality. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">It
is true
that the municipal electoral council offices have failed to give out
thousands of cédulas in time for applicants to vote during the
elections. The idea that the local offices could somehow guess the
voting intentions of applicants for cédulas out of
the hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;applications is absurd. Sympathisers
of all parties are equally affected.&nbsp;It is much more likely
that the&nbsp;bureaucratic issuing system is imperfect and
underresourced.
Just ten days prior to the vote, the National Assembly had to vote an
extra US$35 million to the Supreme Electoral Council in order to
prevent the elections being cancelled altogether.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Meanwhile,
the claim that the CPCs are terrorizing liberal supporters is made
without any reference to the relevant context. There have been many
outbursts of incidental violence over the last few months but these
incidents have been carried out by both Sandinista and Liberal
perpetrators. Both Liberals and Sandinistas have been injured. The only
fatal victim was a Sandinista activist who was shot dead by a PLC
activist in Terrabona, a rural municipality in Matagalpa. <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">These
violent
incidents are indeed disturbing and distinguish this electoral campaign from
previous campaigns which have taken place under circumstances of
greater social calm. What the incidents demonstrate is that a small
number of both Sandinista and Liberal supporters are willing to resort
to violent intimidation. There is one fundamental and important
difference between the two parties' reactions to the incidents,
however. The FSLN leadership have repeatedly called for calm and have
not paraded "their" wounded on TV station. Meanwhile the main right
wing candidate Montealegre has appeared at press conferences with
wounded liberal activists in what appear like attempts to provoke
further outrage among supporters. On top of this a certain number of
representatives of the opposition forces have actually called on the
population to take up arms against the "dictatorship", for example MRS
leaders Dora María Tellez and Henry Ruiz (<a href="http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/33905">see
media
report</a>). <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">La
Primerisima's Director Grigsby believes that, conscious of its imminent
crushing defeat, the opposition forces are intent on discrediting both
the electoral process and its results. "With increasing frequency we
hear members of [the opposition] say 'the only way the FSLN can win is
by stealing the elections because everyone is opposed to the
dictatorship.'" (<a href="http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/40161">see
article</a>)<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">El
Nuevo Diario knowingly publishes inaccurate poll</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">As
part of
this attempt to discredit the elections, a poll was published by El
Nuevo Diario on October 22 giving Eduardo Montealegre a 10% lead over
FSLN candidate Alexis Argüello. Later in the day the academics
involved in designing the poll held <a href="http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2008/10/23/nacionales/87921">a
press conference</a> discarding the published poll's accuracy
given
that it only included interviewees from urban areas where the FSLN has
generally less support than it does in generally poorer rural and semi urban areas. According to the academics, the
newspaper had acted irresponsibly. Humberto Áviles, one of the
academics who took part in the press conference, said that the way in
which the newspaper published the poll "left a lot to think about."<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Ortega's
wife
and government spokesperson Rosario Murillo, speaking at the same press
conference, went further in denouncing the newspaper's actions saying
"the promoters of this poll ... aim to create a certain perception
among the general public so that, in the event of a different result,
the opposition can allege fraud." Indeed other polls suggest the
contest in Managua will be very close but that Argüello has a
slight lead.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">At
the same
press conference Murillo summed up why the FSLN believes it will claim
victory in the elections on Sunday: "while others wage this dirty war,
we are accompanying the people, from house to house, from family to
family, demonstrating our solidarity. [Ours] is the option that the
Nicaraguan people approve of and that will be demonstrated on November
9."&nbsp; <br>
