Americas Summit : <br>
Analysis of Obama's and Ortega's contrary
positions <br>
      <small><br>
by Karla Jacobs, April 24th 2009</small></big></div>
      <div class="arttext">
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 0, 51);">There is general consensus among</span>
progressive sectors in Latin America that last weekend's Summit of the
Americas, hosted by the government of Trinidad and Tobago, represented
a humiliating political defeat for the US government and its agenda for
the region. The final declaration (the product of
months of discussion coordinated by the Organization of American
States, OAS, in close consultation with policy advisers to former US
president
George W. Bush) was left unsigned due to irreconcilable
differences between the vision of the US delegation and its allies and
the vision of progressive leaders led by the ALBA</span><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"> (Bolivarian
Alternative for the People of Our America)</span><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"> block. What is more,</span><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"> a number of
regional leaders have since suggested that the Trinidad and Tobago
Summit is
likely to be the last regional summit organized by the OAS given the
irrelevance of the forum's antidemocratic structure and mechanisms
within today's Latin America where the revolutionary process continues
gaining unprecedented ground along the path to true independence. <br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">Even before the
summit began the ALBA countries (Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Nicaragua,
Honduras, Dominica and San Vicente) along with Ecuador had announced
their decision not to sign the document. The two main reasons given by
this block were the exclusion of Cuba from the regional forum and the
declaration's lack of viable solutions to the impact on the region of
the global economic crisis. During his appearance on Cuban TV's
political program <span style="font-style: italic;">Informative Round
Table</span> on April 22, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega revealed
that various ALBA country governments had proposed amendments to the
declaration in the months leading up to the summit but their
suggestions had not even been
discussed hence the regional block's decision not to sign.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Obama promises change but is unwilling to
deliver</span><br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">Prior to the summit
numerous analysts and commentators had coincided in the suggestion that
this high level encounter would reveal once and for all the depth of
the "change" President Barrack Obama assures us he is planning to
implement in terms of US relations with Latin America. Today those same
analysts have concluded that the kind of "change" Obama has is mind is
entirely superficial. Essentially, Obama's "change" is rhetorical: "We
can build a new future, but only if we move forward with a new sense of
partnership. ... I pledge to you that we seek an equal partnership. I
am here to launch a new chapter of engagement" (from Obama's address
during the inauguration of the summit). As Argentinian writer
Carlos Azn&aacute;rez says in <a
 href="http://www.alternativabolivariana.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=4308">an
article</a> written the day after the summit, Obama's amiable words
"mean nothing unless accompanied by concrete actions." <br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">The key issue on
which Latin American heads of state were pushing for and expecting
change was the US policy towards Cuba. There is unanimous consensus
among 33 of the 34 member governments of the OAS that Cuba should be
invited to join the regional forum and that the US should lift its
nearly fifty year long blockade against the Caribbean nation. Other
specific requests made by regional leaders were; support to deal with
the&nbsp; impact of the economic crisis;</span><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"> more funding for
the fight against drugs; </span><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">and commitments to
make US migration policy more humane and to provide funding to help
origin countries
reduce the poverty that leads to migration. <br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">Obama made no
announcement of any significance on any of these issues. According to
Azn&aacute;rez the US delegation's complete lack of commitment to any
real change in US policy on priority issues proves what left wing
commentators had suspected, "Obama is
just the face at the front of the Empire's subtle and intelligent
strategy of dropping the failed sticks and stones policy in order to
adopt a policy of sticks and carrots." <br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">As part of his above
mentioned appearance on Cuban TV's <span style="font-style: italic;">Informative
Round Table</span>
President Ortega gave his take on Obama's attempt to enchant the
region's leaders into submission: "[As I was listening to his speech] I
was saying to myself, he is trying to imitate the Pied Piper of Hamlin,
he expects all the rats and mice to skip along behind him - there we
all
go, off to the precipice, I said to myself. But he didn't achieve his
goal." </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Obama's call to forget past disagreements
rejected by regional leaders</span><br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">During his inaugural
speech, Obama put a lot of emphasis on his opinion that "in order to
move forward we cannot let ourselves be prisoners of past
disagreements. ... Too often an opportunity to build a fresh
partnership in the Americas has been undermined by stale debates ...
that would have us make a fake choice between rigid state run economies
or unbridled and unregulated capitalism, between blame for right wing
paramilitaries or left wing insurgents, between sticking to inflexible
policies with regards to Cuba or denying the full human rights that are
owed to the Cuban people. ... I did not come here to debate the past.
We must learn from history but not be trapped by it." <br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">Superficially
Obama's comments may appear measured and reconciliatory. </span><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">The continuity in
terms of unchanged US foreign policy for the region, however,
undermines any moral authority these words would at first appear to
inspire. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">With
this in mind, the underlying connotation many Latin American leaders
have drawn from Obama's proposal of forgetting past disagreements is
that his administration refuses to acknowledge the intricate and very
relevant ways in which the untold suffering US foreign policy has
inflicted on the region's peoples for over a century continues to the
dominate the day to day reality for the vast majority of citizens of
Latin America and the Caribbean. <br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">President Ortega
spoke about this aspect of Obama's speech during the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Informative Round Table</span> interview:
"We have a US President who says we should forget the past, but who
himself in trapped in the past, he is trapped in a 50 year long
blockade on Cuba. ... What was made clear at the summit is that the US
has not changed and that Latin America and the Caribbean has changed.
We have changed and are changing while remaining firmly anchored to the
roots of our history." <br>
      </span></p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;" dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">Ortega calls on
world leaders to develop alternative model to failed capitalism<br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">In his role as
President Pro Tempore of the Central American Integration System (SICA)
Ortega was one of the five heads of state that spoke during
the inauguration session of the Americas Summit. Despite being invited
to speak for just ten minutes Ortega gave a <a
 href="http://www.presidencia.gob.ni/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=202:comandante-daniel-ortega-en-v-cumbre-las-americas-trinidad-y-tobago&amp;catid=60:abril-2009&amp;Itemid=54">fifty
minute speech</a> taking
advantage of the space provided to communicate the position of the ALBA
countries as defined during the Cuman&aacute; Summit which came to an
end just a few hours before the opening of the Summit of the Americas.
Below is an abridged version of his speech including part of the
passages he cited from the Cuman&aacute; Declaration:<br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">"[Recently] the
leaders of the G20 declared that the crisis requires a global solution,
but they didn't take into account the developing countries when forming
that global solution. That is the reality. ... For this reason it is
important [for heads of state from around the world] to attend the
meeting that will take place in the UN [General Assembly] between June
1 - 3 so that [we are all present], instead of just the G20 leaders
debating the future of humanity. ... It is not correct ... that the G20
should go on taking the major decisions, that the G20 are the ones to
go on defining the destiny of our peoples. Therefore ... we must all go
to the UN to discuss, to debate, to contribute to the solution to the
crisis. <br>
      <br>
"During the heroic struggle to liberate India from English rule,
Mahatma Ghandi said 'England has used up a quarter of the planet's
resources in order to reach its current state of development - how many
resources would India need to reach the same level of development?'<br>
      </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">"In the 21st century
and during the last decades of the 20th century, it has not just been
England but all the developed capitalist nations who have established
their hegemony at the cost of the destruction of the planet and of the
human species. ... Therefore the only way to save the planet and [at
the same time] create sustainable development for humanity, will be
establishing the foundations for a new international economic, social
and political order that is truly just and democratic.<br>
      <br>
"During the ALBA summit in Cuman&aacute; we produced a document that
states:<br>
      </span></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;" dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">The heads of state
and of government of Bolivia, Dominicana, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Venezuela, member countries of ALBA, consider the project of the
Declaration of the V Summit of the Americas to be insufficient and
unacceptable for the following reasons:<br>
      </span></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">
        <li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">It
does not provide solutions to the global economic crisis despite the
fact that this crisis constitutes the biggest challenge that humanity
has faced in decades.&nbsp; </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">It
unjustifiably excludes Cuba, without mentioning the general consensus
that exists in the region condemning the blockade and the
isolation attempts which have been incessantly imposed on the Cuban
people and government in a criminal fashion.&nbsp; </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;" dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">Capitalism is
bringing an end to humanity and to the planet. The current crisis is a
systemic and structural crisis not just another cyclical crisis.
Capitalism has provoked the ecological crisis by subjecting conditions
necessary for the continuation of life on the planet to the
predominance of the market and of profit. <br>
      </span></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">The
global economic
crisis, climate change and the food and energy crises are products of
the decadence of capitalism which threatens to bring an end to the very
existence of life on our planet. In order to avoid such an outcome it
is necessary to develop an alternative model to the capitalist system;
a system based on solidarity and complementarity not on competition; a
system of harmony with our mother earth and not of looting of our
natural resources; a system of cultural diversity and not of the
crushing of cultures and imposition of cultural values and lifestyles
alien to the realities of our countries; a system of peace based on
social justice and not of imperialist policies and wars. In short, a
system that recuperates the human condition of our societies and
peoples
and does not reduce us to consumers or merchandise.</span><br>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"></span></div>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">"... We all want
change, but we have to agree what kind of change we want. Do we
want changes to maintain the status quo? Do we want changes ... that
save a model which has shown itself very good at accumulating wealth
and ... expanding poverty? ...<br>
      <br>
"We are no longer dealing with a matter of ideology, this is not a
political issue, it is a matter of survival! If they are set on
maintaining the model, if they are set on applying stop gap solutions
so as to go on sucking up the entire planet's resources, then the
future will be
the end of the human species. ... The only way of saving us all is to
change the model." <br>
