<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Beloved Nicaraguan Brothers and Sisters; beloved Families of this Land, of this Nation, of Liberty, of Justice, of Heroism, today we are commemorating the 37th Anniversary of the foundation of the DOEP, as the DOEP is popularly known.<br />
<br />
Justo Pastor, Chief of the DOEP, gave us a summary of a large part of the DOEP's operations and activities. And what is the DOEP's objective? The main objective of the DOEP, the main objective of the Armed Institutions of our country, the main objective of the State's Institutions, as we were saying, is Peace, to defend the Peace, Stability, Security, of all the Families of our Country.<br />
<br />
Beloved Compañera Rosario, Vice President of the Republic; beloved Brother President of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, Doctor Gustavo Porras. Yes, the National Assembly is an institution that is well established, well founded. It is decisive for the creation and development of the entire Nicaraguan State, of all the Armed Institutions of our country... Everything goes through the National Assembly! And it is proof of the solidity of our Democracy, of the respect we have for it and the authority of our Institutions.<br />
<br />
We salute the First Commissioner, our Brother Francisco Javier Díaz Madriz, Director General of the National Police; our Brother, Army General Julio César Avilés Castillo, Commander in Chief of the Nicaraguan Army. A few days ago we commemorated the 42nd Anniversary of the Founding of this Army of the People.<br />
<br />
Beloved Compañera Amelia Coronel Kinloch, Minister of the Interior; beloved Brothers, Commissioner General Ramón Antonio Avellán Medal, Deputy Director General of the National Police, and who put the discipline of the Police to the test, with the entire force that was in the Masaya Barracks, when during the terrorist onslaught, discipline was put to the test! How to resist, despite the bullets the terrorists were firing, how not to respond to that fire. It was a heroic feat, and it put to the test the discipline we have, a police force with a discipline that is proof against anything.<br />
<br />
Beloved Commissioner General Adolfo Joel Marenco Corea, Deputy Director General of the National Police. And during that time we were in communication with General Marenco, with all the compañeros, in those moments when that terrorist attack was taking place, and it really was terrorist!<br />
<br />
And beloved Brother Commissioner Justo Pastor Urbina, Chief of the Directorate of National Special Operations.<br />
<br />
Our Greetings to all the Special Guests to this Event. And our affection, our appreciation, our respect for the two compañeros who, representing our country's public markets, along with two compañeros who engage in other productive activities, presented an Award here, which shows how the DOEP is totally intertwined with the People.<br />
<br />
Its a rainy day, we are in the middle of the rainy season, and blessed is the rain that God has sent us, because quite simply, without water there is no Life, if there is no Water there is no productive activity. And so you see, there is a struggle in the world today, in defense of Water, not only the Waters of the Oceans, of the Seas, but also the Waters of the Rivers and the subterranean Waters that tend to be scarce and tend to be polluted, and hence the importance that we continue fighting for the defense of Water.<br />
<br />
Thank God we have a country with immense water reserves, lakes, two lakes, lagoons, rivers, streams, creeks, and we have to continue taking care of them. And that too is also the work of the DOEP, and also the work of the Army Brothers and Sisters with the detachment assigned to protecting the Forests, and to protect the Forests is to protect Water, to defend the Water.<br />
<br />
Such are the times that we are living through in the world and that we are living through here in Nicaragua, times in which the strength and faith of a people, of the Nicaraguan people, the strength and faith of the whole of humanity, are put to the test, facing enormous challenges.<br />
<br />
Poverty, which is the most dreadful pandemic in the world, because thousands and thousands and millions and millions and millions of Human Beings have perished and continue to perish from hunger. That is why there are those commitments on the part of International Organizations, such as the United Nations, that we have to fight against Poverty, but fighting against Poverty, I would say, is much more difficult than fighting against pandemics produced by bacteria, by viruses, pandemics and viruses that have caused millions of deaths in the World.<br />
<br />
Because in the face of pandemics, in the end, medicines are discovered, vaccines are discovered, and what was once a devastating pandemic, such as what was known as a kind of cold, a dengue, an Influenza, known as the Spanish Influenza, the Spanish Flu that caused millions of deaths, in the end a vaccine was discovered. Or Smallpox which caused millions of deaths, well, now there is a vaccine. Polio caused millions of deaths in children, the victims were boys and girls, but a vaccine against Polio was discovered.<br />
<br />
That is to say, vaccines against viruses have been discovered, but the vaccine against the virus that causes Poverty has not yet been discovered, because the virus that causes Poverty has to do with the insatiable appetite of those who accumulate wealth, turning even Health and Education into a business, making a business out of what are elementary Rights of the People: Health and Education, and they take advantage of pandemics to become more wealthy, they are happy when a pandemic comes, because they know they can sell more, and at a higher price.<br />
<br />
In other words, the most terrible virus that exists on the Planet is the one that causes Poverty, because it is in the genes of those who dominate the world economy, under Capitalism, which is based on the Principle that only the strongest survive and it does not matter how many dead get left along the way.<br />
<br />
That is Savage Capitalism "every man for himself", that is Savage Capitalism, which is the most terrible disease that the Planet suffers, the disease of selfishness, of an insatiable attitude to accumulate at any cost, even inventing wars to sell weapons, and whereby the military industry, the owners of the Companies that manufacture those weapons, sophisticated weapons, atomic weapons, are happy when they discover new weapons with destructive capacities, because they know that they will make more money. They do not care that they are manufacturing destructive weapons that kill millions of Human Beings, many more than these pandemics.<br />
<br />
Well, this Celebration, this Event, we are carrying out it in the middle of what has been called a pandemic and has already been classified as an epidemic; that is to say, the endemic, from pandemic, to endemic, which are the epidemics that occur year after year. But we have to vaccinate children every year, and adults as well, not only against this virus, but against all the viruses that threaten our population. And thank God we have a Health System that guarantees vaccination against the endemic epidemics that are out there.<br />
<br />
In other words, smallpox is always there, what is it that prevents it from reproducing and from producing a pandemic? Well, guaranteeing the vaccine. Polio is there, but what prevents Polio from killing thousands of children as it did here in Nicaragua? In fact, the Triumph of the Revolution enabled us to take on a commitment and a vaccination program against Poliomyelitis, which allowed us to eradicate that mortal disease of children.<br />
<br />
Now we are facing this virus, and we are managing to fight this battle with assurance, with faith in God, and in our own capacities and responsibilities, safeguarding, applying preventive measures. This is a preventive measure of all the troops here now, that they have their mask, that is a preventive measure, then, when they are in their homes they can take off their mask, when they are at a safe distance to be able to talk without the need of a mask.<br />
<br />
The vaccine is important, but the vaccine is the best business established in the world right now, and the big companies dedicated to the manufacture of medicines and in this case to the manufacture of the vaccine, can charge whatever they want because they will be paid by the countries that have the capacity to pay any price for the vaccine, namely the richest, most developed countries.<br />
<br />
But in fact, they know, the more developed countries know that leaving the vaccine only for a part of the world's population means leaving a door open for the virus to continue multiplying and reproducing itself in those same countries, because, as they say, the virus mutates. It may be that the mutated virus is less aggressive than the initial virus, but it always causes damage.<br />
<br />
We have managed to receive vaccines from Brother and Sister Peoples who have donated vaccines to us, and also we have to recognize, independently of any political or ideological differences, we have to recognize that there has been a contribution to a common fund, some countries contributing a little more, others a little less; a common fund in which those who have more wealth, those who have more capital should contribute more, but unfortunately do not.<br />
<br />
But, even with this attitude, everyone has contributed a little to the common fund, and this has allowed us to receive vaccines and to make progress in the vaccination of the population, taking into account, as we all know, that the first people to be protected with the vaccine are those who have serious diseases, so serious that the disease itself can lead them to death at any moment.</span><br />

<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">That may lead to their death, because in the midst of this situation, how many Nicaraguans have died of cardiac arrest, how many Nicaraguans have died of kidney problems. Because a citizen, an adult, a young citizen, who has kidney problems and has had to go to the extreme of undergoing dialysis three sessions a week and each session means risk of death, when that brother or sister enters dialysis, he or she knows and the family knows that he or she enters with life, but that the probabilities of returning dead are very high .<br />
<br />
How many Brothers, how many Sisters have died of cancer, and of course attention is more focused on this issue? How many children have died of multiple diseases that have nothing to do with the virus, because the virus does not attack children, it attacks adults.<br />
<br />
An adult person who has diabetes problems, who is on dialysis, has to be vaccinated, which does not mean that this guarantees that the diabetes problem has been solved. They are being protected so that the virus does not attack them, but those who are on dialysis are in a phase of more extreme risk to their life.<br />
<br />
These are situations that the Nicaraguan people have faced with great maturity, with great responsibility, aware that locking oneself away is like, as they say, burying one's head like an ostrich, and dying.<br />
<br />
The solution and it has been demonstrated in the countries that wanted to subdue, to force people, even imprisoning those who did not comply with the confinement, that was not the solution, but rather caused more deaths, and provoked intra-family problems when people were locked up in an apartment or locked up in their house.<br />
<br />
In other words, you have to know how to go out in the street, doing so carefully, you have to know how to go to work, doing so carefully; because, every day, even without an epidemic, if you do not go about with care you may die in an accident.<br />
<br />
How many deaths due to traffic accidents! How many deaths! Terrible! Children, young people, many young people dying in traffic accidents, adults. And yet the police make an enormous effort to control traffic, to make sure people do not speed, that they are not driving while drunk.<br />
<br />
On weekends the deployment is much greater, from Thursdays onward, because it is as if the people start going out more on Thursdays, so there is more deployment of the police to ensure people do not drive while drunk. And of course, the person who is stopped and the alcohol meter is applied, is already upset; but the fact is that their life and the lives of those in their vehicle are being protected.<br />
<br />
What has been decisive for us to be able to face this virus, this pandemic? The determining factor has been Stability, Peace. Let's imagine with this pandemic in a situation like that of April 2018.... Let's try imagining it! Peace is decisive and Peace is guaranteed by the State and its Institutions. Institutions such as the Police, the Army, Special Forces such as those of the DOEP, are decisive to ensure Peace and Stability, so that Families can feel safe to work, to go to work, for their children to go to school, to go to University, and suddenly they may have to study via virtual communication, and then they may come back again, that is, they make a temporary break in schools when they find cases, that is to say, preventive measures are taken.<br />
<br />
In other words, the Health System can work because we have a good Health System, but also because there is Peace, without Peace, without Stability, the Health System could not work.<br />
<br />
Let's remember what was happening with ambulances in 2018, the terrorists did not let ambulances pass. Let us remember what happened with the Health Centers, Health Posts, Hospitals that were set on fire by the terrorists.<br />
<br />
Or when the terrorists in suits and ties who commanded and paid the gang members to commit outrages and crimes, the terrorists in suits and ties, and the terrorists in cassocks, yes, the demons wearing cassocks, when a non-violent solution was being sought, when they had already bathed the country in blood, and had set citizens on fire, and in the Dialogue the issue was raised with the request, let this end, let the roadblocks be lifted, and who voted in favor of lifting the roadblocks? The Producers who accompanied the Government Delegation voted for it.<br />
<br />
And on the other side, those in suits and ties, those who received the money from the Empire and laundered that money to develop these terrorist activities, and those in cassocks, with no respect for God, with no respect for Christ, with no respect for the Virgin, calmly when it was said: Who's in favor of lifting the roadblocks? We the Government Delegation said yes with the Producers, with the Transport sector, they raised their hands, and on the other side the terrorists, when we asked, who's in favor of keeping the roadblocks? They raised their hands and defended the roadblocks, that is to say, it was simply chaos.<br />
<br />
They want to repeat history, they have wanted to repeat history, they were preparing to repeat history; but Justice is being done, that is all, Justice is being done, against the terrorists who were just instruments of the Empire, the Empire has even spoken up for a banker, speaking up for a banker who laundered money and sowed terror.<br />
<br />
That is why Peace is so important and that is why the Armed Institutions are so important to defend the Country's Sovereignty, because if there are no Armed Institutions enjoying the respect and affection of the People, defending the Sovereignty of the Country, at any moment then the Country can be subjected to an aggression.<br />
<br />
There are those in the Colombian Government who are talking about going back to the starting point, when the International Court of Justice has already pronounced and said, that the maritime delimitation imposed through force by Colombia on Nicaragua, that is not right, said the Court. And it was a trial, a process, and the Court said, all that territory belongs to Nicaragua, but now the Colombians are trying to back out.<br />
<br />
And all of us Nicaraguans have to be united on that. Who is going to sympathize with those from the Colombian government who do not want to recognize the Court's decision?<br />
<br />
Who will be in favor? The sell outs, the traitors, the terrorists, those are the ones who will sympathize They are not saying a word, Colombia is saying it openly, that they want former Presidents to meet up, they are talking about it publicly, appearing in their media, but we do not hear any of the devilish satanists here, we do not hear them talking about our Nation, talking about the Security of Nicaragua which is threatened when a Country like Colombia is talking about not recognizing the Judgment of the International Court of Justice.<br />
<br />
It is decisive, therefore, to recognize the role of the Armed Institutions in the defense of our Nation's right to exist as a Nation, which means that its Sovereignty must be respected.<br />
<br />
The respect of all Nicaraguans to be at Peace, to live in Peace, to be able to work, and to be able to work and get ahead even in the middle of a pandemic, such as this one we have been facing, along with other dramatic cases of Nicaraguan brothers and sisters who have died of multiple diseases, both adults, young people and children, or who have died and continue to die every day in traffic accidents.<br />
<br />
Nicaraguan brothers and sisters, Nicaraguan families, on this day we are recognizing a Force that is part of the National Police, the DOEP, that offers their lives, because this must be taken into account. To be a Soldier of the Army, to be a Soldier of the National Police, is to put your life at the disposal of the defense of the Nicaraguan Families and the defense of the Country, the defense of the Nation.<br />
<br />
We salute the Brothers and Sisters of the DOEP on your 37th Anniversary, we salute your Families, and we salute also the Families that accompany them and that recognize the work that you do for the Peace of all Nicaragua's Families, for the Peace of Nicaragua. And the DOEP will celebrate many more years, and we would say that the DOEP will continue with the same steadfastness, with the same commitment to Nicaragua's Families.<br />
<br />
And we say to you, Brothers and Sisters, continue, always serving the People, serving Nicaragua's Families. You are here to serve Nicaragua's Families, you are not here to be instruments of aggression against Nicaragua's Families, rather you are an Instrument of Peace for the Nicaraguan People.<br />
<br />
That is why we say to you on this day, Press On, Press Forward, Always, Always Further On as our General Sandino said; Always Further On serving the People, Always Further On  serving the country's Families, Aways Further On, serving Nicaragua.</span></p>

<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><b>Remarks by Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua,<br />
after the Central Celebration of the 37th Anniversary of the Directorate of Special Operations<br />
<br />
September 6th 2021</b></span><br />
<br />
<span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Today is Monday the 6th, and we almost could not hold the Celebration because it rained so hard. It seemed torrential, but it was really a heavy shower that lasted quite long, such that we thought it would not pass, and as these are times to take care of us all, we were worried about the number of compañeras and compañeros who would be in the Plaza, exposed to the rain, to 'flu, when we know what we should treasure is our Health... But thank God it stopped raining.<br />
<br />
Compañero Marcio Baca told us that after 5 o'clock it would stop raining, and I did not believe him, he said himself, Meteorologists are always wrong, but we too also make mistakes, because although we are not Meteorologists, we like to make forecasts.<br />
<br />
The good thing is that the Celebration was indeed able to take place, the good thing is that we were all able to recognize this Special Force that has defended Life, the Stability of our Families, the Security with which we can live, which means being able to work, study, prosper and make progress.<br />
<br />
How much we owe to our Police, to our Army...! How much we owe to this Special Forces Unit...! How many compañeros and compañeras gave their lives during the critical moments of hatred and terror, and how many were injured and wounded. What barbarity, what disrespect for Human Dignity, derived from terrorism and hatred, but as Comandante Daniel said, Justice is done. Justice may be late, but it comes.<br />
<br />
We truly feel we are living in other times now, times of Justice and Peace. Times of true Respect for Human Dignity. Times to encourage us all as Brothers and Sisters of Faith, the Faith that answers to Christ Jesus, that commands us to love one another, to love our Neighbor. That is our Faith, our Faith and Christian Fraternity.<br />
<br />
In the review that our Comandante Daniel made tonight, first of all we want to refer to those Health issues that he pointed out so well, as it should be, putting all the issues on the table: How Health depends on all the factors that make up our entire capacity, as Human Beings, to live actively, working but also with the right to enjoy Living as a Family, with Family Values, as we do live in our Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
And you see, there are multiple factors affecting Health in the world. Yesterday we were commenting with Doctor Gustavo Porras how this focus that we must put on the virus, on the pandemic, sometimes makes us neglect other things that impact our Health. Because, as Comandante Daniel said, there is an incidence of renal insufficiency, there is a lot of renal insufficiency in Nicaragua, and we have made progress with special programs, with more equipment to treat it, and also more awareness that it is a disease that must be treated. Because when you put on the scale what incurs more risk, should one go to get treatment for the renal failure, or not...? Obviously, the answer is that one must go.<br />
<br />
And there is heart disease; diabetes, which is also a chronic ailment; arthritis, which causes many people to remain almost without mobility, and diseases in children as well. Because we know that we come from years of lack of Christian Love, and that left us a lot of poor health consequences among children, and also a lot of problems that, thank God, we have been able to take care of, such as malnutrition.<br />
<br />
We are doing all the required censuses twice a year to see if we have improved, how we have improved, and what we must continue to do, so that Food Security figures as a factor ensuring child nutrition and development, and also promoting learning in our Schools.<br />
<br />
And as Comandante Daniel also said, the main thing with the vaccination which is Protective and Voluntary, because nobody is forced to attend the Vaccination Days, any of them, because we have vaccination for Influenza, as well as vaccination for all the diseases that used to afflict the child population.<br />
<br />
For example, we have vaccination for Meningitis, for example, which is another serious disease that was left here as a consequence of the years of darkness and lack of Human Dignity, of Respect for Human Dignity. And we address it, we seek to permanently raise awareness about the need to protect Children, to protect Adults; to take care of People with Disabilities with Special Programs to try to overcome those Disabilities that are surmountable. And to promote Respect furthermore for People with Disabilities.<br />
<br />
We have been making progress, we have managed to advance, despite these times of pandemic in the World. Doctor Porras also told me yesterday that PAHO/WHO a few days ago spoke of going from pandemic to endemic, which means that this is a virus that we have to live with, since never before in such a short time have vaccines been developed, there have always been years of tests to see if the vaccine worked and if it did not generate other side effects, but now in 8 months the vaccines were produced, because of haste, because of the urgency.<br />
<br />
Getting vaccinated is voluntary, but we are carrying out daily all the measures for Preventive Health Care, both our Citizens in general because we are a responsible, conscious People, and also via the Health Programs which help us enormously to face these times of pandemic.<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Health is delivering, in those places where outbreaks are detected, the necessary medicine is distributed for people who could be infected, their environment, their contacts, the people with whom they had contact; that is to say, it is a Journey that means in some places even going house to house, and then there are the calls made by the Ministry of Health Centers to those People who have returned after traveling in countries where there are many contagions.<br />
<br />
And we know, because we read it, we see it every day, we hear it, that in the so-called Developed Countries, there are many contagions, Countries that held us back us precisely because of their robbery of our Natural Resources, and their attempts at Domination, they delayed our development, subordinating it to their own Model.<br />
<br />
And we know that there are a lot of contagions there, that there is saturation in the Hospitals, but there are those who... terrorists, I always call them Health terrorists, they do not mention the problems that exist in other Countries. </span></p>

<p align="LEFT" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">We do not like to, because it is not our nature, neither to speak ill of anyone, nor to wish ill on anyone, unlike others who speak ill for pleasure, who lie, who are terrorists of Communication, with selfish political agendas.<br />
<br />
We do not like to speak ill of anyone, nor wish ill on anyone, that has been a Principle of our Lives. To serve, of course, with Love, those who need it, and we have done so. All these Health Programs do not distinguish, they do not discriminate. Saying no, not there, because there lives someone who is an opponent, or a family that was involved in the roadblocks, or a terrorist.... No, everyone has been cared for! We saw them getting vaccinated and they were guaranteed vaccination, and we also guaranteed that attention with the care that characterizes us as Christians.<br />
<br />
These are times to value what we have in our Nicaragua, because we are a People that trusts in God, a People that recognizes the natural Talent we have and our capacity for work, and all that God gives us as Blessings, to work, to study, to start a business, to prosper. And that, even in these Times, or especially in these Times, is a demonstration of the Spiritual Strength of our People: to take care of ourselves and to continue working, to take care of ourselves and to continue studying.<br />
<br />
UNESCO acknowledged that schools should not have been closed... We did not close them. And what kind of Campaign the terrorists mounted, and what kind of Campaign by those who call themselves Priests and who manage and make a business out of Schools they call Subsidized... A Campaign against keeping Schools open !<br />
<br />
These are Truths, not inventions, it is not terrorist communication we are doing, we are telling the Truth. Genuine Truth !<br />
<br />
May God help them repent of the damage they have done, the damage they have wanted to continue doing, may God allow them to repent, because repenting is a sign of Humanity and Spirituality.<br />
<br />
One cannot live wishing evil on others, hating others, terrorizing simple and good people, just for selfish political interests or a political agenda, without telling the truth of how things are in the countries they dream of reaching, those countries which they have financed them to promote terrorism and hatred, things are better there, according to them; while here in our small countries, according to them too, everything is in ruins. They need to look at the World again, because the World is not like that.<br />
<br />
Here we defend Peace, here we defend the Right of Nicaraguans to live in Peace, and we defend it even risking, giving our own Lives, as in the case of the Compañeras and Compañeros of our Police, of our Army, who have defended us, and that is indeed how we have felt, defended, and we have also felt moved and indignant when they have lost their Lives, murdered, because that is the word, so many Good People when all they did was to take care of the country's Families, the country's Communities, and to demonstrate their Love of the People and their Love of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
There are many things to cover, we see in so many message we receive from all the Institutions that truly work out of Love for our People, for our Nation, and without rest, covering the many issues of work, of development.... Houses that are being delivered all over the country... Streets that are being built... Work and sources of work... How Rural Producer Families are receiving Technologies, Strengths, Capacities, to improve their yields and income, and also to improve our Country's productive potential.<br />
<br />
Thank God we are a food producing country, that is a treasure. We would never want to be a country that produces bombs or atomic weapons, but much rather food, and food not only for our people, but also to be able to offer to other peoples in the international market, through international trade.<br />
<br />
We feel only gratitude to God, because we have recovered Peace, at the cost of the Lives of many good, invincible Children of Nicaragua. But Nicaragua's Families recognize that Heroism and that Sacrifice, and value, because we do value how Peace has grown, how Security has grown, how Stability has grown, and how we are walking under a Sun that illuminates us, that illuminates already New Victories, that Sun that does not set and, of course, is inspired, which means to have Spiritual sense, thanks to that God whose vision includes Respect for Human Dignity, and to promote the Respect for Human Dignity.<br />
<br />
Here we fulfill the life of Christ Jesus. Here we work for Dignity in the Life of everyone, without discrimination. And here we endeavor, we are not perfect, but we try, from the understanding that we have of the Value of Work, of the Value of the recognition of the effort of our Families, here we try to advance, feeling blessed, feeling prosperous, and knowing that every day is an immense Victory of the Common Good and that we advance towards more Victories with Strength of Spirit, that Character of ours, that Identity of ours, those Cultural and Natural Patrimonies of ours... Let's advance towards many more victories!<br />
<br />
Security, Stability and Peace are the keys for each Person, each Family, each Community to develop in plenitude their talents and capacities, so let's all work to make our Lives better, because that is what God wants: for our Lives to be better !<br />
<br />
So, Companeras and Compañeros, in these Times of Justice and Peace, in these Times of true Respect for Human Dignity, in these Times of Beneficent Lights, we feel God's Protection over all of us. Each one of us, with our personal effort, with our talent, with their intelligence, with all our intelligence, our sensibility, we are not, we do not know how to be indifferent, we do not see in other People what is not rightfully ours, instead we see our Neighbor and the Rights of the Neighbor.<br />
<br />
And this is how we move forward, as a Great Family, the Nicaraguan Family, that in this patriotic Month of the  Nation we recognize ourselves as more and more honorable, as more and more valuable, more and more brave, noble, knowing more and more how to discern that Love is stronger than Hate. Always, as long as we move forward with Love, we can reach the Times of Hope and Abundance that God Our Lord has in store for us.<br />
<br />
Many embraces to all the Compañeros and Compañeras of the DOEP, to their Families that support them.... Many embraces to the Families, to the Mothers, to the Fathers, to the Brothers and Sisters who have lost Loved Ones, those Loved Ones who are not only theirs in the sense that we Nicaraguans love them all too, because we carry them in our Hearts.<br />
<br />
We will never forget how they defended the Nation, how they gave their lives for the Nation, just as we will never forget the terrorist hatred that thanks be to God, in these new days of Peace and Goodness, is facing Justice. Because Justice comes from God, Justice comes from the Father, who calls us to live according to the Sacred Laws. He does not call us to kill one another, or to steal, or to lie, or to offend, He calls us to live with Love, and that is what we try to do, every day.<br />
<br />
Long live our Nicaragua! Days of Victories, Days of Justice, Days of this Nation, this Infinite Nation of us All, of All of us. This Nation that goes forward in Liberty, Dignity, Fraternity, and Prosperity. Thank you, Compañeros and Compañeras. </span></p>
