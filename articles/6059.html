<p><strong>LIGHT AND TRUTH</strong><br />
<br />
<em>“All of you feel a force superior to yourselves and to all the other forces of the Universe. This invisible force has many names, but we know it by the name of God.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Augusto C. Sandino<br />
General of Free Men and Women<br />
1931 - Las Segovias, Nicaragua</strong></em><br />
<br />
We pronounce for our part on Statements made on behalf of the Vatican State on their own web sites and platforms, Statements that constitute an insulting aggravation for the Sovereignty and Dignity of the Nicaraguan State.</p>

<p>According to the Constitution of our Republic, approved in 1893, and ratified with its Reforms this year 2025, the Nicaraguan State is secular and promotes respect for all Religious Creeds, without distinction or favor that might signify or oblige exclusive preference towards the Cults and Practices of the different Churches, some of which have accompanied the Nicaraguan People faithfully and loyally, in True Spirituality.</p>

<p>The Statements in question are irresponsible and disrespectful. They violate the supreme Laws and Norms which govern the Independent Life of our Blessed Nicaragua. In addition, having no supranational political authority, the Vatican State seeks to assign Positions and Powers that it purports to grant, in Nicaragua, to People who ceased to be Nicaraguans as a result of improper, intolerable behavior promoting politically instigated crimes, as well as constant calls to commit breaches of the Peace, with every kind of violence, falsehood and deliberate slander, inflicting anguish, suffering and pain, on the Families of our Country.</p>

<p>We condemn these unacceptable behaviors on the part of people who from narcissistic pulpits, disguised and masked in benevolence and pharisaic mystique, continue to attack the Nicaraguan People, with ridiculous, insolent, indecent claims to Political Power, because, while hidden behind fancy dress fantasy, their ultimately absurd claims are based on arbitrariness, falsehood and the desire to dominate in violation of all Rights.</p>

<p>These individuals have betrayed the Sacred Duty of all this Country’s Citizens to safeguard and preserve Sovereignty, Security, Peace and Dignified Employment for every Person.</p>

<p>From their vacuous pulpits and would-be thrones, these prophets and merchants of falsehood, know nothing of Christ nor of his Doctrines of Love and Concord, his Prophetic Legacy to Humanity, a Heritage of Hope and Dialogue, of Tolerant and Peaceful Coexistence among Brothers and Sisters.</p>

<p>The aforementioned unacceptable, anti-Christian behavior has deserved, and deserves still, the condemnation of Nicaragua’s Families and the Vatican State, which ought to obey the Norms of International Law, respecting National Governments and their Institutions, and has not the least authority to make appointments of any kind, in the Sovereign, Dignified Territory of our Nicaragua.</p>

<p>All such legally inadmissible conduct, thereby illicit and illegitimate, is considered offensive to the Dignity, Decorum and Freedoms of our People, who live, not just in accordance with Human Laws, but, above all, according to the principles, values and practices of True Christianity, the Certain Hope of millions, stemming, above all, from Love both for and of God.</p>

<p>The Nicaraguan People have defended their Sovereign and Peaceful Life with Sacred Blood and Honor over Centuries. The illegal and unwonted behavior of falsifiers, the Pharisees and Prophets of Nihilism, which we reject, differs in no way at all from behaviors and practices derived from Fascist, pro-imperialist Ideologies, which can never be admitted and accepted, much less applauded in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>From the Faith that characterizes and moves us, our most energetic protest against the affirmation of these unredeemed, stateless, destructive and ambitious individuals and too against the notional imposition of such despicable people as authorities whom no one recognizes or ever will recognize.</p>

<p>The history of abominable, perverse, inhuman tendencies and practices in accord with infamous colonialist Monarchies, incriminate that self-same Vatican State, which, usurping the Name of God, cut off heads, killing with the sword, exterminating entire Peoples and Cultures, condemning to death the languages and spiritual practices of Native Peoples, and brandishing weapons of all kinds so as to dominate, conquer and steal our rich Material and Cultural Heritages, which, furthermore, have materially supported the so-called Treasure of the Vatican Empire, magnanimous in nothing but very much guilty of crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>From the millions of Voices and Souls, brutally silenced by the Inquisition, of all the Peoples sacrificed and bled to death by that depraved, pedophile Vatican State, denounced like this all over the World, which in these Times still cannot recognize Virtues and Rights but instead allies with Forces of Darkness, barbarism, genocide and evil, to continue plundering our Sacred Dignities, Beliefs and Powers as well as our Material and Spiritual Riches, which in the zeal of usurpation they still fail to understand.</p>

<p>In the name of all the Martyrs, of all the Dead that the ignoble practices of the Vatican State have generated the whole world over, we demand Respect for Life, for Harmony, for the uplifted Conscience, and for that characteristic Sacred Spirituality, active, creative and belligerent of a People that Neither Sells Out, Nor Surrenders, Ever!</p>

<p>So be aware, gentlemen, that your immoral grotesque freaks, dressed up as pastors, will Neither Return, Nor Will They Pass!<br />
Of that Our Faith is Certain !</p>

<p>From our Christian, Socialist and Solidarity Inspired Nicaragua, we reaffirm everything we have said.</p>

<p>Always Further On!</p>
