beliefs have taken over United States and European public life to such
an extent that most political leaders in North America and Europe could
quite reasonably be certified mentally unfit to govern. Here is a
statement from senior US Senator, former presidential candidate, John
Kerry about Honduras :<br><br>"The June 28 coup, Mr. Micheletti&#8217;s
uncompromising power-grab, and the growing evidence of abuses of
authority--remarkably similar to those we have condemned by Venezuelan
strongman Hugo Chavez--cast a dark shadow over every aspect of
preparations for the elections scheduled for November."<br><br>The
statement is dated August 26th. Among what Kerry euphemistically calls
"abuses of authority" one finds gross human rights violations confirmed
even by the conservative Inter-American Human Rights Commission&nbsp;<a href="../tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/3087.html">in its preliminary report published on August 21st:<br></a><br>* the militarization of significant areas of civilian life;<br>* arbitrary and illegal application of State of Siege legislation;<br>* absence of judicial protections for citizens' fundamental rights;<br>* the militarization of peaceful demonstrations;<br>*
widespread use of disproportionate force against peaceful protests
causing serious physical injury to hundreds of demonstrators:<br>* the arbitrary detention of thousands of peaceful demonstrators:<br>* cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of those thousands of detainees;<br>* physical agression and threats by police and military against journalists covering opposition to the military coup. <br><br>John
Kerry is talking nonsense when he suggests that these abuses
are&nbsp;at all similar to anything that has happened In Venezuela
under the government of Hugo Chavez. Such circumstances did indeed
prevail very briefly in Venezuela in April 2002. They did so under the
short-lived, US supported&nbsp; coup regime of Pedro Carmona whose
first act was to suspend Venezuela's constitutional guarantees. <br><br>Senator
Kerry's false beliefs are those of someone regarded as a political
progressive in mainstream US politics. The sources of his and his
fellow Senators' false beliefs are corporate propaganda news outlets
that depend for the greater part of their information and analysis on
the US State Department and the US Department of Defence. The big news
agencies, Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Presse, the main US
and European news media all regularly recycle false beliefs as news.
Here are a few examples in relation to Latin America:<br><br>* Hugo Chavez is a anti-democratic, militarist tyrant;<br>* Alvaro Uribe is a vital partner in the US government's "war on drugs";<br>* the FARC are the main suppliers of cocaine to the United States;<br>* Cuba is a failed State;<br>* Mexico, Colombia and Perú are successful democratic States;<br>* the regional free trade agreement with the US has brought prosperity to Central America;<br>* Nicaragua's government is incompetent, corrupt and undemocratic;<br>* Iran is building a huge embassy in Managua;<br>* Honduran President Manuel Zelaya is an undemocratic leftist who unconstitutionally sought re-election;<br>* Venezuela destabilizes Latin America and the Caribbean via the ALBA alliance;<br>* United States regional policy respects sovereignty and promotes peace and democracy;<br>* the US government does not want bases or increased permanent military personnel in Colombia.<br><br>Every
single one of these beliefs as put forward either by US government
Walter Mitty functionaries, like Hillary Clinton, or by
endlessly-dementing corporate media, like the Wall Street Journal, is
completely false. But they form the basis for United States foreign
policy. They make up a kind of catechism for news media not just in the
US but in its allied countries too. The inevitable result is that
mainstream corporate news coverage of events in Latin America turns
into a kind of cathartic, orphic speaking-in-tongues that effectively
startles its audience into passive acquiescence.<br><br>In fact:<br><br>* since 1998 Hugo Chavez and his Venezuelan government have consistently won national elections with well over 50% of the vote;<br>* Alvaro Uribe has a long history of involvement in paramilitary and narcotics activities dating from the 1980s;<br>*&nbsp;just
one FARC member&nbsp;has been convicted on narcotics charges in the US
- on suspect evidence alleging conspiracy - while almost all Colombian
cocaine imported into the US&nbsp;is from areas controlled by the
Colombian government;<br>* as measured by the United Nations Human
Development Index, 50 years-blockaded Cuba is a more successful society
than NAFTA-beneficiary Mexico;<br>* Mexico, Colombia and Peru all have
notoriously unequal, extremely corrupt societies characterized by
fraudulent electoral processes, whose governments depend on brutal
security forces to repress widespread dissent;<br>* CAFTA has worsened trade imbalances between the region and the US, diminished government revenues, and accentuated inequality;<br>*
Nicaragua's government has spectacularly improved key health and
education indicators, including eradicating illiteracy, reactivated
agriculture, dramatically increased exports and increased citizen
participation in decision making;<br>* Iran is not building an embassy in Managua<br>* Manuel Zelaya is a centrist, reformist politician who respected the country's constitutional bar on re-election;<br>* Venezuela has helped provide food and energy security to over 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean;<br>*
the US government has needlessly reactivated its 4th fleet and, against
widespead regional opposition, is establishing a network of military
bases throughout Latin America and the Caribbean;<br>* most governments
in South America think the US government is blatantly lying about the
seven extra bases it now seeks to exploit in Colombia and for that very
reason demanded the right to inspect those bases.<br><br>Psychotic is
the adjective that best fits the amazing contrast between these
regional facts and the false beliefs advanced by the US authorities and
their propaganda outlets in the corporate media. The same psychotic,
talking-to-itself, delinquent quasi-reasoning drove the US economy into
its current financial crisis. That economic debacle is mirrored in the
US government's unfolding foreign policy debacle. <br><br>In foreign
policy the equivalent of the printing press and the ballooning Federal
Reserve balance sheet is militarist expansionism. The Federal Reserve
lies about and conceals what it is doing - promoting a huge shift in
wealth from the long-suffering US majority to a greedy elite - the same
way the State Department and the Pentagon lie about their respective
betrayals of the United States people. The United States has a failed
economy run by a deceitful government in tandem with a failed foreign
policy. A sharply inverse relationship is developing between the Obama
administration's domestic policy failure on the&nbsp;economy and its
increasing militarist aggression overseas. <br><br>The crisis in
Honduras has revealed categorically that presidential candidate
Yes-We-Can has turned decisively, in as much as anything a corporate
puppet does can be construed as decisive, into President No-I-can't. Up
until now, governments in Latin America have coped relatively well on
the whole with the results of the economic crisis provoked by rich
country corporate greed and political opportunism. Their main emerging
dilemma is how to cope with the dementing corporate gangsters in
control of President Obama's government who are determined to continue
the anti-American Bush regime nightmare and their global war against
humanity.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
