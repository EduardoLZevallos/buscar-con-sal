      <br>

Because their economic system has failed, the US government and its
allies are seeking to partially stem their relative decline by
exploiting their military might around the world. In Latin America they
are close to plunging Central America and the Andes into violent
conflict and possibly outright war. They have already created the &#8220;war
on terror&#8221; to criminalize domestic dissent and legitimate resistance overseas to
their ruthless attempts to stem their decline. They cannot
attack more important rivals like Russia or China with impunity, but
they can afford to foment aggression aimed at those countries' regional
allies like Iran and Venezuela.<br>

      <br>

Western Bloc countries &#8211; North America, Europe and their Pacific allies
- have supported Israel so as to attack Iran's local allies &#8211; Hezbollah
in Lebanon in 2006 and Hamas in Gaza in 2008. In Latin America now they
are following the same policy. They are using Alvaro Uribe's&nbsp;
narco-terror&nbsp; regime in Colombia to attack Venezuela. Shortly, in
Central America, they will probably use some illegitimate successor to
the current Honduran coup regime to facilitate violent destabilization
in Nicaragua and El Salvador.<br>
      <br>
Continuing the Bush regime's shift of US Latin America policy steadily
towards outright militarist aggression, the Obama administration
promotes every kind of low-intensity conflict provocation. The last
months of the Bush regime saw US-Colombian armed intervention in
Ecuador, the reactivation of the US Navy's Fourth Fleet, the US
supported Bolivian opposition's massacre of indigenous families in
Pando and false allegations by the US embassy-organized opposition in
Nicaragua of fraud in that country's municipal elections.<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: justify;">The first months of the Obama administration's sinister policy in Latin
America have been almost indistinguishable from that of the Bush
regime. The suspicious destabilization of Alvaro Colom's government in
Guatemala earlier this year was quickly succeeded by the&nbsp; Obama
government's cynical support-by-default for the military coup in
Honduras. Despite President Obama's anodyne drivel at the America's
Summit in Trinidad, diplomatic and media aggression against Venezuela
has barely paused for breath. The US State Department entrenched its
hallmark cynicism even more deeply with the&nbsp; cancellation of a
major aid programme to Nicaragua. <br>

      <br>

That accompanied outright refusal to make any significant change in the
US government's genocidal policy towards Cuba.&nbsp; All the elements
the United States government has always used&nbsp; against countries
whose resources or strategic position it covets, have been deployed to
destabilize regional&nbsp; targets of US government vindictiveness and
the multinational corporate sector's limitless greed. For example, the
innumerable articles alleging dictatorship in Nicaragua or Venezuela
are all part of the mendacious, sadistic Western Bloc governments'
global campaign to prevent the emancipation of nations and peoples they have
cheated, looted and murdered for centuries.<br>

      <br>

The case of Nicaragua<br>

      <br>

In Nicaragua, the country's Sandinista government headed by President
Daniel Ortega, despite enormous limitations and the global economic
crisis, has significantly improved many aspects of the country's
economy and society. But despite its impressive record in just under
three years of government in a viciously adverse international crisis,
rich country corporate and progressive media, especially since the
Sandinista landslide in the municipal elections of 2008,&nbsp; have
either excluded genuine news on Nicaragua or cynically recycled
opposition propaganda. <br>

      <br>

Now, as the Obama administration carefully manouevres into place all
the pieces and components it needs in order to provoke armed conflict
in Central America and the Andes, the propaganda leakage from the
corporate media into their neocolonial progressive counterparts and
their support networks looks ever more cynical and sinister. They hedge
their bets with vocal advocacy on human rights and environmental
issues, but&nbsp; tend to avoid categorical support for forces
resisting their government's policies of imperialist domination &#8211; for
example, Hizbollah, Hamas or the FARC. In the case of Nicaragua they
actively collaborate in promoting their governments' imperialist,
corporate-friendly destabilization agenda.<br>

      <br>

A typical article on Nicaragua in either the neocolonialist progressive
media or their mainstream corporate counterparts will almost always
consist of false allegations and downright lies like the following:<br>
      <ul>
<li>the FSLN government systematically violently persecutes political opponents</li><li>the 2008 local elections were rigged by the Sandinista controlled Electoral Council</li><li>no independent electoral observers monitored those 2008 local elections</li><li>Daniel Ortega repressively shut down two opposition political parties</li><li>the FSLN government has arbitrarily &#8220;cracked down&#8221; on non-profit organizations</li><li>Daniel Ortega personally, secretively and corruptly channels ALBA funds to his cronies</li><li>Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo are setting up a Somoza style dictatorship</li><li>Daniel Ortega violated the Constitution so as to allow his re-election</li><li>Nicaragua's Supreme Court is run by the Sandinistas to corrupt the rule of law </li>
      </ul>


Not one of these persistent claims, and many related allegations, are
even remotely true. But they are persistently recycled. Conversely, the
following facts are never reported:<br>

      <ul>
<li>Nicaragua's media are almost entirely controlled by companies and individuals aligned with the right wing Nicaraguan opposition;</li><li>the opposition persistently provoke confrontations so as to be
able to claim persecution, for example opposition supporters wantonly
attacked Sandinista supporters the day after the municipal elections and Sandinista journalists have frequently been attacked by
opposition supporters </li><li>the
2008 elections were ratified by independent international
observers. The opposition parties, despite alleging fraud, accepted the
results and took the relevant oaths of office. Eduardo Montealegre
refused to participate in a recount following the elections. The
oppostion have never presented the Supreme Electoral Council credible
evidence of the alleged fraud. The bogus "election monitoring" local
NGOs like Etica Y Transparencia are mostly funded by the US government and
brazenly participate in activities of political opposition<br>
 </li><li>it was the opposition PLC party that instigated the process to
shut down two rival opposition political parties prior to the municipal
elections, not the FSLN.</li><li>of
the 4800 or so non-profit organizations in Nicaragua just one
&#8211; CINCO belonging to right wing local media magnate, Carlos Fernando
Chamorro &#8211; has been subject to a formal legal accusation. That
accusation of money laundering was dismissed for lack of evidence.
The&nbsp; Public Prosecutor did find that Chamorro channelled CINCO's
non-profit income to his family via five private companies all owned by
him and his family. CINCO also channelled tens of thousands of dollars
of development aid to MAM, a political organization, member of the
opposition MRS alliance.</li><li>All
funding derived from ALBA is channelled through two legally
constituted entities subject to the relevant public accountability,
ALBANISA (a private joint-venture company with the Venezuelan State oil
company PDVSA as the majority owner) and ALBA-CARUNA a cooperative.
ALBANISA's
Nicaraguan counterpart, the State oil company Petronic, reports to the
National Assembly and to the IMF.</li><li>The FSLN used legitimate constitutional procedures to restore the
Nicaraguan people's right to elect freely their national and municipal
authorities &#8211; a basic constitutional provision stripped away by the
right wing opposition in the period of Violeta Chamorro's presidency. </li><li>The political opposition control the National Assembly. The
political opposition &#8211; in particular the Chamorro family media
dictatorship - overwhelmingly control Nicaragua's news media. The
political opposition shares equal quotas of representation in the
country's electoral and judicial authorities.</li><li>Censorship,
murders by the army and police, political prisoners, systematic torture by the security forces,
all characteristics of the US-supported fascist dictatorship in Honduras do
not exist in Nicaragua<br>
  </li>
      </ul>

The accusations of dictatorship against the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua are self-evidently absurd. They originate from a totally
discredited opposition with no viable political programme, already
heading for ignominious defeat in the 2011 presidential elections. The
latest opinion polls show the social democrat MRS political alliance &#8211;
the preferred information source for corporate and alternative foreign
news media alike &#8211; with just 2% popular support. &nbsp;<br>

      <br>

The sinister regional context<br>

      <br>

On a narrow local interpretation, the hysterical, counterfactual
denunciations of persecution can easily be dismissed. Inside
Nicaragua, the reality of the government's policies speaks very
positively. UN organizations like the FAO and UNESCO confirm the huge
effort the FSLN government has made to eliminate illiteracy and promote
food security. Exports in 2009 have already exceeded those for 2008,
itself a record year for Nicaraguan exports. Government credibility and
competence is reflected in polls showing&nbsp; a steady increase in
support for the FSLN, despite the economic crisis.<br>

      <br>

But a regional perspective renders the fake, ridiculous &#8220;Sandinista
dictatorship&#8221; propaganda extremely sinister indeed, because the US
government and its allies are trying to create an equivalence between
the illegitimate coup regime in Honduras and the successful
democratically elected government in Nicaragua. Last week near the
northern city of Matagalpa, Nicaraguan police and army intercepted an
arms shipment of dozens of automatic weapons, grenade launchers and
thousands of rounds of ammunition, apparently unrelated to the region's
narcotics cartels. <br>

      <br>

Local US allies like the leading businessman-cleric Bishop Abelardo
Matta, the media magnate Chamorro family and eternally-failed
US-embassy candidate Eduardo Montealegre, for years have actively
fomented an atmosphere of confrontation. US political allies regularly
make high profile interventionist&nbsp; statements criticising
President Daniel Ortega and his government. Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias, despite having&nbsp; used the courts in exactly the same way
himself, hypocritically criticised the Nicaraguan Supreme Court
decision to reassert Nicaraguans' right to elect their national
authorities freely without limits on an individual candidate's
re-election.<br>

      <br>

An even more flagrant intervention came from Holland's Johannes van
Baalen, president of the Liberal International &#8211; an umbrella group of
over 100 Liberal parties around the world. Van Baalen visited Nicaragua
and called for Daniel Ortega to resign. He met with the Nicaraguan army
high command, frankly admitting to Dutch radio that he did so to find
out if they would mount a coup against Daniel Ortega. Subsequently, van
Baalen, a former neo-nazi, visited Honduras. There, he named Honduran
coup regime dictator Roberto Micheletti as the Liberal International's
vice-president, describing the fascist pinochetti as the future of
democracy in the region. He may well be right - if the Obama
administration gets its way.<br>

      <br>

The growing hysteria from US local proxies inside Nicaragua, political
allies outside Nicaragua and corrosive propaganda drip-irrigation via
false, poisonous reporting in corporate and alternative news media has
a clear purpose. In the Andes, the similarly relentless campaign
against President Hugo Chávez is designed to set the scene for war with
Colombia, which will be directed from the new bases the United States
has just acquired there. In Central America, the campaign is designed
to create a perceived equivalence between looming inevitable violent
conflict in Honduras - as the majority Resistance opposed to the
illegitimate Honduran coup regime defends itself against
ever-increasing censorship, arbitrary detentions, torture and political
murders - and unprovoked armed violence planned by the discredited
minority opposition against the democratically elected government in
Nicaragua.<br>

      <br>

Time is running out for everyone. The Western Bloc countries know they
cannot readily restore their former imperial control in Latin America
via democratic elections. But they can sabotage the continent's
emancipation - lead by the ALBA countries, principally Bolivia, Cuba,
Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela - which may in the end amount to the
same thing. Brittle Latin American unity in opposition to the coup in
Honduras is unlikely to survive the approaching phase of US-provoked
violent regional conflict. The US government and its allies are
gambling that they will be able to divide and conquer as they have
always done in the past. Any reporting on the region needs to be read
with that very much in mind.<br>
