 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">COCHABAMBA,
BOLIVIA &#8211; OCTOBER 17th 2009</span><br>
      <br>
The Heads of State and of Government of the member countries of the
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America &#8211; Peoples' Trade
Treaty (ALBA-TCP), in the framework of its VIIth Summit in the city of
Cochabamba, in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, on October 17th
2009,&nbsp; and in recognition of the five years since its
foundation,&nbsp; underline its constitution as a social, economic and
political Alliance in defence of the sovereignty, self-determination
and&nbsp; identity of its peoples and as a reference point that &#8220;A
better world is possible&#8221;.<br>
      <br>
ALBA-TCP defends the principles of International Law, especially with
regard to sovereignty, the self-determination of peoples, the right to
development, territorial integrity and the promotion of social justice
and international peace and likewise the rejection of aggression, the
threat or use of force, foreign intervention and of unilateral coercive
measures against developing countries.<br>
      <br>
ALBA-TCP promotes the principles of solidarity, cooperation,
complementarity, mutual respect for the sovereignty of our countries,
justice, equity, respect for cultural diversity and harmony with
nature, and plays a fundamental role in revolutionary and progressive
processes at world level, thus becoming an alliance that promotes
solidarity between the countries of the South.<br>
      <br>
200 years after the first Cries of Liberty in America, the ALBA-TCP
Heads of State and of Government reaffirm their stalwart commitment to
continue advancing towards independence, liberty, self-determination
and union demanded by the peoples of Our America and of the Caribbean
and declare:<br>
      <br>
I<br>
      <br>
1. Of its essence, capitalism and its highest expression, imperialism,
are destroying humanity's very existence on Earth. The global economic
crisis, the climate change crisis, the food crisis and the energy
crisis are structural in character and are due, fundamentally to
unsustainable patterns of production, distribution and consumption and
to the concentration and accumulation of capital in very few hands, to
the endless, indiscriminate looting of natural resources, to the
commercialization of life and to speculation at every level for the
benefit of a few.<br>
      <br>
2. The worldwide economic crisis that began in the developed countries
and for which we are not responsible has greater impact on developing
countries via the increase in poverty and unemployment. Far from
registering a financing from the North of the South, one observes a
growing tendency towards net transfers of capital from the South to the
North. The purpose of dominant global economic policies is not to
promote the well-being of human beings but to save some banks and
companies.<br>
      <br>
3.&nbsp; The UN Conference at the Highest level on the Financial and
Economic Crisis and its impact on Development&#8221; in June this year,
despite its limitations, demonstrated the urgent need to advance
towards the building of a new, just and equitable international
economic order that will recognize and support the development
objectives of the countries of the South, like the creation of new
development mechanisms, the construction of a new international
financial architecture. The consolidation of an alternative
international currency and the development of just, solidarity-based,
complementary trade.<br>
      <br>
4. The financial crisis will not be solved in the framework of the G-8
or the G-20 or other exclusive groups. The only possible solution will
emanate from the G-192, represented by the General Assembly of the
United Nations, where all countries have a voice and a vote under equal
conditions. In this context it is necessary to give impetus to the
Special Working Group of the General Assembly, of open composition, so
as to maintain follow up to the crisis.<br>
      <br>
5. The global economic crisis cannot be solved only by financial,
regulatory, monetary or economic measures. A structural crisis requires
structural solutions. The support that developed countries are giving
to the big banks increases centralization of financial sector capital
in the hands of small groups, making more difficult the control and
regulation of that sector. Likewise, appropriate supervisory mechanisms
do not exist over the behaviour of large corporations and policies of
free competition. For that reason, a profound transformation is needed
of the real economy and not just the financial area.<br>
      <br>
6. To the global economic crisis one must add the climate change crisis
which is part of the wider ecological crisis affecting our Mother
Earth. Every year one third more than what the planet can regenerate is
consumed. At this rate of waste by the capitalist system, two planets
Earth will be necessary by 2030.<br>
      <br>
7. Human beings are part of an interdependent system&nbsp; of plants,
animals, mountains, forests, oceans and air with which they ought to
live in balance and harmony respecting the rights of all. To ensure
human rights one must recognize the rights of Mother Earth. To do so,
it is fundamental that the United Nations framework approves a
Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth. <br>
      <br>
8. Global warming and climate change are provoking the retreat and loss
of glaciers, impacting water resources so as to diminish sources of
drinking water, causing drought in different regions, greater frequency
of hurricanes and natural disasters, loss of biodiversity and of human
life.<br>
      <br>
9. Within the framework of a broader ecological debt, developed
countries owe a climate debt to developing countries thanks to their
historical responsibility for emissions and, as a result of the global
warming they have caused, for the adaptive measures we are forced to
carry out. This climate debt ought to be recognized and honoured via
the dispositions of the current climate change regime:<br>
      <br>
a) substantial reductions in the emission of domestic greenhouse-effect
gases to be determined on the basis of the proportion of global
emissions required by developing countries to meet their social and
economic development needs, to eradicate poverty and to achieve their
right to development;<br>
      <br>
b) compliance with commitments for effective technology transfer and<br>
      <br>
c) guarantees for the provision of the necessary additional financial
resources in an adequate, predictable and sustainable way, emphasizing
that the adaptive requirements of developing countries have increased,
as a consequence of the environmental crisis and highlighting that our
countries need this climate debt payment so as to make possible our own
mitigating actions.<br>
      <br>
10. In the UN Conference on Climate Change to be held in Copenhagen at
the end of the year, developed countries, within the framework of the
Kyoto protocols, should adopt significant commitments towards reducing
the emission of greenhouse effect gases and approve compensation
mechanisms for countries that preserve, protect and conserve their
forests.<br>
      <br>
11. The"Yasun&iacute; ITT" initiative carried out by Ecuador is an
effective voluntary measure to address the problem of climate change,
guaranteeing the conservation of one of the most bio-diverse places in
the world, an initiative for which Ecuador has given up exploiting 846
million barrels of oil that lie in the subsoils of the Yasuni National
Park, which will avoid the emission to the atmosphere of 407 million
tonnes of carbon which would otherwise be produced by the burning of
those fossil fuels. This initiative will contribute to respect for the
indigenous cultures of peoples in voluntary isolation who live in the
Yasuni Park and also to social development, nature conservation and the
promotion of the use of renewable energy sources.<br>
      <br>
12. The energy crisis is the product of irrational patterns of
consumption imposed by rich countries and of monopoly and financial
speculation to benefit large multinational companies.<br>
      <br>
13. To bring about a real change in energy access in the world ,
especially in developing countries carrying out efforts of cooperation,
complementation, and regional integration is fundamental to the
development of energy efficient models for generation, transmission and
consumption and to the development of renewable energies guaranteeing
access to services for the whole population.<br>
      <br>
14. Access to energy is a right peoples have that States should
guarantee via the strengthening of their public policies, of defence of
peoples' rights over their national natural resources and of the search
for sources of alternative energy, always bearing in mind conservation
and development in harmony with nature.<br>
      <br>
15. The negative impact&nbsp; of the food crisis on our peoples is one
of the most pressing problems of the 21st century which requires urgent
coordinated measures to ensure adequate, timely access to food and the
food sovereignty and security of developing countries. <br>
      <br>
16. The irrational use of foods to produce bio-fuels is a practice that
contributes to the food crisis, increases poverty, reduces forested
areas and the amount of land available to satisfy&nbsp; food needs,
makes these foods more expensive and increases the indiscriminate use
of water.<br>
      <br>
17. Migration is not a crime. Discrimination and criminalization of
migrants in all its forms should be abolished. Reform of the migratory
policies of the government of the United States is urgent as is the
revocation of the Return Directive of the European Union, with the aim
of stopping deportations and mass detentions, permitting the
reunification of families, eliminating the frontier wall of the United
States with Mexico, which both separates and divides our peoples rather
than uniting them. Discriminatory and selective laws and policies, that
cause loss of human life, should be abrogated, among them the so-called
&#8220;Cuban Adjustment Law&#8221; and the &#8220;dry feet &#8211; wet feet&#8221; policy applied by
the United States government to irregular immigrants from Cuba.<br>
      <br>
18. In opposition to migration policies based essentially on security,
imposed paradoxically in countries built on migrations, it is necessary
to deepen dialogue and actions between countries of origin, transit
countries and destination countries of migrants with the aim of dealing
with migration in an integral, comprehensive way with a focus centred
on the human being and respect for their rights.<br>
      <br>
19. Make clear their support for strengthening and creation of common
mechanisms that reinforce the progress of Latin American and Caribbean
countries on the interchange of experiences and best practices to
combat the trafficking of persons, illegal trafficking of migrants,
sexual and labour&nbsp; exploitation and other forms of exploitation.<br>
      <br>
20. Today South-South Cooperation has taken on great significance under
the impact of capitalism's global economic crisis on the peoples and
nations of the South. In this context, the Conference on South-South
Cooperation to be held in Kenya in December 2009 assumes great
importance.<br>
      <br>
21. Faced with the advance of progressive ideas and forces in Latin
America and the Caribbean which can be seen, among other ways, in the
strengthening of the ALBA-TCP, imperialism and right-wing forces have
reacted with the Coup d'Etat in Honduras and the installation of
military bases in Colombia.<br>
      <br>
22.&nbsp; The constitutional President of Honduras, compa&ntilde;ero
Jos&eacute; Manuel Zelaya Rosales, ought to be reinstated immediately
and unconditionally. No electoral process carried out under the coup
government, nor the authorities emerging from it, can be recognized by
the international community. The violation of human rights, the
detentions and deaths suffered today by the Honduran people are
aggravated by the failure of the delaying tactics of the dictatorship
and the proximity of the fraudulent elections called so as to try and
consolidate it. In this context it is fundamental to promote a
diplomatic offensive and definite actions to re-establish fully
Constitutional order.<br>
      <br>
23. The installation of US military bases in Latin America and the
Caribbean causes mistrust between peoples, endangers peace, threatens
democracy and facilitates hegemonic intervention in the continent.
Latin America and the Caribbean constitute a zone of peace that should
be free from the presence of military bases and foreign military forces
that threaten our peoples. The Colombian government should reconsider
the installation of those military bases. The territory illegally
occupied by the US Naval Base in Guantanamo should be returned
unconditionally to Cuba.<br>
      <br>
24. The economic, commercial and financial blockade of the United
States against the Republic of Cuba should end unconditionally,
unilaterally and immediately.<br>
      <br>
25. It is unacceptable that different governments damage international
norms by giving refuge and asylum to persons who do not qualify for
such status in accord with the applicable international instruments and
who are under process for crimes against humanity and terrorism, thus
obstructing the clarification of their debts to justice.<br>
      <br>
26. Defending cultural identity and diversity is basic to the struggle
against neo-colonialism. In that sense, it is important to move ahead
with the re-evaluation and decriminalization of chewing coca leaf, and
too to remove coca leaf from the List 1 of the 1961 Convention on
Stupefying Drugs.<br>
      <br>
27. The effective integral struggle against narco-trafficking should
take place with the strictest respect for sovereignty, non-intervention
in internal affairs, shared responsibility and respect for human rights
via regional and multilateral cooperative actions that expel forever
neo-colonial practices of certification and decertification in relation
to the issue and the withdrawal of trade concessions as applied by the
United States of America with hegemonic political aims.<br>
      <br>
28. Communications media must carry out their social activity
responsibly, ethically and as a public service for all citizens and not
be tools of some minority sectarian interests, nor be used as tools of
disinformation and political destabilization.<br>
      <br>
29. The process of building mutual trust between Bolivia and Chile so
as to resolve the historic Bolivian demand for a sovereign return to
the sea, in the framework of brotherhood, respect and trust between two
sister peoples is an effort that deserves the support of the whole
international community so as to arrive at tangible results.<br>
      <br>
30. The next general elections to be held on December 6th this year,
highlight anew the democratic convictions of the ALBA-TCP countries in
response to the coup-supportive attitudes and movements in Latin
America and the Caribbean.<br>
      <br>
II<br>
      <br>
The Heads of State and of Government of the member countries of the
&#8220;Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America &#8211; Peoples' Trade
Treaty&#8221; (ALBA-TCP) agree the following measures.<br>
      <br>
1. Approve the change in the name of the Single Regional Compensation
Payments (SUCRE) System to the Unitary Regional Compensation Payments
System (SUCRE), considering that the latter better expresses the sense

Compensation Payments System (SUCRE) as an instrument to reach monetary
and financial sovereignty, eliminate dependency on the US dollar in
regional trade, reduce asymmetries and consolidate progressively an
economic zone of shared development. They instruct the technical
Committees of the SUCRE to meet no later than the middle of November to
address the SUCRE Implantation Plan. (1)<br>
      <br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Note 1. The Commonwealth of
Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda and Saint

Bolivia.<br>
      <br>
13. Agree to prioritize and fund the Supranational ALBA-Education
Project that regards the educational system as a continuous and
integrated whole and contains lines of work in the areas of basic
education and university education.<br>
      <br>
14. Approve the creation of a Working Group in the framework of the
Council for Social Programmes to consider labour and social security
issues, including the ALBA-TCP's Labour Competence Certification with

ancestral&nbsp; know-how.<br>
      <br>
15. Urge the prompt establishment of a Ministerial Committee for Women
and Equal Opportunities so as to constitute a pro-active space making

30. Agree that the Political Council via a working group, should
present a proposal for the analysis and development of the ALBA-TCP
Radio South project, the creation of an ALBA-TCP news agency and the
setting up of issue-based channels with co-production shared between
the ALBA-TCP countries so as to give impetus to a communications model
that allows a real meeting of our peoples, strengthens democratic
processes in the region and breaks the communications barriers imposed
by the large multinational media powers.<br>
      <br>
31. Instruct the Political Council to present a proposal to create an
ALBA Film and Television School&nbsp; gathering together the experience

and its relation to poverty and social exclusion. The ultimate
objective of this programme is to promote the efficient integration of
people with disability, without discrimination, into all areas,
