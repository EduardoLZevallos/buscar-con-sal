      <br>

McClatchy News has again convincingly demonstrated the complicity of
mainstream corporate news media as the pliant propaganda arm of the US
State Department. McClatchy reporter Tim Johnson wrote a brace of
articles (1) based on what was clearly a brief visit to Managua,
Nicaragua's capital. His articles add up to a superficial smear job
against Nicaragua's Sandinista government and its leader Daniel Ortega.
      <br>

      <br>

These reports from McClatchy News are a kind of ersatz anti-news. They
have the same relation to good, factual information as fast junk-food
does to a healthy balanced diet. For&nbsp; McNews, as for its corporate
competitors, satisfying investors, defending market share, keeping
advertisers happy, stringing along with official government comment all
seem to take priority over giving a true and fair view of events.<br>

      <br>

By now, the corporate anti-Sandinista litany on Nicaragua is quite
familiar. Most McNews-style reports always have a giveaway to alert
readers they are ingesting dense psy-warfare depleted-plutocracy junk.
Tim Johnson's reports are no exceptions. Half way through the August
5th article&nbsp; entitled, &#8220;Despite constitution, Nicaragua's Ortega
plans to stay in power&#8221;, Johnson reports &#8220;A slight paunch, a receding
hairline and a bigger bank account distinguish Ortega from his days as
a leader of the Sandinista front, which battled the U.S.-backed Contras
and ruled from 1979 to 1990.&#8221; <br>

      <br>

The factual sum total of that sentence is that Daniel Ortega is over
thirty years older than he was in 1979 - hardly a scoop. Johnson laces
the completely trivial factual content of the sentence with sly
innuendo. After all, the only reason to mention that Daniel Ortega has
&#8220;a bigger bank account&#8221; - as most people would do over their lifetime &#8211;
is to imply that Ortega in some way illicitly enriched himself over the
years. <br>

      <br>

This anti-reporting McNews pap bulks up the article's false argument
that Daniel Ortega is violating the country's constitution by intending
to run as a candidate for the presidential elections due in 2011. A few
months ago, Nicaragua's Supreme Court ruled on a legal challenge to a
1990s legislative constitutional reform that changed the rules on
eligibility for municipal and presidential elections. Nicaragua's 1987
constitution has been changed at various times over the last twenty
years. Just as, in the US, the Supreme Court rules on disputes over
what is or is not constitutional, that same role is performed by
Nicaragua's Supreme Court. <br>

      <br>

So it is completely false of Johnson and his McNews editors to use the
headline &#8220;Despite constitution, Nicaragua's Ortega plans to stay in
power&#8221;. In Nicaragua, the country's Supreme Court decides what is
constitutional, not some neocolonial corporate US McNews outfit.
Bloated with that kind of self-important neocolonial cant, the article
is virtually fact free once you start poking at it. Johnson's abuse of
the facts and his penchant for vital omissions is as egregious as the
way he packs his articles with multiple quotes from the opposition,
while cherry-picking isolated quotes taken out of context from a single
conversation with a government economic adviser.<br>

      <br>

Johnson writes &#8220;Ortega also has made it clear that he's willing to shut
down the National Assembly if it doesn't comply with his wishes.&#8221; That
disinformation is based on banter between President Ortega and a high
level group of business representatives at a meeting between
Nicaragua's business community and the government. Johnson makes it
sound as though Ortega expressed some kind of clear intention to try
and intimidate the National Assembly.<br>

      <br>

Later in the article, Johnson attempts to give more context to that
false allegation. But the fact that he and his McNews editors placed
such a flagrant falsehood early in the article betrays their bad faith.
Most readers of any given article only read the first few paragraphs.
It is common corporate media McNews practice to pack disinformation
into the first few paragraphs so as to get the propaganda message
across. Subsequently, in the rest of the article, they can elaborate at
greater length, giving themselves something approaching an alibi for
the toxic disinformation junk they passed off to begin with.<br>

      <br>

In fact, in this case, Ortega put it to the assembled business leaders
that, if Nicaraguan society in general, including them, authorized him
to, then he would be prepared to act in the event of a critical
breakdown in the legislature. Johnson does not know that because he
never saw the exchange. As becomes clear later in his article, much of
his journalism is partially-sourced junk puff-toad hearsay.<br>

      <br>

Similarly, Johnson writes, Daniel Ortega &#8220;showed little inclination to
ensure that next year's elections are free and fair. A key aide
rejected letting international election observers monitor the vote.&#8221;
Here, Johnson stuffs an isolated off-the-cuff quote from a government
economic adviser into the McNews information mangle in order to wring
out a non-existent official presidential position on international
election monitors. As in the previous false allegation, he elaborates
somewhat later in the article.<br>

      <br>

The facts are that every single election in Nicaragua in recent years,
even the regional and municipal elections, let alone the presidential
and national legislative elections, have all been monitored by foreign
election monitors. That was true in the 2008 municipal elections too,
despite mainstream corporate McNews-style media falsely reporting the
opposite. In Nicaragua, the Supreme Electoral Council - a separate
power of State from the Executive - defines the norms as regards
election monitoring. <br>

      <br>

Government routinely facilitates the conditions necessary for election
monitoring to take place in accordance with those Supreme Electoral
Council norms. Tim Johnson could easily have verified that reality by
talking to Roberto Rivas, the President of the Consejo Supremo
Electoral. Rivas is generally very accessible to the media. But the
people Johnson decided to use as information sources were the same old
nationally discredited toadies-to-the-oligarchy who are always trotted
out to satisfy the corporate news and State Department propaganda line.<br>

      <br>

They all appear in Johnson's article &#8211; Eduardo Montealegre, a banker
indicted for multi-million dollar fraud; Carlos Fernando Chamorro
unscrupulous scion of Nicaragua's Chamorro monopolistic news media
family; Vilma Nuñez de Escorcia, disingenuous ex-Sandinista human
rights bureaucrat who has repeatedly and absurdly described Nicaragua
as a dictatorship. Ex-mayor of Managua, Moises Hassan, also makes an
appearance. <br>

      <br>

Sergio Ramirez, the novelist, gets a McNews outing as does Dora Maria
Tellez, former Sandinista health minister. They all represent a tiny
prosperous clique apparently eaten away with resentment and venomous
hatred for their former FSLN colleagues. They and their incompetent
political buddies &#8211; supported by their patrons among the United States
and European Union&nbsp; governments - have been completely
out-manoeuvred by the Sandinista FSLN led by Daniel Ortega.<br>

      <br>

When McNews can't source a fact, no worries &#8211;&nbsp; journalists like
Tim Johnson readily invent them. Try this, &#8220;Venezuela sells Nicaragua
crude oil at half price, which Ortega can resell, using the profit for
whatever he wants. The deal began when Ortega was elected in 2006 after
defeats in 1996 and 2001.&#8221;<br>

      <br>

The facts are, Venezuela's State oil company PDVSA sells oil and oil
derivatives to ALBANISA a mixed capital company owned by PDVSA and the
Nicaraguan State oil company PETRONIC. ALBANISA pays half the price
within 30 days and the balance is repayable at very low interest over
20 years. Pending repayment, the balance is paid half into a fund
ultimately under the auspices of the ALBA trading framework's Social
Fund and half into a fund managed by CARUNA, a national cooperative
savings institution which manages large sums of money for numerous
foreign institutions promoting economic development in Nicaragua. <br>

      <br>

The entities concerned, the private company ALBANISA, the State company
PETRONIC and&nbsp; ALBA-CARUNA are all subject to the relevant audit
and tax reporting standards. They are&nbsp; overseen by bodies like the
National Assembly's Economic Commission, the country's national
taxation authority, the national body responsible for supervising banks
and other financial entities and the national Customs authority. The
State company PETRONIC is subject to audit by the national audit body
known as the Controller General's Office. <br>

      <br>

An audit of PETRONIC was completed recently by the Controller General's
Office which made only trivial technical recommendations to improve the
State body's financial controls and reporting.&nbsp; Hardly McNews fit
to print, hence its absence from Johnson's extensive anti-Ortega
farrago.&nbsp; The ALBA companies state that the contractual terms of
their transactions require all funds to be used for purposes related to
social and economic development. So McNews and Tim Johnson's article
simply invented a falsehood and printed it as fake-fact, a kind of
news-botulism to poison their readers' minds against Daniel Ortega.<br>

      <br>

To continue the news-botulism salad, Johnson gratuitously adds ,
&#8220;Ortega wheels around Managua in a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle,
and his offspring are known to enjoy luxury cars. 'His sons have
already savored the money. Many of them drive Range Rovers, Mercedes
and BMWs in Costa Rica. They like what the oligarchs have. Ortega is
starting to enjoy it, too,' said Eduardo Montealegre.&#8221; <br>

      <br>

Even if Montealegre's glib remark were true, why should Ortega's family
not enjoy what other well-off middle class young adults do? The remarks
are a non sequitur coming from California Dreamin' Tim Johnson. Coming
from an oligarch banker indicted for fraud like Eduardo Montealegre,
they are downright hypocrisy, his trademark.<br>

      <br>

Well into this McNews article Tim Johnson does actually get one fact
right. &#8220;Most of the nine "comandantes" who formed the party's national
directorate left it years ago.&#8221; That is true. It is also the case that
they claim to be morally superior to their former colleagues in the
FSLN whose leadership they accuse of being amoral opportunists. Well,
that all depends from what perspective you look at things.<br>

      <br>

Of the nine comandantes, four - Jaime Wheelock, Victor Tirado Lopez,
Humberto Ortega and Luis Carrion - have all become prosperous
businessmen. Plenty of people in Nicaragua across the political
spectrum regard them as&nbsp; amoral opportunists. Important, highly
relevant facts like that contradict the poisonous McNews message. The
political nitty-gritty now is that the party of ex-Sandinistas like
Victor Tirado, Luis Carrion, Dora Maria Tellez and Sergio Ramirez
enjoys less than 2% support in Nicaragua. Even the right wing opinion
polls give the FSLN led by Daniel Ortega around 40% support with the
opposition parties totaling under 30% and the rest don't-knows.<br>

      <br>

To try and reinforce the false image of the FSLN government he and his
McNews editors are trying to create, Johnson writes,&nbsp; &#8220;Members of
the Ortega Cabinet rarely speak in public.&#8221; This ridiculous untruth is
completely absurd. Ministers like Agriculture Minister Ariel Bucardo or
Samuel Santos the Foreign Minister, or Sonia Castro the Health Minister
or officials like the President of the Central Bank Antenor Rosales and
their colleagues frequently talk to the news media, appearing regularly
on TV and radio. Only a know-nothing foreigner in town for a day or two
could possibly believe such nonsensical claims coming from heavily
truth-challenged individuals like Sergio Ramirez and his sidekicks.<br>

      <br>

Johnson seems miffed that Rosario Murillo, Daniel Ortega's wife and a
key architect of FSLN strategy, &#8220;didn't respond to an e-mail sent to
her personal account.&#8221; How sensible of her given that what she says
would very definitely have been cherry-picked and distorted in the same
the way as Johnson's conversation with President Ortega's economic
strategist Bayardo Arce. At this point Johnson wheels out as exhibit A,
Nicaragua's renowned centre-right I'm-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here
stage-prop, Sergio Ramirez. Ramirez is a leading architect of his
Sandinista Renewal Movement's stunning plunge into political oblivion.
In Nicaragua, only fiction loving foreign journalists like Tim Johnson
pay any attention to him.<br>

      <br>

Johnson goes on to tag Daniel Ortega as a hypocrite, writing , &#8220;he's
cooperated with Washington on anti-narcotics and immigration matters,
lashing out at U.S. imperialism only to rally domestic support.&#8221;
Johnson's intellectual dishonesty is matched only by his laziness. In
every international forum at which he speaks, whether it's the Rio
Group, the OAS, UNASUR, or the Ibero-American Summits, Daniel Ortega
consistently criticizes US government cynicism and double standards.
Johnson's pathetic slur is easily refuted by a quick search on the web.
      <br>

      <br>

Johnson's failure to recognize an outstanding statesman when he sees
one, comes as no surprise, since, in the US, they don't exist.
Politically and diplomatically, Daniel Ortega and colleagues like
former UN General Secretary Miguel D'Escoto have proved&nbsp; more than
a match for their US counterparts.&nbsp; With its economic system in
massive housing-and-unemployment seizure, the US government has had to
resort to brute militarization and support for military coups in order
to roll back by intimidation the successful regional diplomacy
Nicaragua had pushed dramatically forward together with ALBA&nbsp;
allies like Venezuela and Cuba up until the US-government supported
2009 military coup in Honduras.<br>

      <br>

To try and make his forlorn case stick, Johnson persistently resorts to
blatant omission. Another example, &#8220;In early January, Ortega made
another move that critics decried, decreeing that 25 government
officials, including two allies on the Supreme Court, could keep their
jobs even though their constitutional terms had expired.&#8221; Here, Johnson
blithely omits the constitutional crisis caused by the opposition in
the National Assembly unconstitutionally sabotaging the election of new
officials to important posts including magistrates on the Supreme Court
and the Supreme Electoral Council as well as the Controller General's
Office, among others. <br>

      <br>

Critics of the opposition's treacherous sabotage get airbrushed out by
Johnson, only Ortega's critics get a hearing. In fact, Ortega's decree
expressly stipulates that the various officials, among whom figure a
good number of individuals allied with Nicaragua's political
opposition, should remain in their posts until such time as the
National Assembly votes for their replacements. Clearly, Johnson leaves
that bit out because it makes the Nicaraguan opposition, whom he and
his McNews editors blatantly favour, look bad.<br>

      <br>

That self-evident bias is clear in Johnson's citation of only
opposition-friendly opinion polls. McNews states, &#8220;Opinion polls gauge
Ortega's public support at 35 to 38 percent, which would seem slim
except that the political opposition is deeply divided.&#8221; Tim Johnson
only had to check out polls regularly published this year by Consulta
Siglo Nuevo, a company sympathetic to the FSLN government, to get poll
results that look very different. <br>

      <br>

The Consulta Siglo Nuevo poll in May this year found that 52% of people
think President Ortega is doing a good job. 44.9% of those polled said
they would definitely vote for Daniel Ortega to continue in government.
Over 20% said they might do so. In July, a Consulta Siglo Nuevo poll in
Nicaragua's capital Managua found that over 47% of people polled would
definitely vote for Daniel Ortega to continue in government with over
14% saying that they might do so. Those figures put a completely
different light on the figures quoted by McNews.<br>

      <br>

Tim Johnson continues his McNews mixture of invention, falsehood,
omission and shreds of truth in another article where he elaborates
and, in part, makes amends for his failure to report accurately the
reality of Venezuela's development cooperation with Nicaragua. This
article&nbsp; - &#8220;Nicaragua finds huge patron in Venezuela's Chavez&#8221; -
acknowledges that Venezuela's development cooperation has, among other
important achievements, helped transform Nicaragua's domestic
agricultural economy.<br>

      <br>

But Venezuela's economic support has been so successful mainly because
Daniel Ortega's government has worked hard to diversify Nicaragua's
trade and development cooperation relationships. Cooperation from
traditional aid partners like the US, Canada and the European Union
countries has been supplemented not just with development support from
Venezuela but also from Russia, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Iran,
Brazil and Mexico. Record foreign investment has helped Nicaragua
generate record exports based mainly on record domestic agricultural
production. All this completely gives the lie to claims that Nicaragua
is hopelessly dependent on Venezuelan funding &#8211; which is the main
argument made here by McNews. <br>

      <br>

In any case, Tim Johnson hardly deserves credit for acknowledging major
advances in Nicaragua's economic and social indicators. These have been
confirmed by the World Bank, the IMF, the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, UNESCO and the Pan-American Health Organization as well
as other regional multilateral institutions like the Inter-American
Development Bank and the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration. While admitting, as it were through gritted teeth, the
transformation of Nicaragua's agriculture and infrastructure, Johnson
stays on the US State Department message, alleging that Venezuelan
funding &#8220;created a web of Ortega-controlled companies with no public
oversight, making the president a force in Nicaragua's economy and
blurring the lines between what belongs to him, to his party and to the
citizenry.&#8221;<br>

      <br>

But ALBA-CARUNA and ALBANISA&nbsp; as well as other ALBA companies like
the food enterprise ALBALINISA are all subject to the same controls as
other private sector businesses and financial institutions and,
ultimately to majority shareholder PDVSA and that company's oversight
bodies. A correct translation of this McNews item might well be, &#8220;the
FSLN have freed up resources to benefit people in Nicaragua that would
otherwise have been hijacked by a corrupt ruling class used to having
things all their own way.....&#8221;<br>

      <br>

Johnson cites more or less neutral analysts like Alejandro Martinez
Cuenca who confirm dramatic drops in rural and urban poverty over the
last five years &#8211; 15% in overall poverty and 8% in extreme poverty - as
a result of policies implemented by Nicaragua's Sandinista government
under Daniel Ortega, funded largely, but not solely, with Venezuelan
assistance. But Johnson and his McNews editors still feel bound to
quote the disingenuous claim by ex-Sandinista Vilma Nuñez de Escorcia
that poverty is as bad as it ever was. Johnson failed to point out that
Martinez Cuenca's study was funded by European development agencies &#8211;
no friends of the FSLN &#8211; with technical assistance from the World Bank.<br>

      <br>

Johnson notes, &#8220;Critics of the Venezuelan aid deny that it's reduced
rural poverty, alleging that Ortega has siphoned off the money to
strengthen his party and himself.&#8221; In fact, the Nicaraguan government
can point to independent surveys which confirm data on poverty
reduction. By contrast, Johnson and the people he very clearly
sympathizes with who oppose the FSLN government are unable to back up
their accusations that Venezuelan aid has been corruptly diverted for
squalid personal aggrandizement, whereas the hugely positive practical
results of all that investment are there for all to see. It would be
surprising if an ALBA-related financial corruption scandal did not
happen some time because that is in the nature of organizations
anywhere managing large sums of money and wielding great power. But
there seem to be no signs of such a scandal now and Tim Johnson reports
nothing to indicate that such a scandal might be imminent.<br>

      <br>

As part of the deceitful US State Department McNews propaganda line,
Johnson alleges that&nbsp; the&nbsp; purchase linked to ALBANISA of
local TV Channel 8 meant &#8220;temporarily forcing off the air the debate
program of one of Ortega's fiercest critics, Carlos Fernando Chamorro,
who spent months finding another private channel that was willing to
risk the government's wrath to host his show.&#8221; <br>

      <br>

In fact, Chamorro's program was not &#8220;forced off the air&#8221;. Chamorro
himself chose to leave the station. Tim Johnson could readily have
sourced a piece by Agence France-Presse on January 25th this year,
&#8220;Opposition journalist Chamorro closes two opinion programs in
Nicaragua&#8221; quotes Chamorro as justifying his decision &#8211; no one else's -
to shut his two programs on Channel 8. AFP&nbsp; reports &#8220;Chamorro
said, 'This is a matter of principle', asserting that the channel 'is
now associated with party political and government interests.' &#8221; If
Chamorro had difficulty getting back on the air, the most likely reason
will have been that hardly anyone was willing to put up with his
insufferable vanity.<br>

      <br>

Johnson's account is clearly derived from sources close to Chamorro, if
not from Chamorro himself, who regularly dramatizes himself as the
brave victim of political persecution. The record demonstrates that
Carlos Fernando Chamorro is himself a cynical political operator. He
and his family ruthlessly exploit the media power of their virtual
Press monopoly in Nicaragua to destroy their political enemies and to
project and promote their own political cronies, like Chamorro's
brother-in-law, electorally-nowhere Edmundo Jarquin of the Sandinista
Renewal Movement.<br>

      <br>

Johnson's dismal journalism is all of a piece with the practice of
European colleagues like Rory Carroll of the Guardian or John Carlin
who writes often for Spain's El País or the British Independent. The
reporting by these individuals is often so poor that if they worked for
any kind of business&nbsp; where falsehoods and incompetence would cost
their company money they'd most likely get their dismissal notice
straight away. But they benefit from the nefarious amoral osmosis
between corporate mass media, global high finance and government. <br>

      <br>

The irony of reports accusing the Sandinista government in Nicaragua of
corruption, or of covering up the facts is that the writers themselves
are key actors in exactly the kind of corrupt, mendacious culture they
try to pin on their targets. Double-dealing and fakery are now
prerequisites for promotion and enrichment in the media-high
finance-governmental networks of consumer capitalist countries in North
America and Europe. A direct link exists between the debauchment and
fixing of those countries economic policies and the debasement of their
news media. The pernicious effects on corporate news reporting are
clear from Tim Johnson's McNews articles on Nicaragua.<br>
