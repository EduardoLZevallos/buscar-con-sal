progress made by the FSLN government in terms of infrastructure is
transforming the country <br>
      </big><br>
      </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">B</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">y Karla Jacobs<br>
23rd June 2010</span></span><br>
      <br>
When the FSLN government came to power in January 2007, it inherited a
country whose infrastructure was on its knees. With few exceptions
transport services had been neglected with roads, bridges, ports
throughout the country left, literally, to rot, during the three
previous neoliberal governments. <br>
      <br>
The lack of appropriate knowledge and skill of the former government
officials responsible for these areas, combined with unrestrained
corruption had created a situation whereby economic activity at a
grass roots level had stagnated and access to basic goods and services
was drastically compromised for people in most places in Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
As current Infrastructure and Transport Minister Pablo Martínez
explained to Tortilla con Sal during an interview on June 18th, towards
the end of former president Enrique Bolaños' administration
(2001 - 2006) the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
(which together finance the majority of infrastructure projects in
Nicaragua) "had practically blocked disbursements [for infrastructure
projects] ... in response to the findings of corrupt management of
funds."<br>
      <br>
But not only did the former administration involve itself in the theft
of public funds destined for infrastructure projects, it actually
failed to use a significant proportion of the institution's assigned
budget at all.
In 2006, for example, as a result of inefficiency in project
formulation and implementation 37% of the MTI's capital investment
budget was simply never spent. Minister Martínez believes this
is an indicator of the lack of interest shown by former MTI officials
in fulfilling their responsibilities. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Since 2007 the new MTI authorities led by Minister Martínez have
been able to win back the trust of the World Bank, the Interamerican
Development Bank and others by reducing to less than 2% the percentage
of investment capital left unspent each year and by providing solid
evidence that the money destined to infrastructure projects is used
appropriately. Since 2007 the Comptroller General Office has not found
any cases of badly managed funds within the MTI. <br>
      <br>
As a result both of the renewed trust of international financial
institutions and new sources of funding, mainly from ALBA (the
Bolivarian
Alliance for the Americas), the MTI's investment budget has
increased by nearly 10% (from US$96,305,017 in 2006 to US$104,924,517
in 2010). The effective increase in terms of the
amount invested is much greater, though, given that over a third of
2006 investment budget was not used.<br>
      <br>
One classic example demonstrating the difference between the former and
the current MTI authorities' approach to spending is the bidding
process for a major road construction project. referred to as "Los
Caminos de Grava - Jinotega" (gravel roads - Jinotega). The original
bidding process took place in 2006 and was
overseen by the former administration although the construction
project, which was financed by the Interamerican Development Bank, was
not to be carried out until 2007.<br>
      <br>
After the FSLN came to power, however, the new MTI officials found
reason
to believe the three companies that had put forward offers had fixed
the price of their offers unrealistically high and were able to
persuade the
Interamerican Development Bank to nullify the original bidding
process. <br>
      <br>
MTI began a new&nbsp; process in early 2007 altering the
requirements slightly in order
to allow the participation of a greater number of companies. From the
quotes offered during this second bidding process, it was
clear that the MTI had been right in suspecting price fixing. <br>
      <br>
As a
result of the MTI's insistence on nullifying the first bidding, the
institution was able to save US$5 million on the construction of the
road in question. According to Martínez, US$5 million is enough
to build 20 kilometres of newly paved road. It is "enough to change the
life of an entire town." <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Neoliberal governments focused
spending on international highways <br>
      <br>
      </span>As well as a radically different
approach to
money, the new MTI authorities have also developed a strategic plan
which could be considered diametrically opposed to that of the
previous governments which focused almost exclusively on the
construction and maintenance of the Panamerican Highway and other
international routes while roads crucial for regional production fell
into total
disrepair and a large proportion of the population found travel
increasingly difficult. <br>
      <br>
Minister Martínez explains the unjust nature of the arrangement
concerning the international highways implemented by previous
administrations: <br>
      <br>
      <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">During the 17 years
[of
neo liberal governments] priority was given to the international
highways - the road from Peñas Blancas [on the border with Costa
Rica] to El Guasaule, Las Manos and El Espino [on the border with
Honduras]. The construction of these highways cost Nicaragua US$800
million which was financed by international banks. But what is the
effect of this? </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
        <br style="font-style: italic;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Guatemala has the greatest
GDP in Central America, and Guatemala
exports a lot to Costa Rica. And in order for Guatemala's products to
reach
Costa Rica they go along the 600 km of Nicaragua's international
highways. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
        <br style="font-style: italic;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Costa Rica has the second
greatest GDP in the region and Costa Rica
exports to the north - to Honduras, to El Salvador, to Guatemala - and
all that produce goes along Nicaragua's highways. Panama also exports
to the north crossing Nicaragua's highways. El Salvador exports a
lot to Costa Rica and those products cross Nicaragua. Honduras trades
with Costa Rica and those products cross Nicaragua. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
        <br style="font-style: italic;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Nicaragua has the smallest
GDP in Central America which means that it
is
the country that produces least and exports least. However, it is a
country that almost all international traffic passes through.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
        <br style="font-style: italic;">
        <small><big style="font-style: italic;">So who pays for this
highway to be maintained?
There is a tax on fuel in Nicaragua which is used to pay for the
maintenance of these highways. For a number of reasons, however, fuel
is more
expensive in Nicaragua than it is in Costa Rica and Honduras. So the
international traffic fills up before entering the country and doesn't
buy a drop of fuel within Nicaragua. They don't pay the tax to maintain
the 600 kilometres of highway.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
So the ones who pay for this highway are the poor citizens of Bilwi, of
Las Minas, of Pantasma, who might have never even travelled along the
route. Or maybe a family member of theirs travelled half the route
when they were migrating to another country to look for work</big>
.&nbsp; <br>
        </small><small><br>
        </small></blockquote>
So while the international routes were maintained in top condition
facilitating other countries' trade, roads in the rest of the country -
the vast majority of which are not paved - deteriorated rapidly with
each rainy season that passed. Indeed, according to recent MTI
statistics, only 14.94% of Nicaraguan roads are
in good condition (which means that they are guaranteed to be
transitable at all times of
year). Even routes to many important cities were vulnerable
to collapse during heavy rains during previous governments.<br>
      <br>
The roads
to the main coffee producing
towns,
Matagalpa and Jinotega, for example, were in a state of disrepair when
the FSLN assumed power three and a half years ago. At that stage it
could take up to three hours to travel the 35 kilometres from Jinotega,
through Matagalpa, and on to Sébaco (where the road meets with
the Pan American highway). Today, with newly paved roads, the same
journey takes just 40 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MTI introduces a new strategic
policy based on people and production</span><br>
      <br>
The road to Jinotega and Matagalpa is one of dozens of newly paved
roads the government has invested in since 2007 as part of the MTI's
new strategy focussing on people and production.<br>
      <br>
It is clear from government representative's words and actions that the
current infrastructure policy has been designed taking into account the
devastating human and economic costs of the lack of investment in roads
prior to 2007. <br>
      <br>
One woman
commented to Minister Martínez
during
the event marking the beginning of construction work on the road to
Huehuete (Carazo) that "these puddles are not full of rain water but of
our tears:" <br>
      <br>
      <blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">When we have to
tramp
through the mud carrying our
children and what little produce we have, or when we have to carry a
sick person to the hospital and he dies on the way because no vehicle
could come to get him, ... then we cry and cry. These puddles are full
of our tears.</span><br>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
In economic terms Nicaragua suffers unquantifiable losses as a result
of its inadequate infrastructure. In macro economic terms this is
reflected in the fact that up to 20% of beef (one of the country's main
export products) extracted from areas where there is no proper road is
lost as a result of the bruising suffered by cattle in trucks en route
to the slaughterhouse. In microeconomic terms it is reflected in the
extent by which the price of basic products increases the further away
you get from a paved road.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The red and green lines on the map below mark the completed road
construction and repair projects carried out by MTI between 2007 and
2009:<br>

<br>
      </div>

      
      </div><br>
As a result of these projects, agricultural
producers from towns and communities in departments across Nicaragua
are able to depend on affordable and reliable access to market for
their products while the general population in these same areas has
greater and more affordable access to basic goods and services.<br>
      <br>
Among the dozens of towns and cities which have benefited from
newly paved roads since 2007 are San Juan del Río Coco and
Telpaneca in the department of Madriz,
Matagalpa and San Isidro in the department of Matagalpa,
Jinotega, Guayacán, San Rafael del Norte, La Concordia and
Llanos de Colón in the department of Jinotega,&nbsp; Aposentillo
in the department of Chinandega, Malpaisillo,
Poneloya and Las Peñitas in the department of León, San
Francisco Libre, Quebrada Honda and Los Zarzales in the department of
Managua, Casares, Huehuete, La Boquita, San Antonio and San Gregorio in
the department of Carazo,&nbsp; La Virgen, Buenos Aires, Popoyuapa,
Tola and Nancimí in the department of Rivas, Juigalpa, Cuapa, La
Libertad, Santo Domingo, San Pedro
de Lóvago and Santo Tomás in the department of Chontales,
El Ayote in the RAAS, and San Miguelito and San Carlos in the
department of Río San Juán. <br>
      <br>
Indeed the government's road
construction plan has been so ambitious that at several points over the
last three years the Nicaraguan paving
block companies' production has been overwhelmed. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Road to Bilwi: a major
engineering undertaking</span><br>
      <br>
The most ambitious road construction project undertaken by this
government is the road to Bilwi. Three years ago it could take more
than a week to drive the 450
kilometres to
Managua from Bilwi (the only major town in the entire expanse of
Nicaragua's north eastern region and a major seafood producer). <br>
      <br>
This route was infamous for being one of the worst in Nicaragua. Even
heavy duty four wheel drive trucks would get stuck in the abundant
"pegaderos" or swamps for hours or even days provoking costly repairs
for their owners. The immense difficulty involved in getting to Bilwi
by road also meant the price paid by the local population for all goods
imported from the Pacific
coast was often double or triple that paid by consumers on the Pacific
side of the country.<br>
      <br>

      <div style="text-align: right;"><small style="font-style: italic;">photo:&nbsp; MTI</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
      </div>
      <br>
Today, after the MTI has dedicated extensive funds and
expertise on improving the road, the same journey takes around 24
hours. <br>
      <br>
The ongoing project to radically improve the road to Bilwi is a major
engineering
project given the marshland
quality of the terrain. The Venezuelan Army Corp of Engineers has
been involved in assessing the viability of the project. <br>
      <br>
So far 40 bridges
have been built or repaired with funds donated by the Danish government
and work on the worst
part of the route located near the town of Siuna has been completed.
This part of the road
is made up of various stretches of "pegaderos" totalling over 16km,
which were once impassable even by the
sturdiest vehicle during the heaviest rains. <br>
      <br>
When asked about this project, Minister Martínez had this to say:<br>
      <blockquote><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">With the road to Bilwi we
have committed to guaranteeing
transitability, to getting rid of the swamps. ... The road to Bilwi is
one of the priorities [of this government]. We aren't going to
finish&nbsp;
the project [during this administration]. We are talking about 300
kilometres of
road [from Río Blanco to Bilwi]. It is a huge investment. And no
bank is willing to finance it because they say we won't get back what
we invest. </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
        <br style="font-style: italic;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">But [this government]
believes we can continue gradually improving the
road and that within 15 years we will have a good quality highway which
will last a long time.</span> <br>
      </blockquote>
      <small>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </small> <span style="font-weight: bold;">MTI's long-term
strategic plan</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
Towards the end of 2009 the MTI presented its long term road
construction strategy to the World Bank and other international
financial institutions which proposes the construction of 1,800
kilometres of roads between 2011 and 2020 (200 kilometres a year for
each of the nine years). In 2009 the MTI built 150 kilometres with
World Bank funds. So far this year the MTI is on track to build 200
kilometres.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Given the excellent relations the MTI currently enjoys with the
institutions and governments that finance infrastructure projects in
Nicaragua, it is not by any means implausible that the government will
be able to secure the funding it needs to carry out the above mentioned
nine year plan which would equip Nicaragua with the roads it needs to
drastically improve social well-being and reactivate economic activity
in even the
most remote communities across the nation. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The FSLN government has invested
impressive amounts in ports and airports&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
The FSLN government's infrastructure policy is not only based on road
building, however. Impressive infrastructural improvements in terms of
ports and airports have also been achieved over the last three years.<br>
      <br>
CISCONCO-WILBUR SMITH ASSOCIATES, the US transnational consultant
company commissioned to write a National Transport Plan for Nicaragua
by Arnoldo Aleman's administration in 1999, described the national port
and waterways infrastructure as "obsolete." This report recommended the
redefinition of the National Ports Company (EPN) something that did not
come into effect in practice until the FSLN came to power in 2007.<br>
      <br>
Indeed the EPN was pretty much invisible during the previous neoliberal
governments: apart from commenting on the latest calamity due to lack
of investment in existing ports, the EPN kept a very low profile. Since
2007, however, the EPN has overseen major investments both in the
improvement and maintenance of existing ports and the construction of
new piers and ports. The total amount of money invested in the nation's
ports between 2007 and 2009 was nearly US$15 million. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's main port for imports and exports and the country's only
deep water port is the Corinto Port situated in the department of
Chinandega on the Pacific coast approximately 125 kilometres from
Managua. Like the other ports in Nicaragua, Corinto Port was in a
seriously
deteriorated state in 2007 due to a lack of appropriate maintenance
work
during previous administrations. <br>
      <br>
Among other maintenance and repair work at Corinto since 2007 the EPN
has built two new platform scales which help to avoid congestion of
trucks and vehicles that come and go to load and unload goods. The EPN
has also built and equipped installations two kilometres before the
port where companies can carry out all the necessary bureaucratic
transactions to do with exporting and importing goods prior to reaching
the main installations. The construction of this "antepuerto" has
significantly reduced congestion at the port itself as well as making
life simpler for export and import companies. <br>
      <br>
Like the Corinto Port the Arlen Siu Port, which is situated in El Rama
on the Caribbean Coast and which is currently the main export / import
port on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast, was also in a state of disrepair
when the FSLN came to power three and a half years ago. Since then, teh
EPN
has invested nearly US$5 million modernizing and expanding of
this port, which now has the capacity to receive 2,500 ton
ships.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Newly built piers and ports
support local industry and encourage tourism</span><br>
      <br>
In terms of the construction of new ports, the EPN has built four new
piers and two new ports since 2007. The four new piers are situated in
the Gulf of Fonseca (in the the north-west of Nicaragua) in the
department
of Chinandega. These piers were built following the signing of the
Gulf of Fonseca Accords between Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador in
2007 in which the three countries agreed to encourage economic and
infrastructural development in the gulf region. <br>
      <br>
These four new piers have been of immense benefit to local fishermen
(fishing is the main source of employment in the area) forming a stable
infrastructural base allowing local small, medium and large fishing
companies to confidently invest.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The two new ports built by the EPN since 2007 are the Salvador Allende
Port in Managua's Malecon area and the San Francisco Libre Port in the
town of the same name.&nbsp; Both are situated on Lake Xolotlán
(Lake Managua). <br>
      <br>
The Salvador Allende port is mainly aimed at reactivating economic
activity by encouraging tourism in this part of Managua. Similarly the
San Francisco Libre Port is aimed at
realizing the town's tourist potential as well as serving as a key
communication link with the capital and potentially with other towns
situated on the shores of Lake Xolotlán.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bilwi, recipient of the three
biggest infrastructure projects since
2007 </span><br>
      <br>
EPN's biggest investment under way at present is focused on the town
of
Bilwi on Nicaragua's north Caribbean Coast. The town's port, which was
originally inaugurated during the first Sandinista government of the
1980s fell into disrepair after it was privatized in the 1990s. <br>
      <br>
Then, in September 2007, the category five hurricane Felix which hit
Nicaragua's Caribbean Coast causedsuch serious damaged to the port
that its quay
actually collapsed. It has since been rebuilt, however, and is today
fully operative<br>
      <br>
At the beginning of 2010 preparation work to drastically expand the
port increasing its receiving capacity from 2,500 ton ships to 15,000
ton ships by 2012. This project, which has a calculated value of US$22
million, is being funding by ALBA and carried out with technical
assistance from Cuba and Venezuela. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Bilwi is also the recipient of the biggest airport investment since
2007 with the ongoing project to modernize and expand the local Bilwi
airport. Until now this airport has only had the capacity to receive
domestic flights. Once the current project, which contemplates a total
investment of US$35 million, is completed later this year, though, the
government hopes Bilwi will be able to establish itself as one of the
main reference international airports in the Caribbean. <br>
      <br>
The logic behind the FSLN government's strategic decision to
concentrate such
significant investment in the Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region
(RAAN), of which Bilwi is the capital, is to do with the fact that it
is the most impoverished region of Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
The vast majority of the region's 250,000 inhabitants work in
agriculture and fishing but, as a result of different structural
factors, are rarely able to earn enough to free themselves from extreme
poverty. These structural
factors include and are exacerbated by the almost complete lack of
infrastructure investment in the region during previous
governments.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EPN plans to construct a deep
water port at Monkey Point</span><br>
      <br>
During an interview on Channel 4's "En Vivo con Alberto Mora" program
in January of this year, EPN's president, Virgilio Silva, spoke about
the company's plans for a deep water port at Monkey Point south of
Bluefields on the
Caribbean Coast.<br>
      <br>
The lack of a deep water port on Nicaragua's eastern coast
significantly increases the cost of both importing and exporting goods
to and from some of the countries with whom Nicaragua has a great
amount of trade - for example European countries, Venezuela and the
east
coast of the US - given that products going to or coming from these
countries have to go via the Panama canal to Nicaragua's Corinto Port
or travel to Nicaragua by road from
Honduras or Costa Rica, which both have deep water ports on the
Caribbean Sea.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Virgilio Silva explains that Nicaraguan exporters currently pay between
US$1,300 and US$1,500 for each container they export via Costa Rica or
Honduras. With a deep water port at Monkey Point this sum would be
reduced by US$500. <br>
      <br>
Another damaging repercussion of the lack of a deep water port on the
Caribbean Coast is that the cost of fuel increases significantly.
Indeed, as a direct consequence of the lack of such a port, fuel in
Nicaragua is more expensive than in any other Central American
country.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
EPN plans to carry out the construction of this port with ALBA funds.
At present the bidding process for the mega project has been held
up, however, due to the legislative's delay in passing the New Ports
Law.
