<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A very good afternoon, Compañera, and a very, very good afternoon, Beloved Families of this Nicaragua that fills us all with Pride, because we are a Heroic, Combative, Industrious, Hard-working People... We are like Carlos. We are a People capable of winning in all circumstances... A capable People, a People with Soul, a People with Spirit, a People with History and, therefore too, a People with Memory.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Tomorrow we will be paying tribute to the Tayacán, Victor over every all forms of Death, because Death does comes in very many forms, and when we are able to differentiate between Death and Life, clearly, when we know what Life is and why we came to this Plane of Life... What have we come here for? We come to learn, we come to strive, we are here to overcome.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When we know how to differentiate what Life is, we know that we are capable of victory over any attempt to sow Death.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Here We Go Onward. We are in the World and of the World, so we know where Life leads and what it brings, that everything is incessant Change, and we also know how with that Brave, Dignified, Free, Sovereign People, of Sandino, of Zeledón, of Andrés, of Carlos, we have been able to make our way along all the Roads traveled with the Immense Spirit of those who are Our Eternally Brave.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Existence is change. The Times, the Winds, all these things announce to us what we must know... Why? Because we are the protagonists of these changes. Amid so much Struggle, so much Suffering, but also so much Strength of Hope, we Peoples continue to make our way with the Joy of the Soul, living, feeling, and doing... Doing! Comandante Carlos, we do our duty!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the Face of Great Battles, Much Learning, Great Experiences among avenues broad and long, as the Eternal Undefeated President of Dignity, Salvador Allende, said. We know how to recognize the terrain ahead and we know the steps we must take, Always Onward and Always Further On.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Among all the Wisdoms, ours is there, Nicaraguan, by the Grace of God...! A deeply Spiritual Wisdom, Wisdom and Serenity, Wisdom and Confidence, that is Hope and Certainty; Wisdom to continue fighting the Battles with the calm and courageous Strength of Love and Honor, with the Glory of this Continent, of Our America-Caribbean, of our Heroes, and of all those who inhabit this Sacred Geography, where we work... What do we work on? The Paths of Peace!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We Cultivate Peace, Harmony, Rights... Harmony, in Character and in the Certainty that every History has its Memory, and that is precisely why, because we have Memory and we have History, we know that to live is to Overcome, and that to Overcome is imperative, it is that inalienable Right of those of us who have faith and who love Freedom and our Free Nations; we have faith, we love our protagonists making their way, a way that is also fraternal and complementary, because we are heading towards the Better World that already exists, for we are already in that Better World... The Better World where we consolidate our Sovereign and deeply, irrevocably, invariably, irreversibly Free Destinies.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This is how we are, every day strengthening that insuperable, indomitable Character of Patriotic Love, of Freedom, Dignity and Fraternity!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And today, Compañeras and Compañeros, November 7th, our Foreign Minister, Compañero Valdrack Jaentschke has sent a letter to the Foreign Ministers of the SICA Member Countries, with a copy of course to the Heads of State of our SICA Region.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In this letter we can inform you that our Government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Minister is the one who writes, greets the Brothers and Sisters of the Governments and Chancelleries of the SICA Countries, in reference to an offensive communication sent yesterday from a so-called Executive Directorate. Called, yes, a very strange way to be presenting SICA which still lacks its Secretary General. So by whose decision? Well, that we know, we do know.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">SICA's General Secretariat currently has no Secretary General, however there is a so-called Executive Directorate, and the letter signed by that Executive Directorate communicates a request for the Governments of the SICA countries to analyze a proposed Work Agenda and a Draft Budget, worth paying attention to this, a Budget for the General Secretariat that does not exist because it has no Secretary General, and they want this agenda and budget to be analyzed by an Executive Directorate which simply cannot do so, according to all SICA's own Regulations... with regard to the agenda and budget for the coming year.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our Government categorically denounces and rejects any attempt at usurpation, because that is what this is, of the figure of the SICA's Secretary General by this so-called Executive Directorate which is merely an internal Administrative Office and has no competence to exercise powers that correspond only to SICA's Member States and to the coordination exercised by SICA's Secretary General.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Nor is this so-called Executive Directorate authorized to communicate with Member States. It simply should not do so. They are usurping the role of SICA's General Secretariat. They cannot communicate on any political, administrative, or operational matter, because that is the exclusive purview of the Secretary General of SICA.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our Government reiterates its position rejecting the aforementioned Administrative Office submitting a Work Agenda to SICA's Member States... How can that be? And a budget. But for what expenses if there is no General Secretariat? A body, an entity currently without its Secretary General.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We also reiterate that this Administrative Office should refrain from continuing to send communications to Member States on matters pertaining to SICA... They are usurping! We denounce it and we reject it! Being contrary to all the Regulations and Protocols that govern SICA's institutional life, they are, in effect, naming themselves as the Secretary General... How can that be? Since the Head of SICA established by the Tegucigalpa Protocol is not simply appointed, therefore they cannot continue communicating in any way at all to Member States in relation to SICA matters.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">So the appeal is made to the Governments of these SICA Countries, to our Brothers and Sisters, to urgently restore the institutionality of this Regional Space and to comply with the Tegucigalpa Protocol and the Presidential Agreements signed by the Member States.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Complying in that way with the Regulations, the Protocols, with all the established provisions for the operation of our System will mean that we are Moving Onward; doing otherwise is to commit fraud. It is fraudulent to usurp the Secretary General.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">For this Executive to replace the General Secretariat is usurpation, we denounce it, we reject it and we call on all of us to overcome this tendency which does not correspond with what our System should be.</p>
