<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Good afternoon, Compañera. Content and grateful to the God of All Triumphs, because we are making our way, because we are combative and He gives us the Strength of Soul, of Spirit, of Heart, to strive, to labor, to overcome, in all circumstances, so long as we are Lovers of Peace, full of Good Will, of Affection, of Respect, and believing and creating Good for Everyone.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And well, we are on our way, heading towards the 45/19 Anniversary. So Many Years, So Many Struggles, So Many Hopes, So Much Devotion and Dedication, and we can well say, So Much Sacrifice... Although we know that giving up One's Life for one's Country is a Heroic and Sublime Act, we see it, we feel it as a Sacrifice, and more than a Sacrifice as a Foundation Stone. It means that in every corner of a Nation like ours there are Temples, Temples of Courage, of Dignity, Shrine after Shrine of Courage, Dignity, Heroism, Resistance, of Struggle and Triumphs... Of so many Victories!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">What a blessing to have been born here, in this Country so full of Love, because everything that has been done and is being done, all the Dedication, all the Devotion, all the Affection that makes us give our Lives for the Country, all of that is God's Blessing, it is Privilege and it is National Pride.<br />
 </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And here we are advancing with that same Spirit, knowing that in these Times of Peace, we owe to all those who have gone ahead of us the Duty, the Responsibility to consolidate and defend that Peace, as the only thing that allows the Progress, the Advancement, that Nicaraguan Families have dreamed of, long for, and deserve.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Now, Tuesday, July 9th we are receiving confirmation from all the many hundreds of Brothers and Sisters who will visit us, Student Leaders, Youth Leaders, Social Leaders, many Communicators, many Artists, many Brothers and Sisters, all of them in solidarity and admirers of the Strength of Spirit of our Ancestors who are also our Guides and Guiding Spirits.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We have that Pride, that Honor, to be descendants of Heroic, Worthy Original Peoples... Intelligent, Brilliant Native Peoples... Original Peoples of Formidable Culture, that the enemy sought to crush, and could not, since we are the Heirs of those formidable Cultures which over Time, of course, transform and merge with other formidable Cultures.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">So we are made then of Cultures of Light, of Life, of True Truths, of so much Affection and always with pride in that Heritage of Our Native Peoples, our Undefeated Generals, our Heroic Resistance, Heroic and Victorious Resistance.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">In all those moments when voracious Empires have wanted to annihilate us, conquer us, make us bend, destroy us, They Have Not Prevailed, Nor Will They! At all times they have tried to kill the Nicaraguan Soul, and here we are, increasingly aware of being this Great, Proud People, with a Great Spirit, a Great Heart, Great Soul, Great Courage bred of so many Struggles and Victories.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Neither Could They, Nor Will They Prevail...! We can say that categorically, because we have come through so much, and there are so many of us, and we are Going Onwards in such a way towards the Progress and Prosperity, that will leave behind the Misery that was imposed on us... and that they want to keep imposing on us, because they are still there, the villains, the crooks, the criminals, the same old outlaws they have always been, always cursing, always beside themselves, because that's how they look. They are losers always, simply because they are losers. Forever unsuccessful, more so than ever since they failed in their attempt to subdue this Great People, which Neither Sells Out, Nor Surrenders, Ever!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">We are the Magnificent, Formidable, Great People of Darío, just imagine what Darío means to the World; the Great People of Rubén Darío, the Great People of Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino, the Great People of Benjamín Zeledón, the People of Andrés Castro, of the Generals, General Estrada, José Dolores, and of the General Staff of the Army In Defense of National Sovereignty.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Our Sandino, our General Estrada, those Immense Generals, Pedro Altamirano, Miguel Ángel Ortez, Umanzor, all of them in the Firmament of Heroes, who give this Nation a true Sense of Nation.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Anyone who is not proud of what we have done throughout our history, of how we have resisted in order to overcome, really has no Nation. That's why some of them are stateless people, because they have no Nation. They are lackeys, servile, slaves of mind, of conscience. They are "house children” to use that term used in times past to distinguish between biological children, and employees people had in their houses.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">It wasn't allowed to say they were slaves... or servants, so they were called, "house children ” humble people picked out for service. But in this case they are not humble, since some of them, perhaps half caught up in selfishness and greed want to copy the pattern of their patrons, without realizing that nothing could make them the same.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And those servants, slaves, lackeys, in servitude to empire, they have no Nation, obviously. They Have No Nation! That is why they hate their own people... What a terrible thing! That's why they hate the land they came from... How terrible! To hate where they are from, where they come from... How terrible!</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Imagine, cursing one's self, one's blood, one's nerves, one's roots... Blasphemous and stateless, they wish always for evil. And after all, as we say every day, whoever wishes evil, attracts evil, this is a Law of Life, it's natural. If I am filled with evil, what I attract is evil, I cannot attract anything else, because I cannot be anything else, nor are they anything else.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">Those who are full of Evil who wish for Evil, are Evil, an Evil that People curse, an Evil from which People recoil, an Evil which People reject, because in truth Evil is Wretchedness, Human Misery, so one turns away and recoils saying: No, I want nothing to do with that Human Misery. We have the duty and the right to transcend it as Human Beings.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And even so, in truth those of us who really love Nicaragua and who live as the Heritage of so many Great Nicaraguans, we know how to Go Onward, that in Unity and knowing how to work Together, All Together, we can live safely, calmly, striving, laboring, prospering. How so? In Peace. How so? By defending Peace. How so? By generating more and more Harmony every day, through Respect, Brother and Sisterhood, through Christian, Socialist and Solidarity inspired Love.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">This way Evil cannot reach us. Evil is, thank God, banished from this Nation, Blessed and Always Free, banished in all its forms, even of those who disguised themselves as Religious, because a Religious person cannot be evil. And here we have come across really evil people, disguised as Religious, but they deceive no one, that's what Sandino said: Over time you cannot fool anyone. And it's True.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">And that is why we feel even more fulfilled today, near this 45/19 Anniversary, because we know we have come so far, we have faced so much and fought so much, that we deserve the best, first of all Peace, and also first of all Love in its largest sense, the Infinite Sense of Family and Community.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">45/19, the Nation... 45/19, Unity... 45/19, Solidarity... 45/19, Joy and Happiness... 45/19, a Patriotic Nation and a Revolution. And here we are heading towards that 45/19 Anniversary with More and More Achievements in the service of our People, because they are all Triumphs of the People, of the Selfless Labor of every day. And all that returns to the People, because whoever does Good, receives Good, by Right.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">That's why we insist, More Hospitals, More Health Centers, More and More Schools, Universities, More and More Technologies for Production, More and More Roads, Streets, Bridges... How wonderful those Bridges! Who thought they'd ever see them? We used to say, But When? Ah, but now we see them, because when there is Peace and Unity everything is possible, because everything is possible with the Power of Love. Not Hatred. Hatred destroys, Hatred is infamous, which is why it is even more infamous when such Hatred comes from the mouths and tongues of those said to represent Christ Jesus. What a disgrace! One that is an even greater evil.</p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>

<p lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0cm" xml:lang="en-US">More Streets, More Housing, More Productive Businesses, More Work, More Commerce, More Production... Everything is possible with the Power of Love, and this is how we Go Onward, praising and thanking God every day, because it is in His Name and for His Glory that we make our way. The Glory of God is a People serene, secure, and aware that it is possible to Go Onward, Always Further On, in Unity, Brother and Sisterhood, Solidarity and Joy.</p>
