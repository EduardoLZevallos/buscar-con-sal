<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY AT THE RECEPTION<br />
FOR THE REOPENING OF THE EMBASSY OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA</strong></p>

<p><strong>Chancellor Denis Moncada Colindres</strong></p>

<p><strong>31st December, 2021, 12:00 hours</strong></p>

<p><br />
Excellency Brother Yu Bo, Representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China;</p>

<p>Fellow Comrades of the Cabinet of our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, Powers of the State of Nicaragua and its Institutions;</p>

<p>Dear Fellow Members of the General Command of the Nicaraguan Army;</p>

<p>Dear Fellow Members of the Directorate of the National Police;</p>

<p>Excellencies, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, International Organizations and Cooperation Agencies accredited in our Country;</p>

<p>Friends of the Media for Citizens Power;</p>

<p>Our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity and the Nicaraguan People, together with the People and Government of China, joyfully celebrate this memorable day of reopening of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Nicaragua. Two peoples who have fought for their National liberation with perseverance, achieving progressive victories for Peace, Prosperity, the eradication of poverty and the harmonious coexistence of all Peoples and all Nations.</p>

<p>Comrade Yu Bo: We convey to you, to your People and your Government, the fraternal greetings of our President, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, our Vice President, Comrade Rosario Murillo Zambrana and the Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p>The close friendship between Nicaragua and China dates back a long time. We reestablished diplomatic relations during the Sandinista Popular Revolution in 1985, and although they were interrupted by neoliberal governments, the ideological and political affinity, friendly relations and exchanges between our Peoples, persisted and grew.</p>

<p>This 9th December, 2021 will be remembered in the history of Nicaragua and China. On that special day, our Government issued a declaration recognizing that there is only One China in the world and the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate Government that represents all of China.</p>

<p>Thus, we resume a new stage of diplomatic relations, friendship and collaboration that allows us to develop strategic investments, strengthening our Relations in all fields: Science, Technologies, Education, Health, Art, Culture, Sports, Media, Transportation, Information and Communication Technologies, Investments, Projects, Commerce, Defense, Security, and everything that promotes Understanding, Comprehension, and new and higher levels of Fraternal Coordination, in order to continue fighting the necessary Battles, that are essential for a World with Rights for All.</p>

<p>The People's Republic of China and Nicaragua have maintained, through the Sandinista National Liberation Front and the Communist Party of China, friendship and fraternal and revolutionary brotherhood. The reestablishment of historic diplomatic relations between Nicaragua and China has the support of the majority of the Nicaraguan People and the Chinese People, advancing towards a New World Order, that is multipolar, with Peace, Social Justice, Equity, Development and Progress for Humanity.</p>

<p>Both our Peoples and Governments have developed relations based on the Principles of the UN Charter and International Law, mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, the dignity and territorial integrity of States, their right to development and to have social security systems, persisting in the resolution of disputes by peaceful means.</p>

<p>We reject the threat or use of force as a means of conflict resolution, as well as unilateral coercive measures contrary to international law and the UN Charter, which threaten the sovereignty and stability of our peoples. We reject interference in internal affairs under the pretext of ethnic minority issues. It continues to be necessary for the international community to foster a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice and mutually beneficial cooperation, and to jointly form a new international order that is more just and equitable.</p>

<p>Our bilateral relations are consolidated, with cooperation projects, commercial exchanges and strategic investments.</p>

<p>This process of strengthening our relationships is expressed through:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua of 9th December, 2021, recognizing the principle of One China and the legitimate Government of the People's Republic of China.<br />
	 </li>
	<li>The Joint Communiqué between the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Reestablishment of Diplomatic Relations. Signed by Comrade Laureano Ortega and Comrade Ma Zhaoxu on 10th December, 2021 in Tianjin.<br />
	 </li>
	<li>The Cooperation Agreement between the China Media Group and the Nicaraguan Council for Communications and Citizenship. Signed on 15th December, 2021.<br />
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>In her daily address, Comrade Vice President Rosario Murillo has expressed: “We are moving forward promoting more communication, more understanding, more scientific, cultural, social and community exchanges, we are a great family in this world, we are in our Nicaragua, a great family and we are getting evermore closer in the search for a better, more just, united, and peaceful world... How many advances, how many victories, the restitution of relations between transcendental revolutions such as the People's Revolution and the Communist Party of China and the Sandinista Revolution and the Sandinista National Liberation Front and now, with the governments of the People's Republic of China and Nicaragua; this is historic.”</p>

<p>We appreciate the support we have received from China in the year 2021, through the donation of one million Sinopharm vaccines to cope with the pandemic COVID-19. At this time, when the entire planet is devastated by this Pandemic, the solidarity and brotherhood of China has also been evidenced through its unconditional contributions to sister countries in different parts of the globe.</p>

<p>Dear friend and Brother Yu Bo, Representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, we ask you to convey to your People and Government, to your President, His Excellency Comrade Xi Jinping, to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, our deep appreciation for these expressions of solidarity and brotherhood.</p>

<p>We are sure that we will continue working together, strengthening more each day, the fraternal bonds of friendship, cooperation, investment, expanding communication channels with the Belt and Road Initiative, strengthening Peace, stability, Security, development and progress for the mutual benefit of our peoples and for humanity.</p>

<p>We Nicaraguans, in this Dignified, Sovereign and Free Motherland, feel healthy pride in formally reestablishing historical bonds and relations at all levels, with the People's Republic of China and with the reopening of this Embassy.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Yu Bo and Fellow Representatives of the People's Republic of China, You are Welcome to our Nicaragua, Blessed and Always Free, Motherland of Sandino, of Rubén Darío, with the certainty that both our countries have a future of successes and victories ahead of us with fraternal relations between Nicaragua and the People's Republic of China.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.</p>
