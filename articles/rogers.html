Last week's Christian Science Monitor article by Central America based
US journalist Tim Rogers, &#8220;Eyeing Middle East, Nicaragua's Ortega
quashes weekend protests&#8221;, offers a perfect parody of&nbsp; accurate
reporting. Ostensibly presenting a true and fair view of events,
Rogers' fake journalism repeats and reinforces a simple anti-Sandinista
propaganda
message.<br>
      <br>
The corporate and much alternative media in the United States and its
allied countries persistently deliver two false propaganda messages on
Nicaragua. Firstly, they insist relentlessly that Daniel Ortega is a
corrupt, repressive tyrant. Secondly, they claim there is mass popular
discontent in Nicaragua with the government. In both cases, the reverse
is true. <br>
      <br>
The Christian Science Monitor propaganda piece continued this long
standing, cynical psy-warfare offensive against Nicaragua's very
successful Sandinista government. Subsequently, Rogers' article&nbsp;
appeared on several corporate Internet news sites including Yahoo!
News. That repetition confirms the long prevalent tendency for Western
corporate media of all kinds to offer as &#8220;news&#8221;&nbsp; what amounts to
virtual
fabrication almost entirely disconnected from real events. Rogers'
article makes heavy use of emotive rhetoric, false assumptions and
downright untruth. <br>
      <br>
He demonstrates his own political bias by only quoting four
unrepresentative Nicaraguan opposition figures from the same political
current. His coverage of the two political marches that took place in
Managua on Saturday April 2nd is so far-fetched that he manages to give
the totally false impression that, soon, Nicaragua is likely to explode
in a fury of popular discontent against a paranoid and thoroughly
undemocratic regime. To give this fantasy some spurious topicality,
Rogers invokes an absurd comparison&nbsp; with events in North Africa.<br>
      <br>
Police repression in which only police officers are injured<br>
      <br>
According to Rogers, last Saturday's opposition march, which was
organized by US and European government funded &#8220;civil society&#8221; NGOs and
the main slogan of which was an anti Daniel Ortega slogan, was
&#8220;blocked&#8221; by &#8220;heavily armed riot police.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
In actual fact, far from the police blocking the protest march, the
participants of the march themselves refused to follow the route
stipulated for them by the police because it differed from the route
they had requested. The riot police only arrived on the scene after
participants brutally attacked an unarmed cordon of female police
officers with sticks, stones and pepper spray. <br>
      <br>
As a result of this attack, 18 police officers ended up in hospital,
two in intensive care. Despite the&nbsp; violence of the demonstrators,
the riot police did not use any form of crowd control (no tear gas, no
water cannons, no rubber bullets) against the violent &#8220;civil society&#8221;
opposition protesters, nor did they make any arrests. <br>
      <br>
This sort of extreme police restraint would be unthinkable in pretty
much any other country in the world. Apparently, though, Rogers
considered those details insufficiently newsworthy to be included in
his article.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Roger's &#8220;wave of popular discontent&#8221;<br>
      <br>
In the parallel reality in which journalists like Rogers float
cynically through their professional careers, it is not just logical
but actually quite obvious that the course of events surrounding this
opposition march in Managua on April 2nd confirm what in the real
Nicaragua is a laughable theory; that President Ortega and his
government have demonstrated &#8220;paranoia&#8221; and &#8220;insecurity&#8221; in the face of
&#8220;a wave of popular discontent&#8221; comparable to &#8220;recent uprisings that
ousted leaders in Egypt and Tunisia.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
A key aspect of Roger's hypothesis regarding the current political
situation in Nicaragua is the bogus idea that the source of nonexistent
widespread wrath against President Ortega is (what the corporate media
would have us believe as) the FSLN government's regular violation of
Nicaraguan law. <br>
      <br>
Rogers states as fact, for example, that Ortega's candidacy in this
year's presidential elections is &#8220;counter-constitutional.&#8221; In the name
of unbiased journalism, though, it would seem reasonable to expect
Rogers to at least mention the existence of a Supreme Court of Justice
ruling by the full court ,including both Sandinista and opposition
magistrates, stating the exact opposite &#8211; that reelection bids in
Nicaragua are legal and constitutional. <br>
      <br>
Undeterred by inconvenient facts like these or by other inconsistencies
in the anti-FSLN, anti-reality storyline (like the pitiful turnout for
the opposition march - 2,000 according to the march organizers, 600
according to independent national media like 100% Noticias) Rogers
insists on doing his bit to advance the ridiculous theory about an
impending mass popular uprising against Nicaragua's Sandinista
government. <br>
      <br>
Rogers' four sources represent 1% public opinion in Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
But then Rogers' barmy conclusions appear to be based entirely on an
utterly limited and 99% unrepresentative sample of national opinion:
that of four individuals who, at first glance, might give the
impression of representing a wide range of progressive opinion in
Nicaragua - &#8220;Sandinista dissidents&#8221; Monica Baltodano and Mois&eacute;s
Hassan, &#8220;Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights representative&#8221; Gonzalo
Carri&oacute;n, and &#8220;feminist leader&#8221; Azahalea Sol&iacute;s. <br>
      <br>
For anyone relatively well informed about Nicaraguan current
affairs, it is immediately obvious that all four sources are
ideologically aligned with &#8211; and, in the case of Baltodano,
Sol&iacute;s and Hassan, intimately linked to &#8211;&nbsp; the tiny
Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) which according to recent opinion
polls commands just 1% support among the population
(www.cidgallup.com/Documentos/Aleman_y_PLC.pdf). Currently the MRS
forms part of the extreme right wing PLI-UNE alliance. <br>
      <br>
"Silent majority" versus on the street FSLN support<br>
      <br>
The arguments put forward by the elitist body of opinion these
individuals represent necessarily depend on the concept of a &#8220;silent
majority&#8221; (a concept which was famously invoked by former US president
Nixon in a speech intended to counteract the effect of massive protests
against the Vietnam War). <br>
      <br>
In this case, we are asked to take seriously the idea that the
interests and opinions represented by a small group of failed
right-wing politicians and unaccountable &#8220;civil society&#8221; organizations
concur with those of a majority of Nicaraguans. That majority, somehow
unknown to themselves, have to be represented, in some vague and
unaccountable way, by a tiny, self-appointed right-wing minority. <br>
      <br>
Rogers and the individuals he quotes deal with the problematic
numerical turnout issue &#8211; which has the potential to completely
undermine their hypothesis &#8211; by claiming with no support whatsoever
that the number of people who would like to have taken part in the
opposition march was much greater but that many were put off by the
threat of police repression (sic). <br>
      <br>
Simultaneously, Rogers undermines the impressive turnout for the pro
government March and Festival for Peace organized by the Sandinista
Youth organization, with claims that a significant number of the
approximately 100,000 participants were state workers and secondary
school students obliged to take part under the respective threats of
losing their jobs and failing their exams. <br>
      <br>
This inherently weak argument (since the 1980s the FSLN has
consistently demonstrated its ability&nbsp; to mobilize impressive
turnouts at its public events and marches, whether or not the party is
in power) is weakened further by Roger's striking failure to come up
with a single source (anonymous or otherwise) to back up these claims. <br>
      <br>
Corporate media's interdependent web of disinformation<br>
      <br>
In short, the main arguments contained within the article are entirely
interdependent on each other within the apparently seamless web of
dishonest, reality-detached, anti-FSLN propaganda which journalists
like Rogers and a broad range of media outlets like the Christian
Science Monitor (and the New York Times, the Washington Post, McClatchy
News, the Guardian, Le Monde, El Pa&iacute;s, Counterpunch, ZNet etc.)
have been responsible for creating during the last few years: <br>
      <br>
Without the lie that President Ortega violates the constitution, the
false claim that he is authoritarian and dictatorial falls apart:
Without the lie that Ortega is authoritarian and dictatorial the false
claim that there is widespread popular discontent falls apart: Without
the lie that the FSLN government faces widespread popular discontent
the false claim that the government feels obliged to resort to
repressive police measures falls apart: Without the lie that the
government resorts to repressive police measures the idea that the
government needs to justify unjustifiable and illegal acts falls
apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Journalists like Rogers, in his latest article about Nicaragua, are
more than thoroughly disrespectful of the principles of unbiased,
independent journalism &#8211; they are bound invariably to betray those
principles in order to carry any credibility at all in the corporate
propaganda media for which they work.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Rogers' article is yet another example of how depressingly wide the gap
between liberal thinkers in the North and progressive movements in the
South has become in recent years. The predictable electoral battering
Rogers' preferred political option in Nicaragua looks set to suffer
in&nbsp; this year's November nacional elections will bear testimony to
this. <br>
      <br>
As Nicaraguan writer Carlos Escorcia Polanco points out in his recent
article "The Ortega 'Dictatorship'": &#8220;Thanks to the wonders of the
&#8220;free&#8221; press controlled by giant multinational media corporations,
international public opinion will never know that the Sandinista march
&#8230; was 20 times bigger than the opposition's march &#8230; [But then]
international public opinion won't have the opportunity to vote during
the November 6th 2011 elections.&#8221; <br>
