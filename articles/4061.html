<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>POWER TO THE FREE PEOPLES!</strong></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Remarks by Compañera Rosario Murillo</strong></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Noon of April 24th 2024</strong></p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Today is Wednesday, April 24th and we are, as always, on a Combative footing, those Noble, Courageous Struggles that we wage daily in Unity, Strengthening the Common Good. In Love, in Brother and Sisterhood, in Solidarity. Working in Safety, Joy and Peace. On Roads, along Routes, of Prosperity.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Last night we traveled to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a fraternal Country and People, that People of the Eternal Comandante, that People of Bolívar, of Chávez, of Nicolás, that Country that we always visit with Giant Love, the Giant Love that the Free Peoples of the World have for us... Our President, Comandante Daniel, headed the Delegation attending the ALBA-TCP Summit of Heads of State and Government, which brings together Venezuela, of course, which coordinates it and presides; heroic Cuba; our Nicaragua; Bolivia, Grenada, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia, in this Year of so many Struggles, of so many Battles, achieving so many Victories. Continuing to achieve Victories from our Noble Alliance of Solidarity, Respect, Brother and Ssterhood and Complementarity.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our Media Coordinator, Compañero Daniel Edmundo Ortega Murillo, also traveled; the Advisor Compañero Rafael Ortega; and Members of our Government Cabinet, who always work in coordination with our Sister Venezuela... Heroic, Noble, Triumphant Venezuela!</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And well, we will be watching for the transmission that TELESUR will make of the Speeches, the Messages, of the Heads of State and Government who gather there to Songs of Peace, Life and Hope.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the Free Peoples of the World come together, it is to work ever more for Peace, and for the World, this other World that we already inhabit, a Multipolar World, of respectful, fruitful, positive associations. And we come together to celebrate that we are Great and Free Peoples. And we are meeting to continue working, strengthening that World that we have dreamed so much and which we are now making a reality, inhabiting it as its rightful owners.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, too, meetings convened by Compañero General Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, are being held in St. Petersburg. There is our Compañero Special Adviser to Comandante Daniel, to the President, to the People-President, for a relationship that grows every day, a historical relationship of respect, of trust, of mutual work, always for Peace in the World that we have been creating. A different world. A World we want of Peace and Development, of Justice and True Truths. A Better World.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Attending the meeting called by Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, General Patrushev, as we said, Laureano Ortega, Presidential Adviser and Special Representative of the President for Affairs with Russia with Commissioner General Zhukov Serrano, Deputy Director of the Police; Colonel Álvaro Martín Peña, Second Head of the Information Directorate for the Defense of the Nicaraguan Army; the Compañera Celia Reyes, Deputy General Director of the Nicaraguan Institute of Telecommunications and Post (TELCOR), and the Writer, Compañera Alba Azucena Torres, Ambassador of our Nicaragua to the Russian Federation.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Issues and Projects of our Bilateral Cooperation have been discussed, especially that Cooperation that is committed to a World of Peace and that is committed to strengthening Security, such that we have reconfirmed mutual support in all fields.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This meeting between Nicaragua, our People, the Russian Federation, the Great Russian People, took place within the framework of the Twelfth Conference of High-level Representatives for Security Affairs, which is being held in St. Petersburg. And the Nicaraguan Delegation has also participated in the Third Multilateral Meeting of the Working Group made up of Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia, reaffirming common positions to confront the destructive hegemonism of the United States and its European allies.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">So, Compañer@s, we also want to emphasize that the participation has been complete, there is the Minister of the Interior of Cuba, Compañero Lázaro Alberto Álvaro Casas; Major General José Adelino Ornelas Ferreira, Chief of the General Staff of the Command of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, and Compañero Hugo Moldiz, Advisor to the President of Bolivia. Comrade Laureano Ortega has been there representing us.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then, Compañer@s, we are also watching today, as we were saying, first of all the Speeches of the Presidents who have gathered in that beautiful Caracas. And we talked and are talking, wherever we go we discuss the same thing: How to strengthen the Decisions of Peace, of Dialogue, that will lead us to a Fully Multipolar World. We are already inhabiting it. A Complete World, we want it to be Complete, working together against all the evils that Empires seek to keep imposing on us, including the ignominious Fascism. That Fascism, which has entailed millions upon millions of victims, offending and outraging the entire Human Community with its segregationist, racist, discriminatory, criminal and offensive postulates against Human Dignity. The Bravery and Heroism of the Great Peoples of the Soviet Union defeated them in May 1945. We will soon celebrate the Anniversary of the Victory... The Victory of the USSR, of Russia, in the Great Patriotic War, Victory over Fascism, unfortunately its remnants abide, and we must keep fighting so as to keep Overcoming.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In those Meetings we also talked about aggression, about defending ourselves against aggression, misleadingly called Sanctions, which in fact constitute barbaric and savage, Unilateral, Arbitrary, Illegal Measures, against Brave Peoples, who “neither sell out, nor surrender.” Because we are not selling out, nor are we surrendering, but rather in Fraternal Unity we continue to struggle so as to inhabit to the fullest, as we said, the New World and to continue creating its Future of Respect, Harmony, Sovereignty, Security, Justice and Well-being for the Human Family.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">At the United Nations we participate in all the Meetings that are held, and then also at the International Court of Justice in other Events, in support of the Heroic Struggles of the Palestinian People, faced with the cruelty, hatred and genocide of the Government of Israel, which incredibly receives more support to continue with those crimes against humanity that impact the Human Community. Because the astonished world, the astonished peoples, in the face of such barbarism, speak out as we speak out, demonstrate as we demonstrate, shout out as we shout out, in the streets of so many Cities and in all Forums and Organizations, condemning support for massacre, savagery, brutality, hatred.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Those who suffered Nazism in the flesh, and Fascism, with millions upon millions of victims sacrificed by deranged, delusional, absurd minds, today also, incredibly, are the delusional, the deranged and the absurd executors, grossly copying the atrocities that they themselves suffered at the hands of those who today support them with weapons, ammunition and implements of mass destruction, annihilating Life in all its forms, and blatantly ignoring the Human Rights about which the sponsors of those crimes against humanity boast so much, from one lie to the next.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And those falsehoods, from one lie to the next, they brandish as political weapons against governments and Peoples that neither accept being their servants, nor allow themselves to be dominated, nor are docile. Because we are not docile, we do not serve them, we are not their servants, we do not allow ourselves to be dominated, so with us they take an interest and find it convenient to talk about Human Rights, but they become blind, deaf and dumb in the face of a genocide which the world’s media transmit daily as it is committed, a genocide we condemn, as offended Human Beings, we condemn the genocide that is committed against the Families and the Brave People of Palestine.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The People, our People, the Government of Nicaragua, in multiple Forums and Events, defend that Fraternal People and their Right to be recognized as a State in their Lands, Lands that belong to them by History and Memory, since Biblical Times, and before. And in these days we have been in Trinidad and Tobago, as Vice-Presidents of the United Nations Committee on Palestine, always in full and powerful defense of Justice, Reason and the Wise and Sensitive Heart that we must present as the Foundation of everything we claim, of everything we demand for those massacred Families, that People of so many Lucid, Strong, Battles. Our Ambassador, Comrade Jaime Hermida, was there in Trinidad and Tobago, representing us as Vice-Presidents of the United Nations Committee on Palestine.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once again too we greet and welcome the various Delegations that visit us: One from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, arrived yesterday, headed by the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia concurrent to our Nicaragua; to the Delegation that visits us from the People's Republic of China, headed by the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Commission and Governor of the People's Government of Chuxiong Prefecture; the Vice-Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Municipal Government of Taizhou; and the Directors-General of the Foreign Affairs Offices of the Hanjing Municipal People's Government. And from the Russian Federation, the Director of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Comrade Maksim Musikhin, who has held exchanges with the Authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Nicaragua.</p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In addition, these Delegations of so many Brothers and Sisters whom we receive in Nicaragua with unequivocal Affection, these Delegations show how we strengthen the Bonds of Sincere Friendship, Respectful Cooperation, Love, as a Human Family. It is our Culture of Peace, Joy, Faith and Security that is expressed and manifested in the Affection with which we care for all these Brothers and Sisters from so many parts of the World.</p>
