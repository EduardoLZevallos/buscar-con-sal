            TcS : Vice Minister, what has been ALBA's impact on
            Nicaragua's trade from your point of view?<br>
            <br>
            Vice Ministra Ver&oacute;nica Rojas : Since the
            establishment of the Bolivarian Peoples' Alliance we've had
            two main impacts. The first impact in our external trade has
            to do with the democratization that has taken place in a
            real way for the economic actors in terms of their access to
            outside markets. For example, in Nicaragua's case we are the
            biggest agricultural producer in the region. We are the
            cattle country par excellence.<br>
            <br>
            So of all our production about 77% comes from the
            agricultural sector. And they are small economic units,
            small farms, often no more than 7 to 15 hectares. And they
            are dedicated to both arable farming and cattle rearing.<br>
            <br>
            One of the main products that has had what I'd call a large
            increase with the opening up of ALBA markets, especially
            Venezuela, has been the sale of live cattle. How has that
            helped us? It has helped us by creating an outlet that had
            previously been closed to exports of live cattle. <br>
            <br>
            We're talking about the five years after the year 2000 when
            there was a market in Mexico. And these were bullocks of up
            to 300 kilos in weight. Once that Mexican market closed for
            live cattle exports, what happened to our small and medium
            sized cattle producers? They were left holding cattle
            without an export outlet.<br>
            <br>
            So the farms were saturated with cattle. That had a serious
            effect, to the extent that indicators of extreme poverty
            affected small farms that should not have been in extreme
            poverty but were, despite having land to cultivate and
            livestock, and could well have been in a better situation.
            However, on having the external market closed, they were
            left unable to sell their product.<br>
            <br>
            The opening towards Venezuela has affected us because it
            allows an outlet for already existing cattle there in the
            productive units. The cattle farmer was losing money because
            he had the animals grazing for longer. They couldn't sell
            into the external market, nor could their cattle be absorbed
            internally.<br>
            <br>
            That's why I insist on the democratization of foreign trade.
            Because the fact that it is based on collection and
            consolidation of lots for export permits collection farm by
            farm, identifying those cattle that fill the requirements
            and that benefited a wide range of small farmers.<br>
            <br>
            And what did that positive impact allow? It has allowed two
            things. An improvement in living standards and greater
            integration into the country's domestic market of that part
            of the population. Because they have to buy things and, too,
            it has assured their ability to renew their stock. These
            things are positive in the short term. I sell two or three
            bullocks or heifers that satisfy the ALBA market
            requirements and that automatically benefits myself, my
            family and my network. I am able to improve their living
            conditions.<br>
            <br>
            But also I can expand with a programme of stock retention
            promoted individually by cattle farmers. They have renewed
            the process of keeping calves and fattening them to sell as
            bullocks and that permits a continuing improvement in stock
            and increases the efficiency of the cattle sector and of the
            country.<br>
            <br>
            Another important element. Since there is now a market open,
            as a producer I have to consider how to be more efficient
            and, in a short time frame, cut the time it takes to ensure
            the appropriate weight and size of the cattle I am going to
            sell. I introduce technology to do that and to that end the
            Ministry of Agriculture and the Institute for Rural
            Development, our government bodies, have accompanied
            producers to ensure they reach the required quality.<br>
            <br>
            So the effects run from ALBA to Nicaragua and from Nicaragua
            to the Central American region. Why to the Central American
            region? Because other governments have also signed
            agreements, even some that have free trade agreements not
            with ALBA but with other countries, but with results from
            the impact of the creation of ALBA.<br>
            <br>
            With the creation of ALBA a market has opened up for all of
            Central America that creates an opportunity for the rest of
            the Central American countries, given Nicaragua's example to
            trade in particular with Venezuela. Other countries that
            produce less than us, but which do produce cattle as well,
            have made both complete and partial free trade agreements
            with the ALBA countries.<br>
            <br>
            But that's not all. Because ALBA's existence gives us market
            security at a fair price and, above all, the fact that we
            don't face the prospect of political change in counterpart
            countries that might close down markets. In the case of the
            ALBA countries, we have the security of those markets
            staying open. That has given us the chance to think more
            effectively, not just about ALBA but about other markets
            too.<br>
            <br>
            It has allowed us to advance in updating the phytosanitary
            aspects of our production and updating our technology so as
            to be able to enter new markets. We should not view ALBA
            only as ALBA in Nicaragua or ALBA in Central America, but as
            Nicaragua within ALBA broadening and improving productive
            conditions&nbsp; for example with the countries of the
            Central American Free Trade Agreement, with Taiwan, with
            Japan, with other countries, with the European Union. <br>
            <br>
            For example we have now started procedures to ensure bovine
            traceability. About two and a half years ago it was
            something the markets were asking for and we knew we were
            running out of time to implement it, but we hadn't the
            conditions to be able to do so. The fact that there's a
            guaranteed market stimulates in the mentality of producers
            the need to change, along with a government like ours
            offering that change via different programmes, like those of
            bovine traceability and phytosanitary programmes that have
            helped us declare the country free of swine flu or avian flu
            and with a controlled risk of mad cow disease for example.<br>
            <br>
            This makes farmers more disposed to change, more disposed to
            take on their business responsibility to be more competitive
            and make their farm or their crops more competitive so as to
            make their sector of the economy and the country more
            competitive too.<br>
