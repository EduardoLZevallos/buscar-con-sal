Elders Council declares La

<big><small><small>On
April 18th the Elders Council of La Mosquitia (considered the maximum
authority of the indigenous Miskito
people's traditional organizational structure) held an assembly in
Bilwi (Puerto Cabezas) at
which they declared the independence of the Northern and Southern
Atlantic Regions (RAAN and RAAS) from Nicaragua. The new nation the
Elders intend to create will be called the Communitary Nation of La
Mosquitia.<br>
<br>
During the event at which the surprise announcement was made, Reverend
Hector
Williams was elected as Gran Wihta Tara, the maximum leader of La
Mosquitia and of the authority the Elders now recognize as the
legitimate government of the Caribbean region. <br>
<br>
Also during the assembly the Council of Elder Ministers assist
Williams' government, as was the Indigenous Army of La
Mosquitia, a force of approximately 200 former Yatama combatants which
was designated the task of defending the independence of La Mosquitia. </small></small></big><big>

<br>
[During
the 1980s, Yatama, then an indigenous resistance movement, was involved
in the armed conflict against the first FSLN government. In the 1990s
the
movement became a political party and has since participated in several
regional and&nbsp;national elections with relative success.
Currently
Yatama is part of the FSLN led governing political alliance. The
members
of the Indigenous Army of La Mosquitia, however, expressed their
profound discontent with the recent policies and actions of Yatama
leader Brooklyn Rivera.</span></small></small></span></big><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">]</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">

The
Declaration of Independence read during the assembly proposes a six
month transition period and issues a formal request for assistance from
the UN to carry
out this process. The declaration goes on to order the suspension of
all political elections&nbsp;and instructs companies operating
within
the region to
desist from their tax payments to Nicaragua's central government and to
come to agreements vis a vis tax and other arrangements with the newly
proposed authorities. <br>

century La Mosquitia (the territories belonging to the Miskito people
comprising part of the current northern Nicaraguan and southern
Honduran Caribbean regions) was an autonomous region where Miskitos
lived relatively peacefully with the English who had
colonized certain parts of the coastal region. <br>
<br>
In
1894 Nicaraguan President José Santos Zelaya invaded the part
of&nbsp;La Mosquitia that today forms Nicaragua's Caribbean coast
and
obliged a number of representatives of the Miskito people to sign a
convention agreeing to become part of Nicaragua. As journalist Sergio
Simpson describes </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">in <a href="http://sergiosimpson.ysublog.com/?p=345">a recent
article</a>
published on his blog, the Miskito people have, ever since, suffered
discrimination, violence, exploitation and disrespect at the hands of
their mestizo "co-patriots:" </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">[Mestizo is the term used to describe
persons of mixed Nicaraguan-Spanish ancestry]</span></small></small></span></big><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">

independentist proposal is not new ... it has existed ever since ...
1894 when President José Santos Zelaya militarily invaded [La
Mosquitia] refusing to acknowledge the local autonomous authorities.
Mestizo representatives
from the Pacific coast turned up, displaced creoles and indigenous
persons and imposed their own classist and, of course, racist
discriminatory visions. A concept of "civilization" was imposed which
established unsurmountable differences between costeños (indigenous
people and afrodecendents) and mestizos. </span></small></small></span></big><br style="font-style: italic;">

then all the different ... leaders of
Nicaragua have signed concessions permitting the exploitation of
[the Caribbean coast's] human and natural resources, although such
concessions have never permitted indigenous communities to enjoy the
benefits of their properties. ... The majority of the indigenous lands
were declared as Nicaraguan national territory.</span></small></small></span></big><span style="font-style: italic;"> ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">With
the triumph of the Popular Sandinista Revolution (1979) the
contradictions between the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and
central government were magnified to such an extent that indigenous
tribes
resorted to armed violence against the government as part of the
[Contra] war financed by the US. ... </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">The
Law of Autonomy of the Caribbean Coast (Law 28 approved in September
1987) was the product of negotiations between Miskito armed groups and
the Sandinista government which, after four years at war, yielded to
the pressure and understood the demands [being made by the Miskitos]. </span></small></small></span></big><br style="font-style: italic;">

(1990) ... the indigenous territories
have suffered the onslaught of individuals anxious to acumulate
immediate
wealth even if that implies the destruction of large areas of terrain.
We see National Army helicopters involved in the destruction of the
Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, local and Pacific leaders investing in
timber processing, cattle farming and industrial fishing,
thousands of people getting involved in the trafficking and consumption
of cocaine, thousands of former soldiers, mestizo contras and land
merchants invading the jungle. </span></small></small></span></big><br style="font-style: italic;">

Miskito people went straight from the suffering of armed
conflict to the distress of hunger, loss of communal values,
delinquential violence, the increasing deterioration of their natural
and environmental resources and the corruption of indigenous leaders.</span></small></small></span></big><br>

So far central and regional government representatives have said very
little in public about the implications of the Elder's announcement or
how they plan to react. Similarly national media
outlets&nbsp;(admittedly all based in Pacific urban centers) have
published little about events in the Caribbean regions. There is a
sense in which the generalized silence surrounding events suggests that
people are waiting anxiously to see </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">how serious the Elder's council is
about its proclamation, and </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">what is going to happen next.
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
According
to Wilfredo Jarquín Lang, Special Ombudsman for Indigenous People and
Ethnic Communities for the RAAS, the Miskito Elders Council's
separatist aspirations are not shared by the rest of the indigenous
peoples and other communities of the Caribbean region. This was
certainly the inexplicit intepretation the FSLN party political
periodical, El 19, made of the </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">Sumu Mayangna Nation </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">General
Assembly celebrated in the town of Rosita, RAAN, at the beginning of
May, during which new authorities were elected in the presence of
central and regional government representatives. <br>
<br>
Special
Ombudsman for Indigenous People and Ethnic Communities for the RAAN,
Violeta Irías Nelson, is of the opinion that, whether or not the
Miskito Elders Council is acting in representation of majority regional
opinion, the decision "not to recognize the established authorities,
and the formation of the Indigenous Army of La Mosquitia, could be bad
signs." <br>
<br>
Brooklyn Rivera, a National Assembly Deputy and leader
of the indigenous party Yatama (which, as mentioned above, is allied
with the FSLN), coincides with Irías' fear. "As long as whichever
government is in power fails to attend to the demands and aspirations
of [the people of the Caribbean regions] those demands will gain more
and more force," says Rivera. "As inhabitants of [the Caribbean
regions] we acknowledge that the [separatist movement] could gain broad
support from all sectors. ... Although the proclamation of independence
is juridically weak, the eventual cultural and political impact
could&nbsp;provoke large forces to rebel and create a serious
conflictive
situation."<br>
<br>
Secretary of Indigenous Affairs at the Nicaraguan
Foreign Ministry, Joel Dixon, minimized the Elders' Council annoucement
saying "it doesn't even have the full support of the Miskito people,
let alone the other peoples" (mayangna, garifuna, rama, creole and
mestizo). Dixon believes that beneath the announced aspiration of
independence lies another objective - to undermine the leadership of
Rivera within Yatama and among the region's population as a whole.<br>
<br>
No
explanation of any diplomatic or other response to the Elders Council's
announcement was given by Dixon, the only central government official
to have publicly commented on recent events. Undeniably, if the Miskito
communal authorities were to go ahead with their announced plan to
establish an independent nation, Nicaragua's central government would
be faced with a very difficult and potentially explosive situation. The
very existence of the Indigenous Army of La Mosquitia violates the
Nicaraguan constitution which states that the only armed forces legally
permitted to exist are the Nicaraguan Army and the National Police.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Possibile
manipulation of Miskitos by underground forces </span><br>
<br>
As
could be expected a number of conspiracy theories have been put forward
about who and what superior forces are behind the surprise
separatist&nbsp;announcement. In <a href="http://www.nicaraguahoy.info/dir_cgi/topics.cgi?op=view_topic;cat=Opinion;id=57004">an
article</a> which appeared on the right wing news and information
website,</span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;"> www.nicaraguahoy.info, </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;"> run from Costa Rica,</span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">
Roberto Escobedo Caicedo claims that agents of both the Colombian
government and Colombian drug cartels are involved in underground
campaigns to encourage&nbsp;separatist aspirations among Miskitos.
The
former, he says, are doing so with the intention of avoiding
Nicaragua's claim against Colombia over the </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">maritime border the </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">two
nation's share coming to fruition at the International Court of
Justice, while the latter are interested in creating the conditions to
install a cocaine trafficking haven. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">during comments to a national TV news
program, </span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">FSLN
Deputy Gustavo Porras expressed his suspicion that US Ambassador Robert
Callahan is the one behind the formation of the separatist Miskito
movement. Porras cited Callahan's experience as US Embassy spokesmen in
Honduras during the 1980s, during which time he assisted John
Negroponte in coordinating the Contra war against the FSLN government.
"And I understand that he [helped organize separatist movements] in
Yugoslavia,"&nbsp;</span></small></small></span></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small><span style="color: black;">Porras went on.<br>
<br>
Going
on publicly available information, it is as yet impossible to come to
any sort of conclusion about whether some underground force with
sinister intentions is behind the Elders Council's recent actions, or
what the possible outcome of the situation may be. One can but hope
that the Council is motivated by a genuine desire to help the Miskito
and other peoples of Nicaragua's Caribbean coastal regions overcome
their current situation of desperate impoverishment and
marginalization. It would be naïve, however, to overlook the
attractiveness the extreme social and political vulnerability of the
region (the poorest and least developed of Central America) would
represent, in terms of being a potential <span style="font-style: italic;">punto de entrada,</span>
for groups interested in destabilizing the country and its central
government.</span></small></small></span></big><br>
