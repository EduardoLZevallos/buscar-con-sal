      <br>
Many themes of global importance overlap when
discussing events in Central America. An apparently simple discussion
of local developments in the Nicaraguan economy ends up covering
global issues. One has to look at the role of the dollar, the price
of oil, the garbage-in-garbage-out twin moral failure of the US and
European corporate media and financial systems, or the symmetry
between increasing imperialist militarism and domestic economic
decline. <br>
      <br>
Comment on global issues generally fails to take adequately into
account
current local realities. Similarly, a great deal of regional analysis
understates the impact of broader global trends. Coverage - and the
lack of it - of the latest ALBA country summit involving countries
(1) with a
combined population of over 75 million - reflects this very
well.<br>
      <br>
Before pursuing that point, it is worth noting a
poignant contrast. Much has been made of the abolition, by President
Clinton in 1999, of the Glass-Steagall Act which separated investment
banking from commercial banking after the 1929 Wall Street crash. But
few have stepped back to note the even more profound policy
implications of the 2000 expiry of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act.
Economics writer Henry C.K.Liu has noted that the Humphrey-Hawkins
legislation in theory behoved the US government and Federal Reserve
to sustain full employment.(2)<br>
      <br>
Among other things it
â&#8364;&#339;explicitly states that the federal government will rely
primarily
on private enterprise to achieve the four goals of full employment,
growth, price stability, and balance of trade and budget. Liu's
persuasive gloss on that is, "Implicitly, private enterprise must
be regulated so that corporate profit is structurally aligned with
the achievement of the four policy goals. The private sector cannot
be allowed to prosper with counterproductive activities that negate
the four policy goals and treat social costs as externalities to
business. In welfare economics, an externality is a socio-economic
cost created by one actor, the payment for which is imposed on
others."<br>
      <br>
The expiry of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act was, in
effect, the last goodbye to a United States governed in any sense for
the benefit of the majority. It was President Clinton and the
Democrat wing of the US oligarchy who finally and categorically
handed over the United States economy to the country's corporate
plutocracy. A similar betrayal has been under way for a long time in
the European Union. That is why, now, the US government and its
European allies have acted so vigorously to save major banks from
bankruptcy while abandoning tens of millions of people to
unemployment and indigence.<br>
      <br>
Contrast that fact with the
fundamental policy statement of one of the ALBA country finance
Ministers, Alberto Guevara of Nicaragua. Guevara explains that the
economic vision of the FSLN government in Nicaragua is "not to act
in political economy as if we were crunching numbers, but rather to
turn political economy into a social policy with economic
implications, in such a way that when we take decisions of political
economy we do so....on the basis of the millions of Nicaraguans
behind the statistics, waiting at long last for the dream of the
revolution to crystallize, for the dream of every woman and man in
this country to crystallize, focused on making progress, on forging a
better destiny for their children, for their people, for their
barrio, their community, their municipality, for the whole country.
So then, we are working on a revolutionary project that has the human
person at the centre of the system, at the centre of the model."<br>
      <br>
In
Latin America, the ALBA countries are building an unprecedented
economic system with the human person at its centre, based on
solidarity, cooperation, redistribution and complementarity. By
contrast, the United States government and legislature have abandoned
all but the most vestigial remains of any humanist, humanitarian
vision of political economy. It is worth exploring this contrast more
deeply, because it also explains why US imperialist military
aggression is likely to plunge the region into war.<br>
      <br>
The
financial crisis <br>
      <br>
Interest rates in the US were kept
deliberately below the inflation rate through 2002 and 2003. "The
real funds rate, which is the nominal rate adjusted for inflation,
was negative for three years, from October 2002 to October 2005".(3)
That signalled a vast extended credit boom. As the shadow banking
system created by deregulation in the United States and Europe grew,
it assimilated informal versions of the traditional money creation
and control functions of Central Banks. Those same speculative
financial entities â&#8364;&#8220; most obviously, mega-banks and hedge funds
-
developed ways of exploiting volatility and manipulating marginal
differences
between global markets, eventually taking on the role of large-scale,
informal
money creators, perhaps most damagingly in the housing sector. <br>
      <br>
They
created enormous volumes of out-of-control debt in the shape of
convoluted notional securitized assets and swap quasi-insurance-bets
beyond the reach of Central Banks and other regulators. Governments
and Central Banks blatantly and grotesquely abrogated their
regulatory functions in the name of "free markets", despite
the accumulated wisdom of decades indicating that poorly regulated
markets are bound to fail. Asset price inflation and ballooning debt
were treated with unbelievable crassness by incestuous economic and
political authorities as if they equalled growth.<br>
      <br>
The
overseers of the Western Bloc financial system ignored the very
fiscal and monetary rectitude global enforcers like the IMF and the
World Bank impose so sanctimoniously on impoverished developing
countries. Now, a structural adjustment is being imposed by their
governments on the peoples of Western Bloc financial delinquents like
the United States, Britain, Spain and Ireland, to name the obvious
cases. At the same time, trillions of dollars - over US$13 trillion
in the US alone - have magically appeared with which to bail out
Western Bloc financial institutions. <br>
      <br>
Relatively trifling sums
available for social spending, for reducing poverty at home and for
development cooperation overseas, are cut. Conversely, the US
military budget increases each year by hundreds of billions of
dollars. Other NATO countries, Canada and the Europeans, continue to
fund billion-dollar military interventions in Afghanistan and
elsewhere.
Apparently, no other outcome is possible in the weird cynical fantasy
world of Western Bloc country governments, still imaginatively and
culturally hostage to the hypocrisy and sadism of their colonial
past, now being progressively and zealously applied to their own
peoples.<br>
      <br>
The dollar and accountancy rules<br>
      <br>
Forget the
fairy tale of the "free market". No such thing has ever existed,
nor ever will. Central banks and governments work intimately with
giant corporate finance entities to nudge markets along desired lines
- that is why, for example, major US financial entities like Goldman
Sachs, J.P.Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan
Stanley and insurance giant AIG have been underwritten through the
financial crisis, one way or another, by the US government. <br>
      <br>
Note that Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, J.P.Morgan, Morgan Stanley and
Bank of America are all Primary Government Securities Dealers - vital
Federal Reserve partners in managing global markets. (4) Right now
the dollar is being allowed to slide just as it was from 2007 into
2008. Once again commodity prices are rising sharply. Oil has risen
abruptly to over US$80. Gold is well over US$1000.<br>
      <br>
This is not
just because a weaker dollar helps close the US current account
deficit. That kind of old-economy-thinking expired along with the
Humphrey-Hawkins Act. Volatile dips, swings and lurches in commodity
and currency markets allow major rich-country corporate financial
entities to make billions of dollars in profits via bets using
hapless tax-payers' bail-out money. On top of that, the low Federal
Reserve funds rate means banksters are able to borrow at almost zero
interest.<br>
      <br>
No serious attempt has been made to reverse the abolition of
Glass-Steagall and fence off investment bank speculation on
international markets from domestic commercial bank lending. While
the US and British economies stagnate for lack of genuinely
productive stimulus, in the US the real-economy-free financial sector
rushes to remake itself, in part to head off the effects of stringent
postponed accounting rules that come into play from November
onwards.<br>
      <br>
Who cares about accounting rules? Well, you would, if
it meant you could value your assets on what your paid advisers
reckoned them to be rather than what you could currently get for them
in the market. All those corporate "free market"
enthusiasts leapt at the chance of abandoning so-called
"mark-to-market" rules early in 2009 because it allowed
them to apply more generous valuations to much-depreciated assets.
Thus they can borrow more than they would otherwise be able to by
re-leveraging their assets using those more generous values. Then
they take that money - effectively free, at less than 1% - and game
it in the stock market, in commodities markets, in currency markets. <br>
      <br>
They do all kinds of things with their profits except invest
them so as to generate employment and productive activity in the real
economy. They pay their already overpaid staff billions of dollars in
bonuses, they help the Federal Reserve monetize government debt by
buying government bonds paying 3% or 4% interest, they work with the
Federal Reserve to try out new exit strategies, experimenting in
controlling inflation through mechanisms like paying interest to them
on balances they hold with the Reserve, or via intricate, strategically
managed reverse-repurchase transactions, or via the purchase of Federal
Reserve long-term securities. (5) Or they just hoard the money ready
to face the effects of Financial Accounting Standards Board changes
to Rule 140 which obliges them to bring unloved off-balance sheet
Special Purpose Entities onto their balance sheets from November 15th
onwards.<br>
      <br>
Special Purpose Entities have long been used by
corrupt corporate financial entities - Enron is the most notorious
example - to keep worthless assets off their balance sheet. Doing so
inflates the value of the corporate entity. To get an idea of the
sums involved, in 2008 Citigroup held over US$800bn in Qualifying
Special Purpose Entities, JPMorgan Chase over $600 billion, Bank of
America over $80 billion and Wells Fargo almost US$40bn. Despite the
farcical government-supervised "stress tests", no one really
knows for sure the amounts by which such corporate financial entities
will have to write down their balance sheets once the rule change
takes effect. It will certainly affect their market valuations,
perhaps dramatically, and is another factor explaining why banks are
not lending enough into the productive economy. <br>
      <br>
History teaches only that we learn nothing from history <br>
      <br>
The end result of all the trillions of dollars created to bail out
the rich country financial sector is that neither governments, nor
the central banks nor the financial corporations have changed. The
United Kingdom remains in recession. The shock has at long last led
even one of those responsible for the capitalism's latest debacle,
Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to remark, "It is
important that banks in receipt of public support are not encouraged
to try to earn their way out of that support by resuming the very
activities that got them into trouble in the first place....The sheer
creative imagination of the financial sector to think up new ways of
taking risk will in the end, I believe, force us to confront the 'too
important to fail' question."(6) <br>
      <br>
King's ill-received
statement of the obvious comes two whole years after the failure of a
couple Bear Stearns controlled hedge funds in July 2007 that finally
triggered the onset of a systemic collapse long-foretold. His remarks
are a frank recognition of abysmal failure. But they are unlikely to
have much impact in a system where King's Deputy Governor, Charles
Bean can be reported as feeling optimistic about so called
"quantitative easing" - flooding banks with massive liquidity.
The same day King's remarks were reported, Bloomberg also reported
Bean as having said, on October 13th, that "rising asset prices
suggest" quantitive easing has had a "'significant' impact and
signaled optimism the economy had troughed."(7)<br>
      <br>
The stunning
foolishness of this is not just that two weeks later British
government figures announced the country was still in recession. The
frightening point of Bean's quoted remarks is that the economic
authorities of Europe and the United States very clearly still
believe rising asset values are equivalent to productive economic
growth, even while they glibly dismiss rising unemployment as "a
lagging indicator". In Europe, as in the US,&nbsp; political and
economic authorities imitate Dr. Frankenstein, trying to put back
together, as it was, the self-same rotten system that has just fallen
so spectacularly apart. <br>
      <br>
The meaning of the Bolivarian
Alliance for the Americas - ALBA <br>
      <br>
It is in that context that
the Seventh ALBA Summit took place in Cochabamba, Bolivia. (8) Report
and comment in both corporate media and in the neo-colonial
progressive media consistently ignore or downplay the significance of
ALBA. Or when they acknowledge its importance, they tend to disparage
its achievements, relevance and viability. While ALBA itself is
comprised of countries with a population of just over 75 million, the
countries in its sister regional agreement, Petrocaribe, have a total
population of over 90 million. If one adds up the total population of
countries participating in both Petrocaribe and ALBA, the total is
over 114 million.(9) <br>
      <br>
The fundamental reason for ALBA's
successful development so far is that relatively small countries can
only defend their interests if they unite. That is true in every
sense. It may well be the case that the power and influence of Europe
and the United States is in irreversible decline. But new
quasi-imperialist menaces loom, from China and more immediately, from
Brazil. <br>
      <br>
Countries like Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador look at
the experience of the Mercosur trading bloc (Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay) and see that its development has been hampered
by the domination of Brazilian big business. They have their own
experiences of ruthless Brazilian corporate and government policies.
They can also see that China is vacuuming up natural resources as
voraciously as ever the old imperialist powers ever did. Only united
will the ALBA countries be able to defend effectively their natural
resources and their peoples.<br>
      <br>
One important aspect of the
Cochabamba summit is that it may finally dampen futile attempts by
smaller countries to prioritize working together with Brazil on
continental integration. Very clearly the ALBA countries will
prioritize their own institutions in preference to seeking links with
a sclerotic Mercosur and a nascent Bank of the South, both dominated
by the neo-liberal sympathies of Brazil's ruling elite. Former
Bolivian hydrocarbons minister, Andres Solis Rada has noted, "Brazil,
by becoming an IMF creditor and increasing its voting share in the
World Bank has become an associate of the oppressive nations
strangling the nations they oppress."(10)<br>
      <br>
ALBA's integration
strategy works on two tracks, the extraordinary wide-ranging
policy commitments of ALBA itself and the less comprehensive energy
and food security focus of Petrocaribe. The principal benefits of
Petrocaribe for its member countries are improved cash-flow though
access to oil supplies on preferential terms (half paid within 90
days and the balance at nominal interest over 20 years), increased
investment in energy infrastructure - including renewable energy -
and food security support. <br>
      <br>
Member countries of ALBA have
access to a very much wider range of economic, social and cultural
policy options. Alberto Guevara believes, "ALBA is the alternative
model we are developing in Latin America and the Caribbean so that we
integrate the family of peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean on
the basis of different associative principles. I am talking about
principles that have nothing to do with current principles in the
context of the international financial community, that work unfairly
in many cases - donations and so on. <br>
      <br>
In ALBA conditionalities
affecting countries' sovereignty do not exist. There are none. In
ALBA the principle of self-determination is paramount. But we also
have in ALBA principles like that of solidarity, real solidarity
which is a disinterested solidarity aimed as helping those who have
the least, so that they can reach a level of development as a
country, as a nation as a people.<br>
      <br>
In ALBA you find the
principle of complementarity. A principle that exists nowhere else in
the world outside ALBA. It is a principle which in the first place
recognizes the different relative development the peoples of our
America have lived, in part thanks to those who colonized these
peoples, who destroyed and stole our raw materials and murdered our
indigenous peoples so as to build up the original capital
accumulation that later formed world capitalism. That principle of
complementarity is a new principle. It is a principle of justice. It
is a principle of brotherhood."(11)
      <p>ALBA's example in Nicaragua</p>
      <p>Guevara's lyrical account of ALBA is borne out by Nicaragua's
practical experience of ALBA's benefits which are profuse. In terms
of trade, Nicaragua's exports to Venezuela increased from around US$8
million in 2007, the year Nicaragua joined ALBA, to over US$90
million currently in 2009. The increase is almost entirely in
agricultural produce like beans, beef and dairy products. Nicaragua's
agricultural economy has turned around dramatically as a result of
government led investment, largely funded by ALBA. The principle of
complementarity means that Venezuela will accept payment in kind -
in agricultural produce - equivalent to the cash price of its
oil.<br>
      <br>
The investment necessary to develop Nicaragua's
agriculture in that way came both from the funds released by the
concessionary terms of Petrocaribe oil purchases and from
low-interest loans provided by Venezuela's development bank. That
transformation led to record exports in 2008, with a fall in 2009
projected at less than 5%. It has also meant that record production
in the first semester has helped the government and producers cope
much better than they might otherwise have done with the dramatic
adverse effects of this year's drought provoked by the climatic
phenomenon, El NiÃ±o.<br>
      <br>
In terms of energy, the
Nicaraguan-Venezuelan joint venture company Albanisa will be
importing and storing all of Nicaragua's oil requirement by the end
of 2010. So Nicaragua will be independent of the giant transnational
oil major Exxon which has always managed Nicaragua's oil imports
until now. In just two years, ALBA has provided an additional 290
megawatts to Nicaragua's electrical generating capacity, liberating
Nicaragua's consumers from the spectre of the regular extended power
cuts, month after month in 2006, resulting from&nbsp; the energy
policies of 16 years of Washington Consensus imposed privatization
and deregulation. Nicaragua's daily electricity consumption is a
little over 500 megawatts.<br>
      <br>
The concessionary terms of
Nicaragua's oil purchases from Venezuela have made possible subsidies
to Nicaragua's transport system that has protected public transport
consumers and operators from the disruptive inflationary effects of
oil price volatility. In Managua, Nicaragua's capital, public
transport users, the vast majority on very low incomes, pay half what
they might otherwise pay. Interurban
bus prices have also been held stable ever since the oil price shock of
2008. A key feature of ALBA's program is the establishment of joint
venture companies involving partnerships between the bloc's member
states. This is ALBA's response to the depredations of rich country
multinational corporations.<br>
      <br>
Infrastructure investment derived
from ALBA includes a refinery and petrochemical complex scheduled for
construction on Nicaragua's Pacific Coast on which preparatory work
has already begun.&nbsp; On the northern Atlantic Coast,
reconstruction following Hurricane Felix continues, including
improvements to the port at Bilwi (Puerto Cabezas) and work advancing
on the long-neglected main road linking Puerto Cabezas to the
country's Pacific Coast via Matagalpa. Five agro-industrial projects
are planned for 2010 onwards. ALBA also funds nationwide housing and
street-paving programmes.<br>
      <br>
The other main programmes made
possible by ALBA in Nicaragua include medical facilities like the eye
hospital in Ciudad Sandino which has attended tens of thousands of
low income patients since it opened in 2007. ALBA funds Cuban medical
brigades that cover the areas of the country least well served by
Nicaragua's medical system, especially the Atlantic Coast. Cultural
and sports programmes have created opportunities for thousands of
young Nicaraguans to pursue otherwise inaccessible courses of
training and study. ALBA's greatest achievement in the field of
education has been the elimination of illiteracy in Nicaragua and
Bolivia.<br>
      <br>
ALBA in the region<br>
      <br>
ALBA does all this just in Nicaragua. It has similar programmes
and projects in train or planned in all its nine member countries,
apart from the less diverse investments under the Petrocaribe
framework in almost 20 countries. All of this is intended not to
replace but rather to complement existing aid and cooperation
programmes from Western Bloc countries. What it also does, though, is
permit countries like Nicaragua to resist blatant aid and trade
blackmail, as was clearly the case when the United States government
cancelled Millenium Challenge Account funding earlier this year,
under the false pretext of allegations of electoral fraud. The bulk
of the amount concerned was replaced with funding from ALBA.<br>
      <br>
ALBA
and Petrocaribe provide unprecedented stability to their member
countries. But the United States, Canada and Europe persistently
accuse Venezuela of destabilizing the region. Self-evidently, what
they mean is that Venezuela destabilizes Western Bloc domination of
the region, traditionally sustained by the neo-colonial mechanisms of
aid, debt and unfair trade. An example of the challenge to
traditional neo-colonial relationships is that the ALBA countries
already have their own ALBA Bank. <br>
      <br>
At the Cochabamba summit
this month, they took a crucial step towards greater coherency as an
integrated regional economic community. That step was to set up a
common unit of account for intra-regional trade - the Unitary System
of Regional Compensation Payments (SUCRE). The SUCRE, which comes
into effect in January 2010 is the first step towards a common
currency. It means ALBA's member countries - with a total
population of over 75 million - will not need to purchase dollars in
order to pay for imports - for example Venezuelan oil - from fellow
member countries. This is another small but damaging blow to the US
dollar's status as the global reserve currency.<br>
      <br>
Henry C.K.Liu
again, "post-Cold War global trade morphed into a new form of
economic imperialism through which the strong advanced economies
exploit the weak underdeveloped economies. This is accomplished by
denying sovereign governments their right to deploy sovereign credit
for national development and forced them to depend on foreign capital
denominated in the fiat currency of the monetary hegemon." <br>
      <br>
ALBA's
challenge to the imperialist status quo</p>
      <p>On October 17th 2009, in Cochabamba, the ALBA countries served
notice that they intend to reclaim their sovereign right to deploy
their own sovereign credit for national and regional development. But
that is just one more reason for Western Bloc governments and
corporate media to deploy a daily campaign of diplomatic and
propaganda aggression against the ALBA countries, as they have done
for years now. Three other fundamental reasons underlie the
thoroughgoing cynicism and deceit of the United States government and
its allies.<br>
      <br>
The first of those reasons can be seen even from
the extremely bald account given here of ALBA's impact on national
and regional development. In that sphere, ALBA makes Western Bloc
aid, trade and debt skulduggery look like what it is â&#8364;&#8220; a
machinery
of control and domination shamelessly designed to hold back the
genuine sovereign development of peoples. ALBA offers an unanswerable
challenge to the Western Bloc aid-debt-and-unfair-trade development
model. <br>
      <br>
The issue of literacy is a damning instance of that
challenge. ALBA programmes eliminated illiteracy in Nicaragua and
Bolivia in just three years. Western Bloc development cooperation
programmes have failed to match that achievement in countries like
Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador in decades.&nbsp; If one asks why
that should be, the answer, clearly, is that they and their local
allies, have no interest in doing so. The contrast reveals the United
States and its allied countries' statements about their commitment to
reducing poverty to be vapid rhetoric.<br>
      <br>
The second of the three
reasons for Western Bloc aggression against the ALBA countries is
that the ALBA countries punch well above their weight in foreign
affairs. ALBA has stepped up promoting South-South cooperation in
their relations not just with China and India but with countries
like, for example, Algeria, Vietnam, Libya and Iran. Ecuador and
Venezuela are both members of OPEC.&nbsp; ALBA's example&nbsp; is
likely to be an important theme at the important South-South
Cooperation Conference scheduled for early December this year in
Kenya.<br>
      <br>
The other ALBA countries are likely to follow
Nicaragua's lead and support Russia by recognizing Abkhazia and South
Ossetia, the two states that achieved independence from Georgia in
2008. Russia participates in ALBA meetings with observer status. On
issues from Sri Lanka to Western Sahara to Palestine, ALBA countries
follow their own non-aligned anti-imperialist agenda - an example
Western Bloc countries are anxious to squash.<br>
      <br>
A third reason
Western Bloc countries loath ALBA's regional initiative is that the
ALBA countries are genuinely committed to diminishing the effects of
narcotics trafficking on their countries and have been very effective
in doing so. This is unsettling for the United States government, in
particular, whose international corporate finance sector partners -
all those Primary Government Securities Dealers&nbsp; - depend
heavily for their liquidity on the many trillions of dollars flushed
year-round through secretive off-shore financial centres. Via these
centres, hundreds of billions of dollars derived from the
international narcotics business and other organized crime are
laundered into the international finance system.<br>
      <br>
The
militarist threat<br>
      <br>
After over US$6bn of US taxpayers' money has been invested in the
bogus "war on drugs" in Colombia, cocaine exports from Colombia
are as healthy as ever. Despite both the "war on drugs" and the "war on
terror", heroin exports from Afghanistan are at record
levels. Now, with Plan Merida, the United States is boosting its
military and security industries with supplies to Mexico - just as
it has done in Colombia, Afghanistan and Iraq â&#8364;&#8220; by means of yet
another fake "war on drugs" initiative. Obviously, narcotics is
one of the United States' most important industries, meeting
insatiable consumer demand as well as providing vital economic
benefits to both the United States financial services industry and
its military and security based industries.<br>
      <br>
Asked in the
interview quoted earlier if he thought US military expansionism was
the inevitable corollary of domestic economic decline, Nicaragua
Treasury Minister Alberto Guevara remarked, "History has shown us
that always when there is a domestic crisis, the way out of it has
been to reactivate the military-industrial complex. In all recent
history, the war in Korea, the war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, all of
them. Furthermore, the natural concept of war is that the final
result has always been a sharing out of the world, so, in that sense,
war may be the expression of economics at its maximum
intensity."<br>
      <br>
The US government has tacitly supported the
military coup in Honduras in part because ousted President Manuel
Zelaya passionately supported ALBA. The US State Department used
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias as a proxy to facilitate a
framework agreement permitting occasional bouts of spurious "dialogue"
until the elections scheduled in Honduras for the end
of November. Even so, violent conflict there seems inevitable. In
Mexico, increased United States military support for the "war on
drugs" charade threatens to deepen the already critical social and
economic crisis under usurper President Felipe Calderon.<br>
      <br>
In
Colombia, Nobel Peace Prize winner President Barack Obama is
destabilizing the region by agreeing to establish five new US
military bases in the country. Even Brazil, whose troops lead the
military occupation of Haiti under UN auspices, has expressed
disquiet. President Obama's government has also agreed to install two
new US military bases in Panama. His administration has also
reactivated an important regional US radar and telecommunications
listening facility in Costa Rica. <br>
      <br>
The US economy is a wreck,
with unemployment unlikely to return even to pre-crisis levels for
another seven or eight years. By way of response, President Obama,
his corporate plutocrat backers and their Western Bloc allies, are
clearly engaged in a double-or-quits policy of imperialist military
expansionism. They are determined to use full-spectrum aggression
against the ALBA countries. They think militarist intimidation and
terror is the Western Bloc's best chance of, as Liu puts it, forcing
the region "to depend on foreign capital denominated in the fiat
currency of the monetary hegemon."<br>
