<p>Beloved children, grandchildren and granddaughters, great-grandchildren and great-granddaughters of Blanca Segovia... Blanquita! I still hear her voice, still 4 days ago, when she was just admitted to the hospital, we listened to her, we talked to her and, despite her situation which was really delicate, serious, her voice did not hesitate, and always with that energy of hers.<br />
<br />
Every time I met Blanquita, every time I talked to her personally, or we talked on the phone, I told her that listening to her was to be filled with energy, the energy of our General Sandino, and of Blanca Aráuz, of her mother.<br />
<br />
A woman with divine strength, the strength that comes giving Human Beings the capabilities, as our General Sandino said, to go Always Further On... Despite obstacles, despite challenges, Always Further On! That was, and is, Blanca Segovia, because despite her physical disappearance she is still present and accompanies us, accompanies her Family, accompanies the Nicaraguan People and accompanies us saying: Always Further On!<br />
<br />
Today is December 26th... On December 26, 1932, during his lifetime, our General Sandino had already managed to defeat the invading Yankees, and on a day like today, in the United States, from Washington, seat of the Government of the Yankee Empire, they announced that the last Yankee marine in Nicaragua, there were still Yankee marines here then, would leave Nicaragua on January 2, 1933; that is, just a few days afterwards came  the departure of the last sailor, which reflects the Victory of the Army In Defense of National Sovereignty, created and led by General Sandino. our General Sandino.<br />
<br />
And the enemy remains the same, although so many years have passed, back then they conspired and assassinated General Sandino, but there still remained the Force, the Strength of the Heroes who throughout History, from Diriangén to José Dolores Estrada and Andrés Castro, to Zeledón and our General Sandino, injected a Strength into the Nicaraguan People, which has made the Nicaraguan People unbeatable, defeating, overcoming, one after another, Yankee aggressions.<br />
<br />
And on this day when we are on the eve of Blanquita returning to San Rafael, there in Jinotega, to accompany her mother, Blanca Arauz, they will be in the center of San Rafael, in the center of the town, where the Museum is, the Museum and Cultural Center, the historic Center, and there the two of them will be, side by side, in the courtyard of the Center.<br />
<br />
And, from that Sacred Place they will continue to inspire the struggle of our People, giving strength and energy to our People, and giving Nicaraguans the right to defend Peace, Stability and Security, which is the greatest Good that a People can defend.<br />
<br />
Beloved Nicaraguan Brothers and sisters, on behalf of all of you, on behalf of the People of Nicaragua, we say to Augusto, to Julio, to Walter, we say to Blanquita's granddaughters, to Blanquita's grandchildren, to the great-grandchildren, we tell you that the entire People of Nicaragua, accompanies you, it does accompany you. And that, as Walter said well,  after all, Blanca's heart stopped beating, and these are inevitable moments in what Life is... Life, we already know, is nothing more than a transition, from the moment we are born it is well known that we will reach a moment when we move to another Plane of Life, which we may call Death, but it is nothing more than a transition. And just as the blood of our Heroes and Martyrs runs in the veins of our People, so will the blood of Blanca Segovia Sandino continue to flow as well.<br />
<br />
Blanca Segovia Sandino, Always Present, always accompanying our General in these battles that the Nicaraguan People will continue to fight, for Peace, for Freedom, for Justice. And we say to Blanquita: Where is Blanquita? Where's Blanquita? She is here! She is here in our hearts, the hearts of all Nicaraguans, of the entire People, she is present here, accompanying us! Blanquita, Blanquita, with your father we repeat the freedom loving slogan: A Free Nation or Death!<br />

<p><b>Remarks by Rosario, Vice-President of Nicaragua, after the Posthumous Tribute to Blanquita Sandino Aráuz</b><br />
<b>daughter of the General of Free Women and Men Augusto C. Sandino and Blanca Aráuz</b><br />
<br />
<b>December 26th 2022</b></p>

<p>I was noting to the compañeras and compañeros that there is a kind of deep silence. A silence implying respect. A silence full of presence. A silence that is mystery and Glory. A silence that is not really silence, but in fact is music from Heaven. We must always seek to know how to find and decipher the messages of silence.<br />
<br />
There has been much spoken about what Blanca leaves us as a Legacy, apart from that Sacred Blood of our General and of Blanquita, Blanca Stella, which she knew how to uplift every day, because she carried it in her body and carried it in her Soul, and taught us and told us, Always Further On. There is no other way!<br />
<br />
But also, I want to relate an anecdote that for me is revealing of her Strength, her Strength of Spirit. A few days after that fateful February 26th in 1990, Blanquita came to our house with Walter and his children, to tell us that more than ever she was with us, that more than ever she was part of us, both as Family and as the Sandinista Front.<br />
<br />
And those are the gestures one can never forget, because they reflect the character of a Person, in this case of a Heroic Woman; they are gestures that teach us, that show us, that inform us and that we must learn to imitate, precisely because they are of Courage, of Bravery, of being always willing to strive in all moments, in difficult, challenging, daunting moments, and in moments of joy, I can never forget that because it shows us what she was like: entire, integral, brave, always willing to go further on.<br />
<br />
I admire her, I love her, and we have the challenge of imitating that Strength every day, and we also have the blessing of being Believers, asking God every day to permit her to give us the Strength and Courage to keep fighting and keep overcoming, and keep calling us to promote the Unity of All for the Good of All! Thank you, Compañeras and Compañeros.<br />
