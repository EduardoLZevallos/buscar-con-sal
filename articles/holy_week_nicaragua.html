On April 5th (Palm Sunday) Nicaragua's centrist corporate daily, <em>El
Nuevo Diario</em>, published what has since become an infamous and
highly controversial <a
 href="http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2009/04/05/politica/99049"
 target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">interview with Abelardo
Mata</span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, Bishop of Estel&iacute;
and Vice President of the Nicaraguan Catholic Bishops Conference. The
front-page headline read <em>"Mata fears civil war."</em>
The contents of the interview are based on the Bishop's inflammatory
claim that there are armed groups in the mountains of the northern
departments of Nueva Segovia and Madriz who are preparing themselves to
engage in armed violence against the government in response to what he
describes as President Daniel Ortega's authoritarian actions.</span></span></p>

certain of the existence of armed groups in San Juan de
R&iacute;o
Coco," said Mata, "it is sad that in order to defend our rights we have
to look to arms. ... What triggered these groups to take to arms was
the [supposedly fraudulent] Municipal Elections, that is what people
say in the countryside. Now we have to wait for the campesinos to start
shooting each other, they are always the first ones to give their
blood, and then the Army will start shooting people in an attempt to
solve the problem.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; It hurts me to see this
coming." </span>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In
El Nuevo Diario's April 6th
edition these claims were backed up by Archbishop of Managua and
President of the Nicaraguan Bishops Conference, Monsignor Leopoldo
Brenes, who went on to allege that the Church has knowledge of the
existence of anti government armed groups in the mountains of two other
northern departments (Matagalpa and Jinotega).<br>
      <br>
Despite the
fact that the Catholic Church hierarchy's claims have been
categorically denied by both First Commissioner of the National Police,
Aminta Granera, and Head of the Nicaraguan Army, Omar Halleslevens, the
corporate media outlets, which are passionately opposed to the FSLN
government, have made it their business to pimp the "story" and
surrounding controversy for all it is worth. Something which has not
proved difficult given the course of events that followed. <br>

      </table>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">At
around 7.45 am on April 6th (Holy Monday) two armed individuals riding
a motorbike attacked the Attorney General of the Republic, Hernan
Estrada, while he was out on his routine morning run near his home in
Managua as part of an apparent assassination attempt. According to
statements given by Estrada at </span><a
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"
 href="http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2009/04/06/sufre-atentado-el-procurador-general-de-nicaragua-resulta-herido"
 target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a press conference</span></a><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;"> later
the same day one of the individuals took four shots at him "all aimed
at my head," of which only one penetrated his body causing a flesh
wound in his neck. As a result of the impact Estrada fell to the ground
bleeding, at which point "the criminals assumed they had achieved their
objective" and drove off. The police are carrying out a criminal
investigation into the incident of which few details have yet been made
public.<br>
      <br>
At the same press conference, during which Estrada was visibly shaken
up, he said the attack was the result of the <em>"calls made by
certain religious leaders and media outlets who are </em><em>apologists
of violence. They </em><em>have
been encouraging people to carry out criminal acts such as this one."<br>
      </em><br>
Immediately Estrada's comments were taken up and interpreted by the
opposition media as a direct accusation against the Catholic Church
hierarchy of involvement in the planning of the assassination attempt.
Journalists rushed to request statements from Bishops Brenes and Mata
in response to Estrada's "accusation." Among the headlines derived from
this second round of interviews were; "</span><a
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"
 href="http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2009/abril/10/noticias/ultimahora/321402.shtml"
 target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the Church is the first
to want peace</span></a><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">," (the same
phrase famously used by Pope John Paul II on his visit to Nicaragua in
1983); and, the Attorney General is "</span><a
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"
 href="http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/44921" target="_blank"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">rude and irrational</span></a><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">" ... "but [his]
comments do not worry us
because, thank god, the population knows who [to believe]." <br>
      <br>
During an appearance on Channel 4's morning TV show "Live with Alberto
Mora" on April 15th Roberto Larios, President of the Nicaraguan Union
of Journalists, described the corporate media's treatment of the series
of events as a farrago:<em> </em>"They
take a rumour about a non existent issue and, baselessly, project it
in the media [in order to] generate a distorted opinion surrounding the
supposed course of events." According to Larios in doing so the
corporate media are <em>"rehearsing an old technique they used in the
1980s as part of their campaign against the Popular Sandinista
Revolution."</em></span>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif;" dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">The continuation of the
media's manipulation of this particular series of events was greatly
facilitated on April 9th when a civil society group called Movement for
Nicaragua (founded and funded by the US Embassy and USAID) issued </span><a
 href="http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2009/abril/09/noticias/nacionales/321326.shtml"
 target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a statement</span></a><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;"> condemning
Estrada's comments about the Bishops. These comments, reads the
statement, "aim to keep the Bishops quiet, when [the Bishops] are the
very ones who transmit the sentiments of the population." <br>
      <br>
The statement then goes on to imply that the assassination attempt
against Attorney General Estrada was actually a set up devised by
Estrada and his government colleagues as part of a plan to justify
future "arbitrary actions." Ortega and his colleagues "are experts in
the production of counter propaganda," reads the statement, "in the
past they have invented martyrs, assaults and physical attacks in an
attempt to counteract adverse situations and justify whatever arbitrary
actions they decide to take. So [the attack on Estrada] would be no
exception." <br>
      <br>
As can be expected this insinuation was taken up and embellished by
different anti FSLN commentators and political figures permitting a
situation whereby both daily newspapers along with other anti FSLN
media outlets felt able to come to the conclusion earlier this week
that, not only is the presence of politically motivated armed groups in
the northern mountains of the country almost certainly a reality
(despite such a notion being denied by the highest representatives of
the public security forces), it is practically beyond reasonable doubt
to assume that the Attorney General shot himself in the neck in an
attempt to justify future arbitrary government actions of an unknown
but sinister nature. <br>
      <br>
This onslaught of misinformation makes it hard for one to focus on the
implications both the Mata interview and the Estrada assassination
attempt have for the country in terms of the strategies being put into
practise as part of the ongoing destabilization campaign. There is a
sense in which one is obliged to acknowledge and attempt to counteract
the slanderous claims made by representatives of the forces working to
undermine the government. More often than not one's intellectual energy
is exhausted in the process. An analysis of the implications of the
Holy Week events in Nicaragua is necessary, however, in order to permit
rational anticipation of future opposition strategies.<br>
      <br>
As independent Italian journalist Giorgio Trucchi states in a </span><a
 href="http://nicaraguaymasespanol.blogspot.com/2009/04/intentan-asesinar-procurador-general.html"
 target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">short article</span></a><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;about
the two incidents, the Bishops' claims of the presence of politically
motivated armed groups should be understood as forming part </span><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>"of
a destabilization plan orchestrated by an opposition that until now,
has not shown itself capable of presenting an alternative political or
economic plan (let alone a national plan) to the one the Ortega
government has been implementing for the last two years."<br>
      </em><br>
In Nicaragua, as in other Latin American countries like Venezuela and
Ecuador, when the political opposition fails to undermine the
government via conventional political processes (debate and campaigning
for example), the corporate media, a number of influential "civil
society" organizations, the Catholic Church and underground<span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;"> grupos de choque</span>
step in to do the job for them via dishonest and often illegal
processes (misinformation, provocation and violence).<br>

      <p style="font-family: sans-serif;" dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">It is not possible to
define to what extent the details like timing of and reactions to
provocative events as part of this campaign is coordinated between the
different participants. It would be na&iuml;ve, though, not to suspect
US
ambassador Robert Callahan's involvement in whatever coordination does
take place. [Callahan worked for many years as John Negroponte's
sidekick; as a spokesman for Ambassador Negroponte in Tegucigalpa (from
where the Contra War was coordinated) and more recently in Baghdad.] <br>
      <br>
Since Callahan began his diplomatic mission in Nicaragua in 2007 the
general tone of the opposition forces' anti government rhetoric has
risen to unacceptably provocative levels. Meanwhile a number of
atypical violent political attacks have taken place the most disturbing
of which was the attack on Radio Ya (pro FSLN) journalist
Nicol&aacute;s
Berr&iacute;os Santana. Berr&iacute;os was attacked by a group of
around eight people
travelling in two pick up trucks. Berr&iacute;os received multiple stab
wounds
before his attackers set fire to his vehicle and attempted to through
him inside it. His attackers were forced to flee, however, due to the
passing of another vehicle. <br>
      <br>
Understood within this context the attack on Attorney General Estrada
is the logical continuation of a worrying trend of politically
motivated violent attacks against individuals. Director of Radio La
Primerisima, an independent left wing radio station, William Grigsby
considers the attempted assassination a "very grave case. ... It is the
first attack [against a government representative] in Nicaragua for
many years."<br>
      <br>
As for the inflammatory statements made by Bishops Mata and Brenes,
Grigsby condemns what he believes to be a call for violence but is not
of the opinion that the premonitions the Bishops appear to be making
are relevant to the current socio political situation in Nicaragua.
"These diatribes being lanced from the pulpit provoke a tense
environment in the country that has no reason to exist. It would appear
the Bishops are keen for things to heat up, even for armed violence to
take place. ... Of course it is dangerous to propitiate violence, but
[armed conflict] is not what the people want, nor would the political
situation allow ... for such a thing to take place."<br>

      <p style="font-family: sans-serif;" dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt;">Almost as a afterthought it
would seem relevant to the context of recent events to mention the
ongoing split in the Catholic Church hierarchy. While Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo (one of the most fervent critics of the first
FSLN government) openly supports the Ortega Administration and even
presides the government Commission of Reconciliation, Verification,
Peace and Justice, the most influential members of the Nicaraguan
Bishops Conference, as demonstrated in this article, are fiercely
opposed to the FSLN. <br>
      <br>
It may well be the case that this
apparent ideological division of the hierarchs is representative of the
dilemma in which the Nicaraguan Church finds itself faced with steadily
diminishing congregations and the ongoing rise of different evangelical
churches and other more populist forms of religion. <br>
      <br>
It would not be unreasonable to assume that there are a number of
wealthy conservative parishioners (whose generous donations help fund
the different dioceses' activities and the comfortable lifestyles of
church representatives) putting pressure on the Bishops Conference to
use their influence to undermine the government. Perhaps Bishops Mata
and Brenes' anti government stance is partly motivated by the need to
protect the various short term interests at stake. It is worth
mentioning at this point that among the list of recipients of USAID
funding in Nicaragua features the Nicaraguan Association for Human
Rights (ANPDH), an organization presided by Bishop Mata. </span></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: sans-serif;">Cardinal Obando y
Bravo's
strategy may be the product of a longer term vision based on the
concern of whether or not the Catholic Church in Nicaragua will survive
at all in its current form. Catholicism's decline in Nicaragua was
undeniably hastened along during the previous neo liberal governments
as a result of the plummeting living standards and cultural
denaturalization provoked by those governments' economic and social
policies. Perhaps Obando's break with the Nicaraguan right is part of
an attempt to slow that ongoing decline. </span><a
