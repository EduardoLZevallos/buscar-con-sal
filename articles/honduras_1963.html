The democratization of Honduran society - any society - requires a
significant redistribution of&nbsp; wealth. Recognizing that,
Manuel Zelaya tried implementing a programme of government to deliver
the benefits of the nation's resources to the impoverished majority.
Over 50% of Hondurans live in poverty. Zelaya's attempt at some
moderate level of social justice brought a vicious response from the
country's entrenched plutocrat elite. In Latin America, this is an
ancient political motif.<br>
<br>
Some history<br>
<br>
The pattern of reform and reaction in the region became fixed in the
decades before the Second World War. In Central America, Honduras, El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala were all ruled by brutal
dictatorships through the 1930s until the mid and late 1940s. One
reading of the murder of the reformist Liberal politician Jorge Eliécer
Gaitan in 1948 in Colombia is that it defined the permanent rejection
of reform by regional oligarchies allied to powerful foreign corporate
interests, especially those of the United States. <br>
<br>
But it took some years for that rejection to consolidate itself fully
in Central America. The overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz in 1954 was preceded
by the great popular strike in Honduras of the same year. Moderate
reformist programmes by governments like those of Arbenz in Guatemala
and of Ramon Villeda Morales in Honduras were paralleled in El Salvador
under the Partido Revolucionario de Unificación Democrática lead by
army lieutenant-colonels Oscar Osorio and José María Lemus. <br>
<br>
It was the violent United States government reaction to the Cuban
revolution, especially after the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, which
ended prospects of broad democratic reform in the region. 1963 saw two
clear embodiments of this reality. First, in September of that year in
the Dominican Republic, reformist President Juan Bosch was overthrown
in a military coup effectively supported by the United States. Then
just a few days later, in Honduras, Colonel Lopez Arellano overthrew
the Liberal Party government of Ramon Villeda Morales. <br>
<br>
Lopez Arellano's coup was staged ten days before general elections in
which the progressive Liberal Party candidate Modesto Rodas Alvarado
was the overwhelming favourite to win the Presidency. US policy in
regard to such coups has hardly changed at all in fifty years. Kirk
Bowman writes of the coup by Lopez Arellano :<br>
<br>
"When López went ahead with the coup, his conservative allies scoffed
at the threatened suspension of U.S. aid and a break in diplomatic
relations: The U.S. 'would be back in six months'. The U.S. threat was
hollow. Numerous democratic presidents were ousted in 1962 and 1963 and
all of them were friends of Villeda. Coups in El Salvador, Guatemala,
Peru, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador were followed
closely in the press and the conservative opposition in Honduras could
track the pattern: The U.S. in every case suspended relations, publicly
exclaimed support of democracy, and then quickly renewed relations with
the generals. The pattern would be no different in Honduras. "(1)<br>
<br>
Little has changed. US policy remains almost exactly the same now as it
was in 1963. The European Union and its member governments will
eventually follow the lead of President Obama. Some formula in the name
of stability - for rich country corporations and banks, not for
ordinary people in Honduras - will be agreed. Foreign governments will
probably make every effort to legitimize the practical anti-democratic
effects of the coup so as to protect their corporate sectors'
investments.<br>
<br>
Specific local context in Honduras<br>
<br>
Honduran indigenous peoples' leader Salvador Zuniga remarked in a
recent interview that the coup against Manuel Zelaya meant a regression
of 30 years in Honduran politics. He might well have said over 45
years, because Manuel Zelaya very much represents a return to the
original sense of the <i>rodista</i> current of the Honduran Liberal Party.
That is why descriptions of Zelaya as a "leftist" are ridiculous.
Rodas, was a moderate reformer anxious to modernize the country and
turn it into a successful capitalist social democracy similar to the
Costa Rica of Pepe Figueres.<br>
<br>
Manuel Zelaya's political project was an effort to take up again the
meaning of the political programme that Modesto Rodas Alvarado
originally put to the Honduran people in the election campaign of 1963.
One can see this in the development of the Liberal Party since the
country's tenuous, nominal return to electoral democracy in 1981. In
Honduras, the National Party, whose members are called "cachurecos",
has always been the party of the conservative landowners and their
allies. The Liberal Party is disparaged by its opponents as the party
of the "chusma", the rabble, the impoverished majority.<br>
<br>
In Honduras, the effective period of military dominance lasted thirty
years - from 1963 until 1993. Throughout that period, the armed forces
dictated the acceptable parameters of political action. Political
disagreements in the army high command were at least as important as
political arguments within the two traditional political parties.
Constantly overseeing matters was the United States government,
regularly brokering policy arrangements and smoothing over fractious
splits between its local corporate allies in the Honduran plutocrat
elite and its proxies in the Honduran military high command.<br>
<br>
Left wing political input into Honduran public life was completely
marginalized until the victory of Carlos Roberto Reina in the
presidential elections of 1993. Carlos Reina represented the
centre-left current in the Liberal Party. One has to remember that the
Liberal Party has always included plutocrats like Jorge Bueso Arias,
Miguel Facussé and Carlos Flores Facussé and Jaime Rosenthal, among
several others. <br>
<br>
In 1982, Reina and like-minded Liberal Party members had&nbsp;formed
the Alianza Liberal del Pueblo in an attempt to counter the pro-US
government policy of the <i>rodista</i> Roberto Suazo Cordoba. ALIPO failed to
counteract the "dirty war" and the terror war against Nicaragua waged
by Nicaraguan Contra from Honduran territory, supervised by US
ambassador John Negroponte. Largely in protest, Carlos Reina and his
brother Jorge Arturo formed the Movimiento Liberal Democrático
Revolucionario (M-Lider). <br>
<br>
But it was the moderate <i>rodista</i> Jose Azcona Hoyo, a keen supporter of
United States regional policy, who easily won the 1985 Presidential
elections. Manuel Zelaya back then supported Azcona, not Reina. When
Carlos Reina did finally win the Presidency his administration was
hobbled by a dreadful economic situation and dramatically worsening
social problems, especially violent crime. Reina's main achievement was
to advance the subordination of the military to civilian control. <br>
<br>
Under Reina, Manuel Zelaya was director of the Honduran Social
Investment Fund, an entity whose primary purpose was to mitigate the
socially destructive effects of IMF and World Bank structural
adjustment policies like&nbsp; public spending cutbacks,
privatization and deregulation. Reina was succeeded as President by
another Liberal Party boss, Carlos Flores Facussé, a plutocrat oligarch
determined to maintain the status quo. Flores Facussé, a leading
conservative <i>rodista</i> , had been an enthusiastically pro-US minister
under the Suazo Cordoba regime duirng the "dirty war"era of the death
squads. <br>
<br>
Very close to Flores Facussé, Zelaya was given special responsibility
for reconstruction following Hurricane Mitch. In 2001, Zelaya formed
his own current within the Liberal Party, called Movimiento Esperanza
Liberal (MEL). It is worth bearing in mind what Honduran activist
Lidice Ortega thinks of Zelaya's political position, "At no time has
Mel's government been a left wing government." (2)<br>
<br>
Zelaya as President<br>
<br>
By 2005 Zelaya was able to win sufficient support from the other
Liberal party machine-bosses to secure his candidacy for the
presidential elections of that year. He campaigned on a platform of
poverty reduction and greater citizen participation in decision making.
The actual election was tainted by a long delayed count lasting almost
a month with very obvious negotiation around the results between the
leadership of the Liberal and National parties. Zelaya's resulting
administration represented a mosaic of power brokers from the various
strands of the Liberal Party.<br>
<br>
For Zelaya, the make or break measure of his government's success was
always poverty reduction within a context of political democratization
and economic modernization. The energy crisis of 2006 led to a showdown
with the corrupt monopolistic oil companies that had rigged fuel prices
for years so as to inflate their profits. Around the same time, Zelaya
refused to privatize the Hondutel state telecommunications company, as
urged by the International Monetary Fund. In both cases, Zelaya
antagonized local big business as well as foreign multinationals.<br>
<br>
Initial US government acceptance in 2006 of President Zelaya's proposal
to recoup for civilian use the US military's Palmerola-Soto Cano air
base, turned to antagonism through 2007 and 2008. Zelaya took Honduras
into the Venezuelan-led Petrocaribe energy security initiative in
December 2007, beginning his engagement with Venezuela and Cuba. Zelaya
had already completely normalized diplomatic relations with Cuba in
2007 by assigning an ambassador there for the first time since 1961. <br>
<br>
In August 2008 Honduras joined the broader regional ALBA economic and
trade bloc. That move made Honduras eligible for hundreds of millions
of dollars worth of concessionary trade deals and lines of credit,
valuable health care resources and participation in multifarious
cultural, educational and sports programmes. That decision represented
a challenge both to US government influence in Honduras and the control
of the Honduran plutocrat oligarchy of important sectors of the
Honduran economy, like pharmaceuticals or credit and other resources
for small businesses and farmers . <br>
<br>
At the end of 2008, the decision to increase the minimum wage by 60%
outraged the Honduran business and land owning oligarchy even more.
Finally, Zelaya's efforts to try and work out how to hold a Constituent
Assembly posed a fundamental threat to the traditional political
control of the country's most powerful business and media interests in
both the National Party and, especially, in the Liberal Party. The
obvious support and domestic political autonomy Zelaya had accumulated
by July 2009 destabilized the corrupt Liberal Party leadership,
epitomised by sharp, suave corporate gangsters like the Facussés and
mediocre bullies like coup regime leader Roberto Micheletti. <br>
<br>
As Zelaya's Interior Minister Victor Meza has said, in 2008 Zelaya
"became convinced that in order to change Honduras it was necessary to
break with traditional bipartisan arrangements. His change of opinion
has to do with, on the one hand his direct contact with ordinary
people, which is intense and, on the other hand, with the obstacles
created by the party leaderships and their economic interests to the
reforms he proposed. Convinced that reforms, even minimal ones, would
be impossible with the traditional parties, he bet on creating another
party." (3)<br>
<br>
Meza also makes clear that the conflict between Zelaya and the
traditional party elites predated any relationship with Venezuela,
"Zelaya's change predates his relationship with Hugo Chavez and
coincided with the increasing opposition of the communications media
who got more hostile by the day. So it is quite false that everything
results from the influence of Chavez, as the de facto regime states,
because the conflict had begun before the Venezuelan's arrival on the
scene."(4)<br>
<br>
Meza is absolutely clear that the coup d'etat originated among the
business and media-owning oligarchy who then co-opted their political
allies and the military. Along the way they seem to have readily
secured permission to go ahead with the coup from the US government.
Meza's view is confirmed by the Honduran sociologist Leticia Salomon,
who asserts that the coup was "planned by a business grouping lead by
Carlos Roberto Facussé" (5).<br>
<br>
The never-ending story<br>
<br>
The coup d'état in Honduras represents an attempt to prevent democratic
change and economic renewal so as to benefit the country's tiny
plutocrat elite of no more than ten or a dozen families. The United
States government effectively supports the coup regime because it
conveniently rolls back efforts at genuine social and economic reform
in Central America, helpfully perpetuating US dominance in the region.
A simple measure of this truth is literacy. <br>
<br>
North American and European aid has poured into Central America to the
tune of tens of billions of dollars since 1990. But literacy indicators
have either worsened or stayed the same throughout that period. In 2006
Nicaragua joined ALBA. Three years later, UNESCO has now declared
Nicaragua free of illiteracy. In Honduras, illiteracy is still around
20% in a country that never experienced the war devastation endured by
Nicaragua and El Salvador. <br>
<br>
The coup in Honduras is a symptom of the underlying imperialist cancer
eating away at Latin America's natural resources and human potential.
The complete cast of global corporate villainy nestles snugly within
the interstices of rich country debt and trade extortion backed up by
US militarism. The history of North American and European imperialist
aggression and coercion applied to weaker, resource-rich countries,
amounts to a never-ending war on the global poor. <br>
<br>
The Latin American theatre of that war now pits the US and its allies -
like Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Peru - against the ALBA countries -
Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Latin American ruling
elites expect - and receive - foreign military and economic help to
sustain their oligarchical power by denying their countries'
impoverished majorities a decent life. In all the years since Simón
Bolívar and Francisco Morazán, hardly anything has changed. As things
stand now, the chances of defeating the coup depend almost
entirely&nbsp;on the resistance of the Honduran popular movement.<br>

3. "Dos años más tarde se convence de que para cambiar Honduras es
necesario romper el bipartidismo tradicional. Su cambio de opinión
tiene que ver, por un lado, con su contacto con la gente, que es
intenso; y, por otro, con los obstáculos que las cúpulas partidistas y
los intereses económicos ponen a las reformas que propone. Convencido
de que son imposibles las reformas, así sean mínimas, con los partidos
tradicionales, le apuesta a crear otro partido." Victor Meza, in an
interview with Arturo Cano of La Jornada<br>
4. "Ese giro de Zelaya es anterior a su relación con Hugo Chávez, y
coincide con el agravamiento de la oposición de los medios de
comunicación, que se tornan cada día más hostiles. Así que es falso,
como dice el régimen *de facto*, que todo obedece a la influencia de
Chávez, porque el conflicto había comenzado antes de la aparición del
venezolano en el escenario." (Ibid)<br>
