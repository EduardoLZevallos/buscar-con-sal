for the Midday Edition of Multinoticias Channel 4<br />
<br />
2nd January, 2024</strong></em></h3>

<p class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><img alt="" height="220" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/rosario56.jpg.html" width="400" /></p>

<p>Thank you, Compañera. And we wish each other a Great Year, Blessed, truly Prosperous, truly Victorious, because we grow in the understanding of Love. Love is Great, is Powerful, is the Greatest thing that exists, Love is that Divine Energy that We all have within us and it is up to us to develop, to continue fighting with Hope, and to continue overcoming.</p>

<p>To all our People, to all Families, in all Homes, we wish you Health, first of all Health, which is what we all need to be able to vibrate in tune with these New Times... Health, Vitality, Profound Love, Understanding of Life in Community, in Family, in Home, of Life as the People of God, with Faith and Trust.</p>

<p>Because we are all children of the same Father, the Heavenly Father, who gives us that Life in Love, so that we can accept it accordingly. We are all children of the same Father, of the same Mother, and we love each other, walking in Peace and Good, walking in Work, Security, Willingness and Commitment in order to improve our Lives, to prosper, to Always go Forward!</p>

<p>We wish each other, in the Fraternal and Family Embrace of the New Year, that this 2024 strengthens those Hearts that must be filled with Love; strengthens us in Wisdom, which means understanding, the true Meaning of Life, which is precisely, being able to live together, sharing, in Solidarity and Community.</p>

<p>We wish each other the best... Life in Love, Life in Harmony, Life with Health, Life with Trust and Hope, Life in Light, Life, we repeat the term Life which is Everything, and Truth. And Let's Go Forward, and our Heart is strengthened every day in Faith, that Faith that is ours, which belongs to each one of us, that no one dictates to us, only God Our Lord.</p>

<p>And Faith does not accommodate the personal ambitions of some, or those who believe that Faith is the answer to their personal ambition, adapting Life to their designs, which are not Divine but are terribly human, and many times there are designs that we have known as diabolical, designs that cannot be understood in Good Will, that cannot be understood by fulfilling the Will of God... The Will of God, the Laws, the Commandments, of Our Lord God, who commands us to Love, to love one another and not wish harm to anyone.</p>

<p>How can we believe in People that exude evil? How can we believe in People whose loud voices speak of greed, envy, selfishness, evil? How can we believe that they can be Representatives of God on Earth...? Because God is Good, and God is Merciful, and God is the Most Powerful, the Exalted, the Divine; and the expressions of some people that we see, those familiar faces, faces of destruction, demolition, and above all of farce, deception, fraud.</p>

<p>That is not the Face of Jesus, and it is not the Face of God, it is not the Holy Face of God! Those are features that have more to do with vices and capital sins, envy, selfishness, the desire for prominence, which is selfishness, which is envy, greed, and above all, wishing evil to one's neighbor, and to a whole</p>

<p>People...! An entire People that believes in God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And Let's Go Forward, Compañer@s...! We are receiving the update of the Work Plans for this Year, we will be making them public; Plans, the quantity, the thousands of Homes that will be delivered this year, Thank God. We always say Thank God, because everything depends on Him, on that Universal, Mystical, Mysterious Energy, that Portentous Energy that is the Will of God.</p>

<p>Highways, Roads, Bridges; Health Fairs for all Health Purposes, and Specialized Fairs; the Year in Quality Education that grows, multiplies, reaches everywhere; the Year to strengthen Values, for the Youth to advance, to walk, so they can realize their dreams, at the center of this Christian, Socialist and Solidarity Project.</p>

<p>How many things...! How much we can talk about how God inspires us, enlightens us, guides us, Strengths of a Christian, Socialist and Solidarity Model! And this is a Year to walk through that Model, to carry out that Model, and to feel good, because we all try to do Good, without looking at who, and to do things better, because we have the Strength of Hope, the Strength of Ideals, of Values, of a Culture of Family, of Solidarity, of Brotherhood, of Fraternity... The Strength of Victory, of the Triumph of Love!</p>

<p>Today, Compañer@s, we are also presenting, through the Media, the Coronavirus data: 6 confirmed this week, and 8 that have already complied with the established period for Responsible and Careful Monitoring.</p>

<p>Then we also have 96.1% compliance with vaccinations, we will be announcing the National Vaccination Plan tomorrow.<br />
Then we have the data for Dengue, which decreased by 23%, Pneumonia by 33% and Malaria by 35%; also Leptospirosis, 40% less compared to last week, and Influenza, 6 positive cases so far this year, 1,189 positive cases. I think this information maybe refers to last year. I don't know. I'm going to ask for clarification.</p>

<p>Then we have those injured by gunpowder in this period: 94 People, and in the same period last year we had 55. We are going to investigate in order to see what each of us neglected.</p>

<p>Then we have the Vaccination Campaigns that will be carried out this year, from January 8 to December 27. Voluntary Vaccination against COVID, everyone wherever they wish and can.</p>

<p>Then, the National Vaccination, from April 1 to 26; Annual Vaccination against Influenza, from May 20 to 31; Second Dose of Vaccination against Human Papilloma, from May 6 to July 15; and Canine Rabies Vaccination, from August 12 to 30.</p>

<p>We also have here the Second National Vaccination Campaign, from November 25 to December 20, with God’s help.<br />
We also want to highlight that we have sent a Message of Solidarity, with a lot of Solidarity, to His Majesty Naruhito, Emperor of Japan, to His Excellency, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, conveying our Condolences for the earthquake and tsunami that has caused the loss of valuable Human lives and severe material damage in different cities of Ishikawa Prefecture.</p>

<p>With Respect and Solidarity, our best wishes for a speedy recovery go to the People of Japan, so Industrious and Fraternal, and above all we have asked the Highest Authorities of that Country to transmit our sincere Condolences and Prayers to the Families who have lost their Loved Ones.</p>

<p>We have also congratulated His Excellency Compañero Félix Tshisekedi, re-elected President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, wishing the best for his management and for the Families of that Brotherly Country.</p>

<p>Then, Compañer@s, we are, as we said, preparing the Presentations that will be made in each of the areas of greatest interest to Families; the Mayor's Offices too, of course.</p>

<p>We inaugurated the second Women's Police Station this week, No. 282, in Corinto, and the second also in San Juan de Oriente; one will be tomorrow, Wednesday, January 3, in Corinto, and in Masaya, San Juan de Oriente, on Thursday, January 4, at 10 in the morning.

For example, Totogalpa, cobblestone streets; Ciudad Antigua, 3 kilometers of road; Masaya, pavements and gutters in different neighborhoods of the City, and San Francisco Libre.</p>

<p>New tanks for Drinking Water Systems in León, for storage; there is 60% progress.</p>

<p>Then we have, in Managua we are going to deliver, God willing in 2024, 2,500 homes to the same number of Families, from the Bismarck Martínez Program, Housing Program of the Capital City. A lot of Hope, a lot of Confidence in God Our Lord, who allows us to advance along these Paths of the well-deserved Well-being for the Nicaraguan Families.</p>

<p>We have School Infrastructure in El Tortuguero: San Francisco No. 2, Centro Educativo Lajerito, Nueva Esperanza, Diriangén, Fuente del Saber; investment of almost 20 million dollars. And Master of Specialization in Initial Education and Child Development will be open these days for Pedagogical Advisors.</p>

<p>Compañer@s, again, Congratulations on this New Year, a Year to fulfill more aspirations, desires, dreams, of the Nicaraguan Families, to move forward Together, because Together we are the Victories that everyone want, for a Country like ours, for a Country like ours, Christian, Brotherhood, Socialist, Progress, Prosperity, Solidarity... Love for our Neighbor!</p>
