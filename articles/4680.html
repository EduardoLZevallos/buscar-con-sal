Far from being the “leader of the free world” and a robust democracy where the exchange of ideas is respected, the United States is under the thumb of billionaire oligarchs who restrict what we see and hear. The corporate media play the role of servant and keep the people simultaneously uninformed and misinformed. Knowledge of the rest of the world is extremely limited and only those who are sufficiently self-motivated will venture outside of the bubble. Yet doing so is imperative. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>Anyone relying on corporate media for news about Nicaragua knows nothing about the popular “vigilias” that are held on the evening of July 18. Vigilias are community rallies where the public gather to remember their successful struggle against U.S. imperialism. Like the U.S. independence day holiday, families gather with music, food, and patriotic speeches, but unlike in this country, the celebration is a righteous one. People who lived through the struggle for liberation gather together to remember and to build their country as they see fit.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>This year the revolution anniversary coincided with a crisis in U.S. politics. In 2020 Joe Biden was maneuvered into the presidency by wealthy party donors and their functionaries. In 2024 he was struggling with months of low approval ratings and a disastrous debate performance. His subsequent efforts at damage control were no better. In one interview he referred to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin as “</span></span></span></span><a class="0" href="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1813782693618012160/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/gANGgTnqUnRI8xln.mp4?tag=12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>the Black man</span></span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>” when he couldn’t remember his name. Oblivious to the fact that his campaign floundered in large part because he gave Israel a blank check of money, weapons, and impunity in the killing of some 186,000 people in Gaza, he </span></span></span></span><a class="0" href="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1813614264604880896/pu/vid/avc1/854x480/hs9f59ypWxSuVz48.mp4?tag=12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>claimed</span></span></span></span><span class="0"><span class="element-invisible"> </span></span></a><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>, “I’m the guy who did more for the Palestinian community than anybody.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>Two days after the anniversary of Sandinista victory, the oligarchs successfully completed their plan that had been in progress for some time and Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and his endorsement of  Vice President Kamala Harris. Almost immediately every sector of the Democratic Party declared loyalty to Harris and proclaimed that she was the best possible choice for president.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>The democracy that is allegedly lacking in Nicaragua is in fact missing from the U.S. Biden was put in office by rich donors in 2020 but they took him out in 2024. He was their choice because they feared that liberal reformer Bernie Sanders might again emerge as a favorite among progressive voters. They lied about Biden’s health for four years and hoped that Trump would be hobbled by his conviction for fraud and upcoming court cases charging election interference and an “insurrection” on January 6, 2021.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>The Democratic Party is facing a crisis because of its very undemocratic nature. Instead of presenting new faces to their voters, they relied on the damaged goods they were lucky to win with in 2020. They pushed Biden through again but all their luck had run out. Democratic voters were never given a real choice and are now being harangued into supporting the Kamala Harris anointing. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>Nicaragua has not aided and abetted a genocide in Gaza. Nor has it killed thousands of Ukrainians in a proxy war. It is committed to providing free health care and free university education. Both of these policies are declared to be impossibilities in the United States and are dismissed out of hand by democrats and republicans alike. Anyone advocating for these and other measures that would benefit the people is also dismissed and sent into political exile by both wings of the duopoly. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN" xml:lang="EN"><span><span><span>What is democracy? The dictionary definitions usually reference “government by the people” or similar language. The U.S. is full of legislatures at the local, state, and federal levels. They are governed by the people only when there is mass mobilization and ongoing organization by democratic forces. Otherwise, they are captives of the monied classes who decide what the people will and will not have.<br />
<br />
Ortega is quite correct. Presidents in this country are functionaries who do just what the ruling class commands them to do. They have no standing to condemn other nations. The people of the U.S. can learn from Nicaraguans and others about the necessity of struggling for a real democracy</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
