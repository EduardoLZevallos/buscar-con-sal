            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : Opposition politicians and media have
            questioned the integrity and legitimacy of the electoral
            authority and described them as &#8220;de facto&#8221;. Have you any
            observations on that criticism?<br>
            <br>
            Roberto Rivas : I think the Nicaraguan opposition to some
            degree is responsible for not having elected the authorities
            that make up the different institutions of the Nicaraguan
            State like the Judicial power, the Electoral power and the
            Auditor-General. In 2010, the President of the Republic on
            January 10th published a decree, number three of that year
            in which it stated that 25 public officials whose periods of
            office expired during that year should continue in their
            positions if there were no agreement in the country's
            parliament to elect new authorities.<br>
            <br>
            Subsequently, there also exists an article in the political
            Constitution which is Article 201, paragraph 2 of the 1987
            Constitution which has not been revoked by the different
            reforms down the years and which states that if the
            parliament does not elect new authorities then the
            authorities of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Supreme
            Electoral Council, the Auditor-General of the Republic and
            other authorities should continue in their posts.<br>
            <br>
            This happens in many countries in the world, including in
            Europe, in Spain and in many countries of South America.
            When the countries' parliaments don't agree on electing new
            authorities, logically the authorities that make up those
            institutions continue in their posts.<br>
            <br>
            I simply ask myself : What would happen to the
            constitutional duty of holding elections on November 6th
            2011 if the parliament still fails to agree on the election
            of the authorities to the Supreme Electoral Council? Would
            there not be elections so President Ortega would have to
            continue in office?<br>
            <br>
            TcS: Is the Supreme Electoral Council obliged to obey the
            ruling as regards re-election made by the Supreme Court of
            Justice?<br>
            <br>
            RR : The resolutions, and this is the Constitution, of the
            Supreme Court of Justice are binding. All the powers of
            State are obliged to obey the resolutions of the Supreme
            Court of Justice which is the body that ultimately decides
            on constitutional matters. What happened in Nicaragua is
            that&nbsp; President Ortega along with 104 of the country's
            153 mayors presented a writ to the Supreme Electoral Council
            asking for and claiming their right to elect and to be
            elected as laid out in our Magna Carta, the political
            Constitution.<br>
            <br>
            The Elecotral Council rejected that writ and resplied
            satating that teh Supreme Electoral Council was not the
            competent body to decide whether or not to accept
            re-election as such.<br>
            <br>
            On the writ being rejected by the Electoral Council,
            President Daniel Ortega, along with the 104 mayors, appealed
            to an Appeals Tribunal in Managua. The Appeals Tribunal
            accepted the appeal of President Ortega and the 104 mayors
            and passed it up to the Constitutional Division of the
            Supreme Court of Justice. That body ruled that in fact
            President Ortega and the 104 mayors had the right to elect
            and to be rlected which is a citizen's right enshrined in
            the political Constitution of the Republic.<br>
            <br>
            Subsequently again, this ruling was passed to the ultimate
            tribunal which is the Supreme Court of Justice and the Court
            in plenary session ratified the resolution of its
            Constitutional Division.<br>
            This is something we have seen not just in Nicaragua.
            Recently we saw the re-election of President Arias in the
            Republic of Costa Rica, who even spent some time waiting for
            the Fourth Chamber of Costa Rica's Supreme Court&nbsp;
            permitting him to be re-elected. A similar situation also
            arose in the Republic of Colombia&nbsp; with the re-election
            of President Uribe based on a resolution of the Supreme
            Court there and we have seen the same&nbsp; in different
            countries in Latin America.<br>
            <br>
            I think re-election is not something negative. Re-election
            should be permitted in every country in teh world because it
            is something that gives to the citizen exercising a
            country's premier office the possibility of continuing a
            project and peoples expressing themselves via their vote on
            election day will know whetehr to reward or punish whoever
            has led a good government or whoever has led a bad
            government.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : The opposition also claim that the elections cannot be
            valid without international election observation. Is that a
            matter of concern for you and your colleagues?<br>
            <br>
            RR : I've been a magistrate of the Supreme Electoral Council
            in Nicaragua for 16 or 17 years, I've lost count. Nicaragua
            has its own characteristics. It is a power of State. It is
            one of the four pillars of the Nicaraguan State, in the same
            way as the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature and
            so I think electoral matters are an issue for Nicaraguan,
            not for the international community. The President and the
            authorities that get elected are to to govern us Nicaraguans
            not to govern the rest of the world. <br>
            <br>
            However, Nicaragua has been a country&nbsp; that has
            permitted electoral accompaniment or observation . It did so
            in 1990, with an army of observers so there were almost more
            observers than voters at teh time. Also there was
            observation in 1996 with the election of Dr. Arnoldo
            Alem&aacute;n as President. There was too in 2001 with the
            election of President Enrique Bola&ntilde;os. And there was
            in 2006. Now the Electoral Council on August 16th this
            year&nbsp; is going to rule on international accompaniment.<br>
            <br>
            Accompaniment is a new term that has gained currency in
            relation to electoral observation, in practice it amounts to
            the same and I always say that accompaniment is a stronger
            concept because it allows me to be alongside people. But I
            think we Nicaraguans are the ones who are responsible
            directly participating firstly as voters, secondly as
            members of the political parties, thirdly as the
            parties'&nbsp; polling officers supervising whether the
            electoral process is transparent or not.<br>
            <br>
            Now it's superfluous to say that our electoral processes
            have been transparent. In 1990, President Ortega lost the
            election when he was a candidate. In 1996 Daniel Ortega was
            also a candidate when Dr. Alem&aacute;n won. In 2001,
            President Bola&ntilde;os won when Daniel Ortega was as
            candiate and in 2006 President Daniel Ortega did indeed win
            the elections against other candidates.<br>
            <br>
            So I think for the Nicaraguan people in the same way that we
            talk about all of Latin America, democracy expresses itself
            through the polling booth and therefore this is the
            competency of Nicaraguans. But in any case we are not
            against the idea. We're going to issue regulations taking
            into consideration the notions of the European Union on
            electoral observation,also what the United Nations charter
            says about electoral observation and what the Organization
            of American States says.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore we will take into consideration some regulations
            of certain countries as has been the case with
            M&eacute;xico, Venezuela, as has been the case of Costa Rica
            too, of Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay,Uruguay, in sum
            all the countries of Latin America, and even Europe too, for
            the regulations to be set out for observers.<br>
            <br>
            We are not against accompaniment. What we oppose is
            intervention, that people come here as delegates of the
            international community to serve merely as complaints
            offices or wanting to intervene or interfere in the
            electoral processes. We are completely open. We have nothing
            to hide in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            Here there's going to be an electoral process as transparent
            as they have always been, a process as legitimate as it has
            always been, at least so long as the deputies currently in
            the National Assembly turn up saying the electoral process
            of 2006 was illegitimate and so therefore they should not be
            deputies in the National Assembly. I don't think they're
            about to say that now after five years of carrying out their
            duties.<br>
            <br>
            So in that case, here there is nothing against international
            accompaniment, but there is against intervention in
            electoral matters. We cannot permit intervention. We welcome
            the international community that want to come within the
            regulations that the Supreme Electoral Council establishes
            for that end and always assuming that they are invited by
            the Republic's Foreign Ministry which is our gateway to the
            world.<br>
            <br>
            TcS: Recently, an allegation has been made by the Etica y
            Transparencia organization suggesting that more than 1000
            polling stations might be open to fraud or manipulation in
            the forthcoming elections. Can you comment?<br>
            <br>
            RR: I think Etica y Transparencia are looking for publicity
            so as to attract international financial support, to pay for
            all their highly paid staff without publishing their
            financial statements. That for one thing. But I cannot prove
            that and so I only offer that as the view of one citizen on
            what Etica y Transparencia might be like rather than as an
            accusation.<br>
            <br>
            Secondly, Etica y Transparencia talk about 1200 polling
            stations, which is a statement that already incriminates the
            organization insomething that would have to be investigated
            perhaps even by the Electoral Fiscal Office, given that if
            they have proof that there is going to be fraud in 1200
            polling stations, well they will have to demonstrate
            it,&nbsp; how that fraud is going to be done, because as of
            now we have absolutely no indication that there is going to
            be anything different from all the previous electoral
            processes.<br>
            <br>
            And perhaps it's important for the world to know that Etica
            y Transparencia have served as little more than a launching
            pad for individuals who want to be Presidential candidates,
            as was the case of Carlos Tunnerman Bernheim who was a
            candidate for the Vice-Presidency.<br>
            <br>
            So what am I to say? Those 1200 polling stations at risk of
            fraud do not exist. That is a falsehood. Totally false. If
            the political parties have doubts then they have only to
            worry about there being a fiscal officer for each political
            party from each one of the five political alliances in every
            one of&nbsp; more than 13000polling stations and there they
            can see, ratify and sign the electoral count documents and
            that way the Nicaraguan people will know who was elected and
            the legitimacy of their election.<br>
