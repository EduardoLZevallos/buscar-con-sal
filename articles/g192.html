<br>(Note: the summit has been postponed by a vote this week of the General Assembly until Junes 24th)<br><br>
President of the 63rd Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), Miguel
D'Escoto, is at the front of the organization of a historic global
heads of state summit to discuss the impact of and response to the
global financial crisis. The summit will take place between June 1st -
3rd at the UN headquarters in New York. As part of the outcome of the
UN International Conference on Financing for Development (Doha,
December 2008), senior government representatives from over 160 UN
member countries signed a request to D'Escoto to organize such a global
conference at the highest level.<br><br>
As D'Escoto (former Nicaraguan foreign minister, 1979 - 1990) explains
in a recent interview with Cuba's official newspaper Granma, the reason
the upcoming conference is both historic and radical is that, during
the existence of the UN system "it is been prohibited for the General
Assembly to discuss or intervene in international financial affairs,
such matters were reserved for the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and the World Trade Organization."<br>
<br>
He argues that the rules of the existing International Economic Order
"were imposed" on the world by the US and other nations that considered
themselves "victors" of the Second World War. "So this summit will the
be the first time in the history of the UN that we are saying to
everyone, 'come and lets all talk about the International Economic
Order'."<br>
<br>
D'Escoto, who during his time at the head of the UNGA has been the
target of fierce criticism by Western Bloc representatives and snide
reports by Western corporate media, further explained the importance of
the June summit during a press conference at the UN office in Geneva in
early May: "In the 21st Century, the century of inclusive democracy ...
the idea that a minority can go on making decisions for everyone else
must be forgotten about. With all due respect to the G20, those
countries represent a minority. It is the G192, represented at the UN
General Assembly, that must decide our future."<br>
<br>
Outcome document watered down after initial consultations<br>
<br>
On May 8th D'Escoto presented the first draft of the outcome document
to be discussed and adopted during the summit. The document is the
result of five months of intensive investigation led by the Commission
of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial
System, a process of in-depth consultation and discussion at the UNGA
and other forums, and inputs from specialized UN agencies, civil
society organizations and private sector representatives.<br>
<br>
The Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and
Financial System was set up by D'Escoto in December and is comprised of
economists and finance officials from all global regions. Nobel award
winning economist Joseph Stiglitz presides the commission.<br>
<br>
On May 18th following informal consultations with member countries the
first revised version of the outcome document was presented. Currently
formal consultations with all UN member countries are taking place
prior to the presentation of the second revised version immediately
before the summit.<br>
<br>
The first revised version of the outcome document is half the length of
its predecessor and less progressive both in terms of the language used
and the recommendations made.<br>
<br>
The original draft gives specific recommendations about the creation of
nine new global entities to oversee and regulate the global economic
and financial system including a global tax authority, a global
financial regulatory authority, a global economic coordination
authority and a world monetary board. The officials of these global
entities, states the original document, would be elected by and
answerable to the UNGA. Until the consolidation of these global
institutions is achieved, the document concludes, "globalization will
continue to lead the world into chaos."<br>
<br>
The lines of actions recommended in the first revised version are not
so bold. Although the need for the reform of existing global financial
and economic entities and the creation of new such entities is
underlined, less detail is given about these proposed changes.<br>
<br>
Another of the many specifics that was omitted from the revised version
was the recommendation that nations should be charged for use of global
public goods such as oceans, space and cyberspace, as well as for
carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. The funds made available
as a result of this international taxing system would be used as
financing sources for sustainable development in the majority world.
Funds from the carbon tax would be used to provide humanitarian
assistance to environmental refugees.<br>
<br>
Despite amendments, revised document still opposes continuation of
current economic order<br>
<br>
Despite the watering down of the most progressive statements and
conclusions, the revised version of the document describes the
globalized economic order as "unsuitable" for the 21st century
underlining the failures of the international financial institutions,
the inappropriateness of national currencies being used as
international reserve currencies and the unquestionable need for more
and better government involvement in the economy.<br>
<br>
Detail is given to describing the impact of the crisis on individuals
and societies around the world: "Hundreds of millions of people all
over the world are losing their jobs, their income, their savings,
their homes and their ability to survive. The number of chronically
malnourished is expected to rise to over one billion. ...<br>
<br>
"The greatest impacts may be difficult to quantify, [however]. At its
heart, the present crisis is a crisis of human security ... the impacts
[of which] include the evaporation of hope in a better future ... and
fear of what tomorrow may bring. ... This crisis has put a
disproportionate burden on women who also face greater income
insecurity and increased burdens of family care. ... [Furthermore, the
crisis] has exacerbated the challenges and impediments to attaining
internationally agreed development goals. ... It risks becoming a
social and human crisis with implications for political stability and
peace."<br>
<br>
Among the concrete orientations for lines of action in the revised
version is the request that the UN General Secretary should immediately
develop a proposal for a UN Vulnerability Monitoring and Response
Mechanism and a strategy setting out the UN system's response to the
crisis. The UN General Secretary is also requested to monitor and
report on international institutions' compliance with announced
commitments for institutional, assistance and policy reform.<br>
<br>
A number of mechanisms are recommended in order to ensure the
continuation of initiatives from the summit can be monitored. These
include; the creation of a new Global Economic Council within the UN
system to "provide coordination and oversight of the response to global
challenges"; the revision of the agreements between the UN and the
Bretton Woods organizations in an attempt to "enhance cooperation" with
the UN and to "strengthen the development mandates of both
institutions."<br>
<br>
Finally, the President of the UNGA is instructed to ensure the
continuity of the global forum on the global financial crisis naming
specialized work groups and organizing future high level meetings.<br>
<br>
EU attempts to undermine summit<br>
<br>
As can be expected, rich country governments are less than happy about
the summit and the processes that may be set into motion as a result of
the encounter. During the previously mentioned press conference in
Geneva on May 12th, Miguel D'Escoto commented on what he described as
"a coming together of the representatives of the European Union against
the [first draft of the] outcome document."<br>
<br>
The European Union (EU) presented its criticism as being in relation to
procedural imperfections. According to D'Escoto, however, the EU has
been opposed to the summit from the beginning, given their insistence
that the conference to be solely about the impact of the crisis on
developing countries and not about the International Economic Order in
general.<br>
<br>
It is beyond doubt that Western Bloc powers are busy pressurizing
friendly heads of government in the majority world not to attend the
summit or not to sign the summit declaration. One wonders to what
extent this strategy will succeed, however.<br>
<br>
As events in the Central American and Caribbean region have
demonstrated, circumstances have made it harder than ever for even
centre and right wing governments to maintain a position of
unquestioning submission to US and European powers. With nothing to
offer in terms of resolving the Central American and Caribbean nations'
chronic and worsening energy crisis, the US has watched one "ally"
after another sign onto Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez' regional
energy integration initiative Petrocaribe.<br>
<br>
No matter how strong an ideological affinity majority world political
parties and individual leaders may feel with Western Bloc powers, as
politicians their first thought has to be how to guarantee public
support at home. Few political parties are able to maintain support if
they are unable to access the resources they need to avoid dramatic
drops in people's standard of living.<br>
<br>
Organizers may have compromised to ensure consensus<br>
<br>
As Miguel D'Escoto has stated many times, in order for the conclusions
of the June summit to command the respect of the international
community the outcome document must be signed by as many member
countries' heads of state as possible. It may not be unreasonable,
therefore, to assume that the revisions made to the first draft of the
outcome document were deemed necessary by the organizers in order to
counteract the possibility of an overly progressive document putting
off centre and right wing majority world governments susceptible to
Western Bloc demands.<br>
<br>
In terms of whether near unanimous support for the summit's declaration
could achieve even a fraction of the proposed reform of the
International Economic Order, it is hard not to be sceptical. In the
short term, certain superficial changes may well result, for example
the transition from the use of the US dollar as the international
reserve currency to some other arrangement. (According to D'Escoto
there is almost complete global consensus on this issue going into the
meeting.) But obviously what really matters is the arrangement that
replaces the current system.<br>
<br>
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was recently quoted saying that
the US is "quite open" to some IMF-based alternative to the US dollar's
status as reserve currency. The alternative the US is open to
exploring, however, involves an increase in the use of the IMF's
Special Drawing Rights, something that would ensure rich nation's
continuing control over the management of the international reserve
currency system.<br>
<br>
According to current UN rules, it is impossible for the UNGA to oblige
global powers to obey its resolutions. If this summit can provoke some
progress in the implementation of mechanisms that project the voice and
influence of the UNGA (the only universal body made up of sovereign
states) on the stage of global power politics then it should be
considered a success. Perhaps the most important thing the summit has
the potential to achieve is to strengthen majority world opposition to
the status quo imposed on humanity by Western Bloc imperialism.<br>
