                wrong on Nicaragua</span><br>
              <br>
              by toni solo, January 29th 2009</span><br>
            <br>
            On January 11th, the UK's Observer newspaper published&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/11/nicaragua-world-ortega">an
              article on Nicaragua</a>.(1) The Observer is one of a
            group of prestigious social
            democrat European newspapers who all tend to filter news on
            Latin
            America via fiction, half-truths and downright lies. The
            Observer
            article sticks faithfully to that habitual propaganda modus
            operandi,
            breaking into the truth about Nicaragua, rifling everything
            worth
            knowing, leaving the reader with nothing worth having. A
            quick review
            of the current international context will help, before
            looking at the
            article itself.<br>
            <br>
            Right now, North America and Europe are in the process of
            losing the
            economic and political advantage they inherited from the
            colonial era.
            For more than fifty years, since 1945, they sustained that
            advantage
            via a neocolonial system of measureless brutality, hypocrisy
            and
            cynicism. The recent zionist massacres of Palestinians in
            Gaza are the
            latest in a long history of European and North American
            genocide
            against the peoples of the world, carried out either
            directly by their
            own armed forces or indirectly by client-aggressors like
            Israel in
            Palestine, for example, or Ethiopia in Somalia recently, or
            Rwanda in
            the Democratic Republic of&nbsp; Congo.<br>
            <br>
            Other writers have noted the massacres perpetrated by the
            French in
            Madagascar or in Setif in Algeria. One might also point to
            the
            massacres in Korea under the command of US Army General John
            R. Hodge
            who wrote in 1946 "our imperialism hasn't been a bad
            imperialism".
            Hodge wrote just months after the US attacked defenceless
            civilian
            populations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs,
            killing
            hundreds of thousands of people. Two years later Korean
            forces under US
            command massacred around 80,000 people on the island of
            Cheju. That
            genocide was all of a piece with the earlier US military
            record in the
            Philippines or in Nicaragua, for example.<br>
            <br>
            Madagascar, Setif, Cheju are just a few instances of the
            systematic
            genocidal violence applied for centuries by the imperialist
            powers
            against populations who resisted them. In Latin America and
            the
            Caribbean over the last fifty years or so, that violence has
            generally
            been applied by imperialist clients. But the intellectual
            authors have
            always been the same : the North Americans and the
            Europeans. Their
            fundamental attitude never varies : they are superior, their
            lives are
            important, the lives of the rest are not important, because
            they are
            inferior.<br>
            <br>
            Bloodthirsty servants of the imperialist powers, like
            Augusto Pinochet,
            the Argentinian generals who ran that country's dirty war,
            the Central
            American oligarchs, narco-terror gangsters like Alvaro Uribe
            in
            Colombia - all of them have had at the very least tacit
            approval of the
            imperialist governments. By contrast, revolutionary
            governments never
            have. The North Americans and Europeans have collaborated
            for decades
            so as to maintain a status quo favourable to their corporate
            interests.
            Just in the last ten years they have overthrown President
            Jean Bertrand
            Aristide in Haiti, tried to overthrow President Hugo Chavez
            in
            Venezuela, attempted to foment civil war in Bolivia,
            supported a
            destabilizing strike in Argentina, actively promoted State
            terrorism in
            Colombia, ignored gross human rights violations in Mexico
            and Peru and
            maintained a permanent criminal blockade of the people of
            Cuba.<br>
            <br>
            So it is completely normal for the corporate media of those
            imperialist
            countries to reflect the very same hypocrisy and cynicism as
            their
            governments. The two elements - government and corporate
            media -
            complement each other. They are part of the same global
            neocolonialist
            system that has sustained the historical privilege and
            domination of
            the old imperialist powers and their peoples since the
            Second World
            War. Here, we return to the Observer's article on Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            Most of the article consists of the reporter's subjective
            impressions,
            false accusations treated as fact, minimal concrete data and
            no firm
            statistics. It is based almost entirely on comments from
            opposition
            political figures and anonymous sources. The mixture of
            truth and
            falsehood can be seen in remarks like "International donors
            have
            slashed aid and business confidence has collapsed." It is
            true that the
            Commission of the European Union, along with Holland and
            Finland have
            said they are suspending aid - the context of that is very
            instructive.
            Other important donor countries like Germany and Spain have
            explicitly
            not done so. But to report that business confidence has
            collapsed is
            completely untrue. The opposite is the case.<br>
            <br>
            Business confidence in Nicaragua has recovered dramatically
            since 2006,
            with export growth of over 30% in 2007 and over 20% in 2008.
            The 12
            hour daily power cuts that characterized the previous
            government of
            Ing. Enrique Bolaños - coddled and cosseted by the Europeans
            and the
            North Americans - have gone. There is more than sufficient
            electrical
            energy for the country now - a stunning achievement in just
            two years,
            due entirely to the vigorous policies of the FSLN government
            under its
            President, Daniel Ortega. The Observer's reporters need to
            explain how
            it is that a leading right wing banker and economist like
            Francisco
            Mayorga, former head of Nicaragua's Central Bank under
            President
            Violeta Chamorro, suggested recently that Nicaragua might
            well be
            better placed than other countries facing into the deepening
            international economic crisis.<br>
            <br>
            The government has managed to control inflation at levels
            slightly less
            than in neighbouring Costa Rica. Foreign currency reserves
            are well
            over US$1bn - a good level for Nicaragua historically.
            Compared to the
            situation two years ago the economy is in incomparably
            better shape,
            despite the international crisis. For a more realistic
            perspective, one
            has only to ask where in North America or Europe business
            confidence
            has not collapsed. Looked at that way, one can see that
            Nicaragua is in
            relatively good shape to face the coming challenges. By
            contrast, for
            example, the British leader of the opposition has suggested
            that Prime
            Minister Gordon Brown may end up going begging for help to
            the IMF.<br>
            <br>
            The most obvious dishonesty of&nbsp;The Observer article is
            its use
            of
            comments from a group including the novelist Sergio Ramirez,
            the
            journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the politician Dora
            Maria Téllez
            and the feminist activist Sofia Montenegro. What unites
            these four
            individuals is their membership of, or enthusiastic support
            for, the
            social democrat political alliance led by the Sandinista
            Renewal
            Movement (MRS). In the most dishonest way possible, the
            Observer
            studiedly fails to mention that fact, which casts the
            comments of those
            individuals in a completely different, less plausible,
            light. They are
            not random individuals who all happen to think the same.
            They are a
            ruthless, close-knit clique of political losers trying to
            compensate
            for their domestic political failure by leveraging their
            professional
            prestige abroad.<br>
            <br>
            Sofia Montenegro is the perrenial leader of the Autonomous
            Women's
            Movement (MAM), part of the MRS political alliance. In 2008,
            an
            investigation by Nicaragua's Office of Public Prosecution
            discovered
            that foreign governments had funded MAM under the table via
            donations
            triangulated via OXFAM and the CINCO non-governmental
            organization run
            by Carlos Fernando Chamorro. The annoyance of the foreign
            governments
            involved at having being caught red-handed funding part of
            the
            country's political opposition probably had much to do with
            the
            hardening of their feelings against Nicaragua's Sandinista
            government.<br>
            <br>
            But none of that highly relevant context appears in the
            article in The
            Observer. It does not mention that Sergio Ramirez founded
            the MRS. Nor
            does it note that Dora Maria Tellez, as President of the MRS
            at the
            time, worked for years with the FSLN as part of the National
            Convergence political alliance. All this information puts a
            very
            different aspect on the remarks of these individuals against
            President
            Daniel Ortega and his FSLN government.<br>
            <br>
            The most important information about the MRS, for anyone
            reading the
            Observer article, is that now the party's national support
            is
            certainly&nbsp;less than
            5% of the country's electorate. It has progressively lost
            support since
            its humiliating defeat in the presidential elections of
            2006. In fact,
            in 2008 it reached the point where it could not sustain its
            legality as
            a political party after repeated requests from the national
            electoral
            authority for the MRS to supply basic details specifying its
            departmental and municipal organizational structure. Just
            prior to the
            2008 municipal elections both in Managua the capital and in
            various of
            the country's provincial departments, important sections of
            the MRS
            party's activist base deserted back to the FSLN because they
            resented
            the dictatorial imposition by the party leadership of a
            tactical
            electoral alliance with the extreme right wing.<br>
            <br>
            Absolutely none of that vital context appears in the
            Observer report.
            By means of that dishonest omission, the Observer absurdly
            overrates
            the
            importance of remarks by MRS leaders and supporters whose
            influence
            dwindles almost by the day within Nicaragua. If they are
            influential,
            it is because Carlos Fernando Chamorro is a member of a
            family media
            dynasty that dominates the newspaper business in Nicaragua.
            Any mention
            of that fact by the Observer would have chimed ill with the
            MRS
            leadership's bogus
            claims of a Sandinista dictatorship, which they have been
            putting about
            for two years now. So, despite admitting, reluctantly, that
            Nicaragua
            shows none of the signs of a police state, the Observer
            report
            implicitly sustains the false accusation that Daniel Ortega
            wants to
            impose one.<br>
            <br>
            The MRS leadership still enjoy the prestige they earned as
            members of
            the first Sandinista revolutionary government in the 1980s.
            They also
            maintain friendships they forged in those years with leading
            intellectuals like Noam Chomsky, José Saramago, Salman
            Rushdie and
            others. These internationally famous personalities
            occasionally make
            ill-informed pronouncements about Nicaragua based on those
            friendships.
            Their remarks contribute no worthwhile information about
            Nicaragua but
            conveniently serve the propaganda requirements of media
            outlets like
            The Observer so as to smear the Sandinista government.<br>
            <br>
            It is worth asking why the Observer is so ready to retail
            the crude
            personal insults and avowedly political accusations it
            quotes against
            Daniel Ortega and his wife Rosario Murillo. It quotes the
            opinion of
            Sofia Montenegro that Ortega is another Robert Mugabe or
            Papa Doc and
            that the FSLN party he leads is like the mafia. But, after
            all, it was
            Montenegro who was discovered, along with Carlos Fernando
            Chamorro,
            abusing the norms of financial transparency on development
            cooperation
            funding, with the aim of financing Montenegro's
            organization, a part of
            the MRS political alliance.<br>
            <br>
            The FSLN government has dramatically improved the situation
            in
            Nicaragua in very concrete ways. This is evident, to take a
            few
            examples of many, from the greater number of people with
            access to
            drinking water, much higher numbers of people receiving
            public health
            care, a dramatic decline in maternal mortality, a marked
            decline in
            scholastic desertion in the public education system, much
            lower figures
            for illiteracy, greater macro-economic stability, very
            important
            advances in Nicaragua's food security, a decisive increase
            in credit
            for previously excluded economic sectors and the very high
            percentage -
            around 40% - of women in executive positions in the
            government.<br>
            <br>
            The Sandinista government has achieved all that in just two
            years. But
            for power-obssessed individuals like Sofia Montenegro and
            their media
            accomplices, none of that exists. As Harold Pinter might
            have put it,
            it never happened. That denial of readily verifiable
            improvements in
            standard socio-economic indicators is to be expected from
            people like
            Montenegro and Chamorro. These are individuals who refused
            to cooperate
            with an&nbsp;investigation by the public prosecutor's office
            because they were desperate to cover up
            funding for Montenegro's party-politically aligned
            organization with
            money intended for development cooperation. In that context,
            the
            government emerges with more credibility than either
            Montenegro or
            Chamorro, which is presumably why The Observer failed to
            report the
            facts.<br>
            <br>
            In the same way, Montenegro and her MRS colleagues slander
            Rosario
            Murillo, who runs the Nicaraguan government's public
            relations. Murillo
            is a constant target of insults and attacks. Montenegro,
            supposedly a
            feminist, instead of celebrating Murillo's unarguable
            success as a
            talented politician and leading public figure, strings along
            with&nbsp;Nicaragua's machista politicians and right wing
            media,
            who all hate
            Murillo. In the Observer article, Montenegro compares
            Murillo to Sarah
            Palin, John McCain's running mate in the last US
            presidential election.
            But Palin is someone who supports the death penalty, the
            wars in Iraq
            and Afghanistan and the genocide of the Palestinians - the
            very
            antithesis of Murillo's humanitarian, anti-imperialist,
            democratic
            political
            positions. One has to stop and wonder at this irrational and
            absurd
            comparison.
            Here, one is very close to the deep psychological springs of
            the
            Nicaraguan opposition's hatred for Daniel Ortega and his
            government.<br>
            <br>
            If one looks at political life in the Central American
            region for a
            politician more talented, influential and capable than
            Daniel Ortega,
            it is hard to see a likely candidate. Neither Toni Saca of
            El Salvador,
            Manuel Zelaya of Honduras nor Alvaro Colom of Guatemala
            match up to
            Ortega in terms of experience or achievement. Possibly Oscar
            Arias.
            Oscar Arias can certainly compete with Ortega in terms of
            international
            prestige. But in the majority world of Asia. Africa and
            Latin America,
            Ortega probably enjoys more prestige than Arias, the darling
            of the
            Europeans and the North Americans.<br>
            <br>
            If one tries the same experiment in the case of Rosario
            Murillo, it is
            impossible to find a woman politician in Central America
            more
            successful or influential in the political life of their
            country than
            Murillo. Like it or not, Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo
            stand head
            and shoulders above their Central American counterparts,
            with the
            possible exception of Oscar Arias. That is why their enemies
            hate them
            so desperately. Mediocrity and failure loath talent and
            success. Ortega
            and Murillo have notched up political achievements their
            enemies cannot
            match. All this explains a great deal of the false and
            fictitious
            content of the article in The Observer which, despite the
            FSLN
            administration's impressive record, fails to admit any
            significant
            achievement by the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            If one analyzes the coup d'etat in Haiti in 2004 or North
            American and
            European conduct in Palestine or perhaps in Somalia too,
            there is a
            common approach. The majorities in those countries choose a
            government
            not to the liking of the imperialist powers. Aghast at real
            demcracy in
            action, the imperialist powers
            then make alliances with ruthess local anti-democratic
            minorities. They
            feed them and build them up. They exaggerate their claims
            and
            influence. They fund them and help them consolidate. They
            even equip
            them with weapons. On the other hand, to the freely chosen
            governments,
            they deny resources and aid. They trash their achievements.
            They do
            everything possible to weaken and undermine them. If
            necessary they
            will attack them. That same pattern has occurred in
            Venezuela, in
            Bolivia, in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            Despite the efforts of the imperialist governments to date,
            the list of
            achievements by Nicaragua's Sandinista government is long
            and explains
            on its own the stunning defeat of the opposition parties in
            the
            municipal elections of 2008. The FSLN now controls 109 out
            of a total
            of 153 municipalities in the country. The article in the
            Observer
            touches on those municipal elections but offers no plausible
            facts on
            which to base its insistent suggestion that they were
            fraudulent.<br>
            <br>
            That is to be expected. No such plausible facts exist. The
            same
            electoral authorities, using the same procedures, supervised
            the
            postponed elections in seven municipalities in the
            Autonomous Northern
            Atlantic Region that took place on January 18th this year.
            The area is
            traditionally opposition territory politically, but the FSLN
            still won
            four out of the seven municipalities. The opposition did not
            claim
            fraud. Just as there was no fraud in the elections of
            January 18th 2009
            nor was there in the elections of November 9th 2008. <br>
            <br>
            Not one concrete argument the opposition have offered to
            back up their
            allegations of fraud stands up against the explanations
            given by the
            electoral authorities. The opposition have failed to
            substantiate
            claims that legitimately accredited party officials were
            unfairly
            denied access
            to the count process, that there were no election observers,
            or that
            the election observers were biased, that the official
            results were
            corrupted. They have exploited ignorance and confusion about
            the
            country's electoral law and the process of administrative
            challenges of
            results in specific voting stations to the electoral
            authorities at
            municipal and departmental level. They perpetuate the
            downright
            falsehood that the Supreme Electoral Council is controlled
            by the FSLN.<br>
            <br>
            The Observer fails to note any of that context. Nor does it
            note other
            relevant incidents relating to the bitter conflicts between
            different
            factions of the Nicaraguan opposition. In one incident José
            Marenco an
            opposition magistrate of the Supreme Electoral Council was
            so enraged
            at comments by fellow party member José Pallais that he rang
            up the
            phone-in programme Pallais was appearing on and tackled
            Pallais's
            falsehoods on air. Marenco accused Pallais and his
            colleagues of being
            hypocrites. His clear meaning during the exchange was that
            the
            opposition leaders admitted their electoral defeat in
            private but
            falsely denounced fraud for public consumption so as to
            justify their
            categorical electoral defeat.<br>
            <br>
            There is plenty more context like that around the aftermath
            of the
            controversial elections of November 9th, all of it ignored
            by the
            Observer. The Observer came to Nicaragua with its script
            already
            sketched out. All it needed was some lines for its
            characters to speak.
            Another example of vital context ignored by the Observer is
            its
            assertion, "Téllez, a health minister in the first elected
            Sandinista
            administration, staged a hunger strike last year to protest
            at the
            banning of her party, a breakaway Sandinista group, from the
            elections." But the report does not make clear that it was
            the right
            wing PLC opposition party that initiated the legal
            administrative
            procedure culminating in the disappearance of the MRS as a
            political
            party. The Observer report implies government skulduggery.
            But the
            government did nothing.<br>
            <br>
            The reason for that right wing opposition manoeuvre
            vis-a-vis the MRS
            was
            to clear the way for an undivided opposition vote in the all
            important municipal election in Managua, so as to favour the
            extreme
            right
            winger Eduardo Montealegre,&nbsp;preferred candidate of the
            US
            embassy
            and the European Union. It was only to be expected when
            Tellez and
            fellow MRS leader Edmundo Jarquin then brazenly urged their
            supporters
            to vote
            for right-winger Montealegre, since that had almost
            certainly
            been&nbsp;strategy all along. The Observer explains none of
            this
            context
            , essential to even begin to grasp what was going on in
            Nicaraguan
            politics around the municipal elections.<br>
            <br>
            All of this gives some idea of the really deep dishonesty,
            the
            mendacity, the truly fictional nature of The Observer's
            journalism in
            its report of January 11th. And it is important to realise
            this when
            considering the
            issue of foreign development cooperation in Nicaragua. A
            faithful
            report of
            that issue would turn on the thoroughgoing hypocrisy of
            European and
            North American governments. They know they are dealing with
            a highly
            competent, disciplined and determined government in
            Nicaragua. They are
            desperate to stymie successful outcomes for that
            government's
            programme. All through 2008 the European Union and other
            foreign donors
            used delaying tactics hoping to be able to use the pretext
            of electoral
            fraud in the November municipal elections to justify not
            releasing long
            agreed funding. They had no solid reasons to withhold that
            funding
            right through the period up to the elections. As soon as the
            fake-fraud
            trap was sprung by their proxies in the Nicaraguan
            opposition, they
            acted.<br>
            <br>
            Now, after the elections of the new Executive Committee in
            the National
            Assembly one can see that one faction of the opposition -
            the PLC
            faction loyal to corrupt ex-President Arnoldo Aleman - only
            used the
            false allegations of fraud so as to pressure the FSLN
            government into
            not opposing the reversal of Arnoldo Aleman's conviction on
            extremely
            serious charges of corruption. Once that was achieved and
            Aleman was
            free once more, everything returned to normal. The crisis
            vanished. The
            fraud has been forgotten, except for moments when, like a
            malingering
            dog that fakes a limp looking for sympathy, the opposition
            remember it
            and hoping to squeeze out yet one more political concession.<br>
            <br>
            Given The Observer's flagrant dishonesty in omitting highly
            relevant
            context, it is understandable their reporter had no
            difficulty finding
            anonymous sources from foreign development cooperation
            programmes to
            criticize the government. The outfits – governmental and
            non-governmental - involved in those programmes failed to
            achieve in 16
            years what the Sandinista government has achieved in two.
            The various
            elements of the governments poverty reduction programme
            benefit
            hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans every year now, even
            without
            taking into account the benefits of dramatic improvements in
            access to
            education and health care.<br>
            <br>
            One has to remember that the European and North American
            governments
            repeatedly praised the previous administration of Enrique
            Bolaños for
            its anti-corruption struggle : blackguards puffing up
            poltroons.
            Clearly, what they meant to praise was the&nbsp;Bolaños
            administration's
            implementation of styles and varieties of corruption more to
            the taste
            of its North American and European patrons. The government
            of Enrique
            Bolaños was deeply corrupt in the best hypocritical European
            style
            paying its officials and all those foreign consultants
            grossly inflated
            salaries and per diems, along with all kinds of superfluous
            perquisites.<br>
            <br>
            People in Nicaragua had to wait for the Sandinista
            government in order
            to get an administration determined on cutting to reasonable
            levels the
            massively inflated salaries paid under previous governments.
            Daniel
            Ortega implemented that measure the very day he and his
            ministers took
            office. Nicaragua's Comptroller General's office, a
            politically
            independent body, announced in September 2008 it had not
            needed to
            process any government functionary for corruption in over 18
            months.
            None of that information appears in The Observer's reporting
            on
            Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            The horrifying events in Gaza over the last while, in
            Lebanon in 2006,
            in Haiti in 2004 and over so&nbsp; many years in Palestine,
            Somalia, Iraq, and Africa's Great Lakes region, all
            demonstrate beyond
            argument the anti-humanitarian, anti-democratic, sadistic
            and cynical
            nature of the North American and European imperialist
            powers. If their
            behaviour has changed over the last 50 years it has been for
            the worse.
            It makes sense that their corporate media, like The
            Observer, operate
            with the same mendacity, the same cynicism, the same
            hypocrisy. These
            are exactly the qualities of its January 11th report on
            Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            Note<br>
            1. The original article appeared on January 11th in the
            Observer
            section of the guardian.co.uk web site with the byline "The
            Observer".
            Subsequently the byline changed to "Rory Carroll, The
            Observer".
            Personally, I think various hands wrote the article because
            it bears
            some of the stylistic touches one might expect from the
            Observer's
            Foreign Affairs editor, Peter Beaumont. I don't refer to
            Rory Carroll
            here because it seems to me that he and people like himself
            or Peter
            Beaumont are mostly ciphers operating a systemic process of
            industrialized ideological reproduction. It's hard to credit
            people
            working in such a mindless system with any semblance of
            authorship.
            They slavishly produce what they are under contract to
            produce within
            the ideological narrative framework preferred by their
            employer. Real
            responsibility for the false and deceitful material
            published by the
            Observer lies with its management, who could hardly care
            less.
