      <br>
The US government and its international and regional allies view real
autonomy and independence for Caribbean nations and for Central and
South American countries as a threat. The US government response has
been to militarize Latin America and the Caribbean with new bases,
principally in Panama and Colombia. Now, President Obama's
administration has exploited the catastrophe in Haiti to militarize
that country under the pretext of providing security for humanitarian
relief operations.<br>
      <br>
Governments in the region see straight through that pretext to the
menace behind it. Within Haiti, the US military occupation enables the
US government to suppress any resurgence of the virtually banned, but
widely popular, Fanmi Lavalas political movement, Haiti's largest. It
also makes less likely a return from his involuntary sojourn in South
Africa by Fanmi Lavalas leader, the exiled ex-President Jean Bertrand
Aristide. <br>
      <br>
Cuban and Venezuelan support for vital medical, education and other
development cooperation programmes in Haiti puts US government aid to
shame. The US occupation is likely to hinder Cuban and Venezuelan
development cooperation to Haiti. It also gives the US government
another base from which to menace Cuba and Venezuela while warning off
other countries in the region anxious to benefit from extremely
successful Venezuelan-led development cooperation programmes like
Petrocaribe or ALBA (the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas).<br>
      <br>
History the corporate media cover up<br>
      <br>
Much comment on the terrifying catastrophe in Port-au-Prince has
referred in passing to Haiti's history. Virtually no reports mention
that the United States occupied Haiti for almost 20 years between 1915
and 1934. From 1917 to 1919, patriotic Haitians in the north of the
country&nbsp; resisted the US occupation under the determined
leadership of Charlemagne Péralte. Back then, Peralte wrote,<br>
      <br>
&#8220;For four years the [American] Occupation has been insulting us
constantly. Each morning it brings us a new offense. The people are
poor and the Occupation still oppresses us with taxes.......Let&#8217;s get
rid of those savage people, whose beastly character is evident in the
person of their President Wilson&#8212;traitor, bandit, trouble maker, and
thief.&#8221;(1)<br>
      <br>
Péralte was killed when he was betrayed to a US Marines murder squad.
With the US government's latest military takeover of Haiti, President
Obama follows in the footsteps of President Woodrow Wilson, also a
Nobel prize winner. Like the Honduran military coup, Haiti's recent
history is a solid refutation of the big lie that the US government
promotes democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean. <br>
      <br>
In the national elections scheduled for early 2011, as in past
elections, the Haitian authorities, have deliberately blocked the
participation of Fanmi Lavalas. The US government and its allies are
also determined not to allow President Aristide to return from the
exile imposed by them during the 2004 coup.&nbsp; President Aristide
was kidnapped by US military and dumped in the Central African Republic
before finding refuge in South Africa. <br>
      <br>
Western Bloc countries &#8211; the US, Canada, the European Union and its
Pacific allies - deliberately drove Haiti and its people down into the
privatized neo-liberal dirt. Now those rich countries' leading
politicians lament the Haitian government's inability to respond to the
disastrous earthquake. One wonders what they expected. A report by US
writer Greg Palast noted that in all of Haiti &#8211; a country of around 10
million people &#8211; there were only two fire stations.<br>
      <br>
Rampant US crony corruption<br>
      <br>
People in the US might well look long and hard at what has happened in
Haiti. A wealthy, mediocre, corrupt, greedy oligarchy leeched the
country for all it was worth, facilitated the destruction of its
environment and abandoned the great majority of the population to
economic indigence and political impotence. The same process is well
under way in the United States. <br>
      <br>
Nothing could be clearer after the systematic betrayal of the majority
of people in the US by the gang of plutocrat grifters who have
sacrificed a productive US economy in favour of its elite financial
sector. Consider the fate of Federal Accounting Standards Board Rule
140. Originally scheduled to take effect in July 2008, it was meant to
force transparency on too-big-to-fail banks by bringing onto their
books multi-billion dollar losses hidden away &#8211; Enron style -&nbsp; in
off-shore special purpose investment vehicles. <br>
      <br>
In 2008, Rule 140's implementation was postponed until November 2009.
Now the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is caught up in a deal
proposing that the FASB's Rule 140 be postponed again, possibly for
years. Bloomberg on December 15th 2009 reported: <br>
      <br>
&#8220;Executives from Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo
&amp; Co., Capital One Financial Corp. and the American Securitization
Forum met FDIC officials Dec. 2 to discuss capital requirements related
to the FASB measure. <br>
      <br>
The executives proposed that &#8220;the transition period should extend
beyond 2010 to a point in the economy where unemployment is lower and
issuers are less capital-restrained from growing their balance sheet
and providing credit,&#8221; according to a paper the ASF presented the
FDIC.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
The too-big-to-fail Wall Street Banks are insolvent. They do not have
sufficient reserves to pay liabilities hidden away in mark-to-model
junk, much of which they swapped with the Federal Reserve, and also in
their off-shore special purpose entities. Even a cursory glance at the
Federal Reserve balance sheet is enough to show this up. <br>
      <br>
At December 31st 2009, the Federal Reserve had over US$900bn of
mortgage backed securities on its books, and US$88bn of preferred
interests in Bear Stearns/AIG bailout spin-offs. Those assets are
actually worth a fraction of their bogus mark-to-model valuations
dreamt up by creative accountants and dodgy auditors. The Federal
Reserve balance sheet does not give a true and fair view of the US
Central Bank's finances. <br>
      <br>
All this comes after government sponsored entities Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac have taken on mortgages and mortgage backed securities
nominally valued at billions of dollars, many in fact worth a few tens
of cents on the dollar. Similarly, the US Treasury and the Federal
Reserve made it possible for too-big-to-fail banks to recoup losses
from the American International Group at 100 cents on the dollar &#8211; far
in excess of their true value. Amazingly, in that context, plenty of
economists &#8211; even progressive economists &#8211; have publicly agreed with
Dick Cheney's idiotic remark that &#8220;Reagan proved deficits don't
matter&#8221;. <br>
      <br>
This consensus has fomented a policy climate tolerating unjustifiable
bail-outs benefiting a bankrupt, crooked finance sector so as to blow
up yet more speculative bubbles. It is only a matter of time before the
next crony casino-capitalist crisis again crashes a finance-skewed
system that fails to produce wealth for the United States people, let
alone allocate it appropriately. The latest Obama-Volcker froth about
&#8220;taking on the banks&#8221; - the very banks that bought Obama his Presidency
- will quickly evaporate in Washington's corrupt corporate-owned
hot-house legislature.<br>
      <br>
The US,&nbsp; Haiti and Nicaragua<br>
      <br>
Back in January 2008, AP reporter Jonathan Katz wrote of Haiti,&nbsp;
"...in places like Cite Soleil, the oceanside slum where Charlene
shares a two-room house with her baby, five siblings and two unemployed
parents, cookies made of dirt, salt and vegetable shortening have
become a regular meal..."When my mother does not cook anything, I have
to eat them three times a day," Charlene said.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Eating dirt is where the too-big-to-fail elite and their political
cronies are driving the people of the United States. The only
difference between Haiti's corrupt ruling class and that of the United
States is the scale of the resources they have wasted. They share
exactly the same mentality.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua has narrowly managed to escape Haiti's fate. The country's
corrupt oligarchy tried for 16 years to sink Nicaragua's people into
hopelessness very similar to that endured by the people of Haiti.
Western Bloc governments &#8211; of the US and Canada, the European Union and
their Pacific allies &#8211; approved, oversaw and facilitated that social
and economic debacle. They imposed privatization of vital public
resources, suppression of domestic agricultural production, cuts in
education and health care and deregulation in favour of rapacious,
environmentally destructive foreign investors.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;Just in time, after taking office in January 2007, Nicaragua's
FSLN government confronted the failure of that model and turned
Nicaragua's economy around. Under President Daniel Ortega, domestic
agricultural production and exports have reached record levels while
his government has simultaneously funded free education and health
care. Nicaragua's economy coped with the global economic crisis better
than other countries'. <br>
      <br>
It did so through astute coordination of private sector capacity and
public sector spending judiciously distributed between social spending,
infrastructure investment and support for small and medium-sized
businesses. Contradicting the stupid, barbaric neoliberal consensus,
Nicaragua's government prioritized agricultural production,
dramatically improving food security and winning new export markets. <br>
      <br>
Without doubt, access to resources from the ALBA regional economic and
development cooperation bloc greatly increased Nicaragua's options.
Greater policy choices made possible by ALBA portend greater
independence for countries formerly dominated by the United States.
That is why the US government facilitated the military coup and the
subsequent electoral farce in Honduras. It is why the US military is
occupying Haiti. <br>
      <br>
Having crushed democratic politics in Haiti and in Honduras, the
continuing regional deployment of US military resources demonstrates
that President Obama intends to keep things that way. ALBA governments
like those in Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela have made
significant progress on behalf of their peoples by rejecting US
economic and diplomatic bullying. Now, more than ever, they are targets
of the corrupt, failed-state US gangster plutocracy and its Western
Bloc cronies.<br>
