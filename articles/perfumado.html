            <br>
            One fundamental reason underlies the success of Nicaragua's
            Sandinista government. It can be seen in any comparison of
            the situation of the Nicaraguan people with that of the
            peoples of Europe or North America. In those countries no
            political force exists able to defend the majority against
            the ruthless assault against them by their countries' ruling
            elites. By contrast, in Nicaragua the Sandinista Front for
            National Liberation is a genuine and powerful political
            expression of the interests of the country's impoverished
            majority.<br>
            <br>
            Two basic aspects of its historical program have enabled the
            FSLN to divide and confound the opposition elites and those
            elites' foreign sponsors. Firstly, the democratization of
            the country's politics and economy has won support and
            acceptance among very broad sectors of the population, both
            among the very poor and, too, among the business classes.
            Secondly, the diversification of Nicaragua's foreign
            relations has ensured international political and economic
            support for the FSLN government unequalled since the first
            Sandinista revolutionary government of the 1980s.<br>
            <br>
            This reality has developed steadily and inexorably since
            President Daniel Ortega's inauguration&nbsp; in January
            2007. The unquestionable emergence of this reality explains
            the huge electoral advantage of the FSLN in these last two
            months before the national elections in November. It also
            explains the desperation of the political opposition, their
            pathetic discord and division and their lack of a credible
            political programme. In large measure, it has been the news
            media and the non governmental sector that have represented
            effective political opposition in the country.<br>
            <br>
            But the negative anti-Sandinista message of those two
            sectors has not met with general acceptance in Nicaragua. It
            has had more impact overseas, especially in the Western Bloc
            member countries of NATO. This fact reflects two very
            important things. It shows that Nicaragua is the subject of
            a psychological warfare offensive designed by the dominant
            elites in NATO member countries who sub-contract propaganda
            chores to Nicaragua's local news media and NGOs. As a
            corollary it also shows that Nicaragua is a key target&nbsp;
            in the NATO countries' increasing aggression against
            processes of change taking place in Latin America and the
            world in general.<br>
            <br>
            In Nicaragua, people are accustomed to the cynicism and
            hypocrisy of the opposition non-governmental sector made up
            almost entirely of proxy organizations supported by funds
            from NATO countries, for example, the Nicaragua Centre for
            Human Rights, Ethics and Transparency, the Autonomous Womens
            Movement, the Civil Coordinator group or the Movement for
            Nicaragua, among many others. Nor are people in Nicaragua
            surprised by the constant gross untruths appearing in the
            countries two main national newspapers, La Prensa and El
            Nuevo Diario. These are two tentacles of the oligarchic
            Chamorro family's monopolistic media-squid suffocating
            Nicaragua's intellectual life.<br>
            <br>
            The Chamorro family media-squid also flails at the
            Sandinista government with a non-governmental political
            propaganda tentacle called the Centre for Communications
            Research (CINCO). Like all the other Nicaraguan opposition
            NGOs, CINCO is funded by foreign organizations controlled by
            the NATO country elites. This reality reflects the
            dependence of the Nicaraguan opposition on foreign support,
            both financial and intellectual. A sinister and persistent
            characteristic of the opposition propaganda has been the
            repeated allusion by opposition figures like Antonio Lacayo,
            Henry Ruiz or Dora Maria Tellez to a possible recourse to
            armed violence. Those allusions currently call to mind the
            results of NATO's criminal interventions in Libya and Syria.<br>
            <br>
            A review of the offensive strategy of Nicaragua's political
            opposition is necessary in order to understand their moral
            and intellectual bankruptcy. The opinion polls indicate that
            inside Nicaragua this strategy has failed ignominiously.
            They show the FSLN and its candidate Daniel Ortega have a
            huge advantage over their nearest rival. By contrast, NATO
            country corporate media exaggerate the standing of the
            opposition and understate the support for the FSLN. They
            have done the same in Libya and Syria. They do so when
            reporting on any of the ALBA countries. It is a routine
            component of NATO's psychological warfare against countries
            that resist the demands of the Western Bloc elites.<br>
            <br>
            Failed opposition offensives<br>
            <br>
            When Daniel Ortega took office in January 2007, it took the
            Nicaraguan opposition several months to build a plausible
            offensive strategy. The attacks developed from the right and
            centre-right, from social democrats and from the ultra-Left.
            All the attacks set out to question the competence, honesty
            and transparency of government Ministers and the judicial
            system.<br>
            <br>
            As time went on, the attacks were also directed against the
            electoral authority. Another line of attack from the
            ultra-Left and the social democrat non governmental sector
            has been on the issue of therapeutic abortion. All these
            attack strategies intensified greatly during 2008, which, in
            November of that year, saw local government elections in
            Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            There was a clear convergence between the extreme-right, the
            centre right, the social democrats and the ultra-Left. The
            opposition political parties had a majority in the National
            Assembly. Opposition deputies thought they would be able to
            undermine and sabotage the Sandinista government's
            legislative programme by means of prolonged boycotts of the
            legislature's work.<br>
            <br>
            Former Sandinistas among the social democrats and the
            ultra-Left used sinister slogans like &#8220;Ortega and Somoza are
            the same thing&#8221; or &#8220;Rigoberto's coming...&#8221; referring to the
            assassination of the dictator Anastasio Somoza. The right
            wing and centre-right political parties started calling
            themselves the &#8220;democratic opposition&#8221;. Despite all this
            propaganda, already in 2008 the government's poverty
            reduction programmes were beginning to have an impact.
            Exports increased dramatically. Ordinary people began to
            recognize improvements to the public health and education
            systems and in broader availability of affordable credit for
            small and medium sized businesses<br>
            <br>
            Opposition failure internationally<br>
            <br>
            The growing acceptance and approval of government policies
            among the Nicaraguan population&nbsp; forced the opposition
            to dig in and deepen an ever more negative campaign based on
            fear. The opposition's insistence on an alleged
            &#8220;dictatorship&#8221; being imposed by the Sandinista government
            came to sound more and more hysterical. At the end of 2008
            the international crisis seemed to have come to the aid of
            the floundering opposition.<br>
            <br>
            That international economic crisis imposed very difficult
            conditions for the implementation of the government's
            programmes. In an effort to take advantage of that situation
            anti-patriotic politicians like Eduardo Montealegre and his
            social democrat allies chose to collaborate with the United
            States government and the European Union. They urged those
            foreign authorities&nbsp; - against the interests of their
            own Nicaraguan people &#8211; to cut development cooperation aid
            to Nicaragua so as to put pressure on the Sandinista
            government.<br>
            <br>
            The US government and the European Union quickly cut a total
            of more than US$100 million in development cooperation
            funds. Almost equally rapidly that funding was replaced with
            funds from ALBA's development cooperation structures. For
            that reason, during this period the Nicaraguan opposition
            intensified their attacks on the use of Venezuela's
            development funding within the ALBA trade and development
            cooperation framework.<br>
            <br>
            These attacks have served as an index of the Nicaraguan
            opposition's frustration. They could see the programme of
            the Sandinista government progressing despite the
            international economic crisis and the cuts in foreign
            development cooperation funding by the imperialist powers.
            ALBA not only helped the government of President Daniel
            Ortega to survive the regional impact of the international
            economic crisis, but to overcome it.<br>
            <br>
            The Sandinista government continued its extensive programme
            of infrastructure improvements. It managed to sustain a
            continuous increase in exports. Likewise, it deepened the
            reduction in levels of extreme poverty in the country.
            Similarly, during a period which saw the fascist coup in
            Honduras, the diversification of Nicaragua's foreign
            relations under Daniel Ortega's leadership was also decisive
            for the country's stability.<br>
            <br>
            Through 2010,the credibility of the main components of the
            Nicaragua political opposition's campaign against the
            Sandinista government suffered irreversible damage. One
            setback was the firm response of the government to the Costa
            Rican government's unwonted aggression towards the end of
            2010. Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla and her
            ministers claimed Nicaraguan territory at the delta of the
            Rio San Juan to be part of Costa Rica.<br>
            <br>
            The steadfast defence of the government against that claim
            received total support nationally. At an international
            level, the FSLN government undercut the Costa Rican
            government's offensive in the Organization of American
            States by taking the case directly to the International
            Court of Justice. At the same time, Nicaragua's exceptional
            economic growth of 4.5% during 2010 won the approval of
            international financial institutions, most importantly the
            International Monetary Fund.<br>
            <br>
            Internal failure, foreign irrelevance<br>
            <br>
            One by one the opposition attacks inside Nicaragua have
            failed. Their persistent boycotts of the legislative work of
            the National Assembly failed. The FSLN reached agreement
            with a sufficient number of deputies to maintain a working
            quorum in the legislature. <br>
            <br>
            At the end of 2009 the opposition also tried in vain to
            sabotage the proceedings of the Constitutional Division of
            the Supreme Court of Justice. The magistrates of the
            Constitutional division had to decide on the right to
            re-election of President Daniel Ortega and over 100
            municipal mayors. In the end, the ruling &#8211; admitting the
            constitutional right of all Nicaraguan citizens to
            re-election- was made with the deputy magistrates of absent
            opposition magistrates. The ruling was subsequently fully -
            and quietly -&nbsp; ratified by the opposition aligned
            magistrates themselves.<br>
            <br>
            Later, at the start of 2010, the opposition deputies refused
            to comply with their constitutional obligation to
            elect&nbsp; new authorities for the different powers of
            State. To avoid institutional chaos, President Ortega issued
            a decree prolonging the periods of office of the relevant
            officials. Following standard practice in many European and
            Latin American countries, the decree remains valid until the
            National Assembly does in fact elect new authorities to the
            respective posts of the different powers of State. <br>
            <br>
            Outside Nicaragua, the whole NATO non-governmental, media
            and government apparatus has mobilized around these failed
            propaganda themes of the Nicaraguan opposition &#8211; re-election
            and the extension of the periods of office of official in
            the various powers of State. Internally this strategy has
            failed hopelessly. Opinion polls on voting intentions show
            that as the number of don't knows diminishes voting
            intentions in favour of the FSLN rise proportionately.<br>
            <br>
            In fact, four main propaganda themes have been used by the
            opposition who allege:<br>
            <br>
            President Daniel Ortega's re-election is unconstitutional<br>
            the judiciary and the electoral authorities are de facto and
            corrupt<br>
            ALBA development cooperation funds are corruptly abused<br>
            the Sandinista government violates the rights of women<br>
            <br>
            The categorical and dramatic increase in support for the
            FSLN demonstrates that these arguments only convince a
            diminishing minority of Nicaraguans. Even overseas, the
            unquestionable domestic popular support for President Daniel
            Ortega's government makes it harder and harder for the NATO
            countries' psychological warfare operatives to maintain the
            credibility of their blatant falsehoods.<br>
            <br>
            In his essay &#8220;Homage to Catalonia&#8221;, George Orwell wrote,
            &#8220;The truth goes on existing, as it were, behind one's back.&#8221;
            This is the reality against which the cynical and
            hypocritical political opposition in Nicaragua have crashed.
            The arguments around the issue of therapeutic abortion offer
            a very clear example.<br>
            <br>
            The issue is one that worries a great many people outside
            Nicaragua but it is not a priority for the great majority of
            people inside Nicaragua. As in other countries, there are
            strong differences of opinion about whether the law on
            abortion in Nicaragua is appropriate or right. What cannot
            be denied is that, for better or worse, the great majority
            of the population is not concerned enough to change it.<br>
            <br>
            One can speculate about why that should be. In part, it is
            because the government has made a great effort to reduce
            maternal mortality. This indicates that while women may have
            no explicit right to&nbsp; abortion, nonetheless doctors can
            act to protect the life of a mother at serious risk from her
            pregnancy.<br>
            <br>
            This is the reason why the exaggerated predictions of the
            Nicaraguan pro-choice women's movement have turned out to be
            wrong. There has been been a fall in maternal mortality
            since the law was changed back in 2006. It is in that
            context that the non governmental sector in Nicaragua has
            campaigned overseas to get support from foreign
            organizations. <br>
            <br>
            Of these, the most recent to address the matter has been
            Amnesty International. But neither Amnesty International nor
            any of the various foreign organizations addressing the
            matter have dealt with it as a regional issue. That would
            have meant attacking the relevant legislation in El Salvador
            and Chile and extremely restrictive legislation in other
            countries too. <br>
            <br>
            The attacks on the issue have been specifically aimed at the
            Sandinista government in Nicaragua.&nbsp; By dealing with
            the issue in that way, relying on foreign support, the
            Nicaraguan women's organizations campaigning for abortion
            rights have distanced themselves from national domestic
            opinion. Theat dependence on foreign resources and ideas by
            the anti-Sandinista Nicaraguan women's movement has shown
            its leaders' cynicism, hypocrisy and ineptitude.<br>
            <br>
            For example, the Autonomous Women's Movement (MAM) have
            publicly validated the presidential candidacy of Fabio
            Gadea. But Fabio Gadea is a candidate who has vigorously
            declared himself Pro-Life &#8211; the loaded codeword for
            anti-abortion &#8211; diametrically opposed to MAM's
            demands.&nbsp; This cynicism and hypocrisy makes impossible
            any move towards a common understanding with Sandinista
            women who are also opposed to the abortion law in Nicaragua
            as it currently stands.<br>
            <br>
            The political opposition deepen their estrangement from the
            feelings and experience of the majority in Nicaragua when
            they refuse to acknowledge the great advances made for
            women's rights under the Sandinista government. Political
            representation for women within the FSLN is 50-50, far
            greater than in the opposition political parties. Women
            occupy around 40% of senior government posts. <br>
            <br>
            Government programmes have persistently prioritized women in
            terms of access to credit. Women have been prioritized in
            the areas of land titling and the formation of cooperatives
            and small and medium sized businesses. For these and many
            more reasons, opposition arguments around the theme of
            women's rights in Nicaragua convince no significant body of
            national opinion on the issue.<br>
            <br>
            The final throw : cry fraud, create chaos<br>
            <br>
            With their arguments and self-dramatization rejected by the
            great majority of people in Nicaragua, the opposition
            political parties, along with their media and NGO allies,
            have decided to rely on vociferous accusations of electoral
            fraud. In fact, opposition leaders have nurtured this option
            since their failed campaign to discredit the municipal
            elections of 2008. They were never able to demonstrate their
            accusations then, nor are they able now in 2011 to justify
            their ridiculous claims of pre-arranged systematic fraud in
            the run up to the national elections in November.<br>
            <br>
            Among their arguments claiming fraud, they allege that the
            issuing of national ID cards &#8211; c&eacute;dulas &#8211; has been
            deliberately manipulated to favour Sandinista voters. They
            suggest that somehow the issuing officials can sixth-sense
            who is likely to vote Sandinista or not. In fact, the
            validity of even expired c&eacute;dulas was extended earlier
            this year, by a vote in the National Assembly, to December
            2012. Even citizens who for one or other reason have no
            c&eacute;dula at all will be able to vote by getting what
            the authorities call a supplementary voting document. The
            only eligible voters not to cast their vote in November will
            be people who have no intention of voting anyway. <br>
            <br>
            Another argument of the Nicaraguan opposition is that
            electoral observation will be restricted and manipulated.
            But the electoral observation rules, issued on August 16th,
            establish clear and simple norms for both national and
            international observers. Observers who satisfy the
            accreditation prerequisites are required to respect the
            authority of country's electoral body and other
            institutions, like the police and the army, ensured with
            guaranteeing a successful electoral process. Even so, the
            opposition insistently repeating their irrational
            allegations of pre-arranged fraud. Individuals like former
            Sandinista Henry Ruiz have even threatened to forcibly
            occupy municipal electoral offices.<br>
            <br>
            Ever since 2007, opposition representatives have alluded to
            the threat of violence as their last recourse in order to
            remove Daniel Ortega from office. Extreme right-wing
            politicians like Enrique Qui&ntilde;onez, on various
            occasions, have provoked very serious incidents of armed
            violence. In the latest, a Qui&ntilde;onez bodyguard shot
            and wounded an innocent bystander, possibly leaving the
            young victim paralysed for life. After the 2008 municipal
            elections, perennial failed candidate, Eduardo Montealegre,
            deliberately urged his supporters to stage widespread
            vicious street violence, which he then blamed on the
            Sandinistas.<br>
            <br>
            So it is an open question what may happen in the last few
            weeks prior to the national elections in November. The
            venomous personal hatred of Edmundo Jarquin's circle for
            Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo is notorious. Corrupt
            individuals like Eduardo Montealegre and violent thugs like
            Enrique Qui&ntilde;onez &#8211; both of whom hide behind the
            immunity from prosecution they enjoy as legislators &#8211; are
            desperate to slake their thirst for power and to satisfy
            their corporate and international backers.<br>
            <br>
            They incarnate the very same negative characteristics they
            themselves falsely project onto the person of Daniel Ortega.
            In fact, the principal characteristic of President Ortega is
            his contact and empathy with the country's impoverished
            majority. It is a characteristic none of the opposition
            leaders understand or possess &#8211; with the possible exception
            of disgraced former president Arnoldo Aleman.<br>
            <br>
            On not being &#8220;perfumado&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            The term &#8220;perfumado&#8221; probably gained widest notoriety during
            the presidencies of Carlos Salinas and Ernesto Zedillo in
            Mexico. They and their circles preened themselves on their
            supposed intellectual and managerial superiority. They made
            up an elite completely out of touch with the needs of
            Mexico's impoverished majority. For them, ordinary people
            were no more than an electoral mass to be moulded and
            exploited whenever an election came around. The political
            opposition in Nicaragua have the same mentality.<br>
            <br>
            As a term of ridicule &#8220;perfumado&#8221; has spread to mean any
            closed circle of people who think themselves superior to
            everyone else. A typical expression of that mentality occurs
            in Honduras. There, the ruling elite deprecate what they
            call the &#8220;chusma&#8221;, the impoverished majority whom they
            regard as little more than a regrettable necessity to
            satisfy their need for cheap labour. When the &#8220;chusma&#8221; rise
            up&nbsp; to demand fundamental rights, they are repressed
            and murdered as has happened horrifically in the Bajo Aguan
            area in northern Honduras since the 2009 coup.<br>
            <br>
            In Nicaragua, varieties of &#8220;perfumado&#8221; abound. Individuals
            like Eduardo Montealegre and Edmundo Jarqu&iacute;n,
            irredeemably identified with Nicaragua's oligarchy, seem to
            think they have a divine right to govern thanks simply to
            who they are. On the other hand, individuals like Dora Maria
            Tellez, Sofia Montenegro and Vilma Nu&ntilde;ez de Escorcia
            pride themselves on their putative, notional moral
            superiority to their Sandinista opponents.<br>
            <br>
            What all the different varieties of &#8220;perfumados&#8221; have in
            common is that they lack credibility among the great
            majority of ordinary people. Few people have any faith in
            them because their arguments contradict what most people
            experience on a daily basis. The Nicaraguan opposition
            project a totally unconvincing here-comes-the-bogeyman
            reality of fantasy and blatant deceit. By contrast,
            President Ortega has convinced the great majority of people
            in Nicaragua that his leadership is practical, modest and
            sincere.<br>
            <br>
            Despite many difficulties, the FSLN government has delivered
            on its 2006 electoral campaign promises. Its participatory
            model of Citizens' Power, patchy and imperfect but without
            sectarian political distinctions, has enabled the FSLN to
            take the pulse of what ordinary people want and need.
            Despite the inevitable contradictions along the way,
            President Ortega and Rosario Murillo and their colleagues
            have strengthened the relation of the FSLN to their popular
            base throughout Nicaragua and extended support among sectors
            previously hostile to Sandinista ideas.<br>
            <br>
            Few doubt that Daniel Ortega, Rosario Murillo, their
            Sandinista colleagues and their coalition allies will win a
            well deserved electoral victory on November 6th. For their
            part, the Nicaraguan opposition run the risk of suffering a
            historic political and electoral defeat that may see them
            lose control of the National Assembly for the first time
            since 1990. Right now, it is impossible to see how they can
            reverse the trend among Nicaraguan voters in favour of the
            FSLN, a trend that will almost certainly increase in the
            remaining weeks before the election.<br>
