Wage
Negotiations :<br>Can the
government do anything to better the workers' lot?<br>
<br>
by Karla Jacobs, August 20th 2008</div>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In
light of the current minimum wage negotiations, Tortilla con Sal takes
a closer look at economic and other factors likely to influence the
negotiations. It is also interesting to examine the government's
response, over the last eighteen months, to the scourge of starvation
wages and the very unequal balance of power between business elites and
their impoverished workers.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
In June 2007 FSLN deputies managed to push the new Minimum Wage Law
(Law 625) through the National Assembly without permitting substantial
modification by the opposition. This was a much needed piece of
legislation which, in theory at least, sets the foundations for a
regulated and functional procedure by which to establish the rate of
the minimum wage. The <a href="http://legislacion.asamblea.gob.ni/Normaweb.nsf/%28$All%29/D4A4AB6A3935BB7906257331005B6D2C?OpenDocument">
"fundamental objective" of the law is to put into
practice Article 82 of the Nicaraguan constitution which states that
"workers have the right to a salary which permits a state of wellbeing
compatible with human dignity."</a> <br>
<br>
The law created the National Minimum Wage Commission which is made up
of representatives of workers unions, the private sector and the
Ministry of Labor (MITRAB). This commission is required to meet every
six months to discuss appropriate adjustments to the minimum wage.
During the twice yearly negotiations the Commission is instructed to
take into account not just the cost of the <span style="font-style: italic;">canasta básica</span> (see Note) and
economic factors such as inflation and productivity, but also "the
highest salaries paid by the state." The FSLN government's effort to
bring public official's salaries down to the level of private formal
sector salaries is demonstrated in the graph below.<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><a>During
previous
governments the mega salaries earned by some of
Nicaragua's public officials had reached exorbitant levels. In a recent
interview with TcS, Treasury Minister Alberto Guevara asserted that
some top public officials in the previous Bolaños had been paid as much
as US$30,000 a month. Shortly after his return to power President
Daniel Ortega brought an end to government officials' mega salaries,
freeing up tens of thousands of dollars for social spending.<br>
<br>
This move was part of the government's overall effort to reduce the gap
between the rich elite and the impoverished majority as was the
instruction to consider the "highest public sector salaries&#8221; during
minimum wage negotiations. Perhaps the most important aspect of law 625
is the orientation for the National Minimum Wage Committee to "review
and reform" the <span style="font-style: italic;">canasta básica</span> "so as to provide 100% of the
nutritional needs" of a family of six as established by the Institution
of Nutrition of Central American and Panama (INCAP) and other
institutions specializing in nutrition.<br>
<br>
After two months of consultation and negotiations the Commission
revised the <span style="font-style: italic;">canasta básica</span> in August 2007, introducing substantial
increases in both the quantity and the quality of food products,
household goods, basic services and clothing included in the basket. As
a result </a><a href="http://www.bcn.gob.ni/estadisticas/indicadores/2-13.htm">the
cost of the <span style="font-style: italic;">canasta básica</span> shot up</a> from C$3,254.6 in
August 2007 to C$7,217.3 in September 2007. This change was
welcomed by unions. It provides them with a more convincing tool with
which to demand significant pay rises for their workers. It also puts a certain amount of moral pressure on employers by
transforming society's perception of a basic standard of living. <br><br>So far
during Ortega's administration the average minimum wage has experienced
a nominal increase of 33% (18% in 2007, 15% in January 2008). According
to Roberto Gonzalez, leader of the Sandinista Workers' Central, this is
the highest percentage increase to minimum wages since the 1980s. In
real terms, however, the value of workers' salaries has fallen steadily
since November 2005, as can be observed in the graph below. <br>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This
steady fall
is
due to inflation caused mainly by
external
factors, namely the devaluation of the US dollar and volatile oil
price rises. The FSLN government's efforts to keep down basic food
and public transport prices have reduced the impact of the
international financial crisis. These efforts, made possible by
Nicaragua's participation in ALBA (the Bolivarian Alternative for the
America's), put Nicaraguan workers in a better position than their
counterparts in other Central American countries.<br>
<br>
The perception among
the population that basic goods are
more
expensive than ever persists, however, despite food prices in
Nicaragua being lower than those in the rest of the region, where
salaries tend to be higher. So workers still feel the FSLN
government is not doing enough to maintain or increase the value of
their salaries. During the current round of minimum wage negotiations
the majority of unions are calling for a 53% pay rise based on the
logic that two working adults should together be able to cover 100%
of the <i>canasta básica</i>. <br>
<br>
The only differing
union proposal is that of the
Confederatión
Sandinista de Trabajadores for a 25% pay rise alongside proposed
agreements with the government for a housing project to benefit
10,000 free trade zone workers and increased coverage of the
government's subsidized food programs. CST leader Roberto Gonzalez
says "obviously" workers want their salaries to cover the
cost of the <span style="font-style: italic;">canasta básica</span>, but "it is very difficult to convince
the private sector to allow for that." <br><br>The employers'
organization the Consejo Superior de la Empresa Privada, the largest
private sector association, proposes an average 11.29% average pay
rise. COSEP's president
Jose Aguerri explained that this
proposal is
based on the inflation registered during the first semester of the
year (11.79%) plus economic growth (which was negative for some
sectors). COSEP negotiators described the unions' 53% proposal as
"totally unrealistic," warning that any increase above
inflation plus economic growth would create widespread unemployment
and stunt the national economy. <br><br>The Frente Nacional de Trabajadores
representative Luis Barbosa, meanwhile, described COSEP's proposal as
"not serious" and "irresponsible." He went on to
challenge COSEP and other big business
representatives to publicize their accounts with details of annual
profits. COSEP negotiator Mario Zelaya said Barbosa's suggestion
would not be considered arguing that a business' profits are a
"private affair." <br><br>The Minimum Wage Commission will meet
again on August 14 when Labor Minister Chavez is expected to present
the government's proposal. According to MITRAB negotiator Ivan Acosta
the government is aiming for a proposal which will "guarantee
economic harmony," is "satisfactory for all sectors
involved, does not provoke redundancies and is agreed upon between
the government, workers unions and the private sector."<br>
<br>
During both rounds
of negotiations of the National
Minimum Wage
Commission last year, COSEP ended up abandoning the negotiating table
arguing that the government did not take private sector proposals
into account. On both occasions (in May 2007 and January 2008),
however, the final percentage increase was almost exactly half way
between the final proposals presented by both sides. <br><br>Private
enterprise in Nicaragua is aware that it is only just beginning to
feel the crunch of the US recession. Considering the
increasingly adverse international
financial
context COSEP's previously expressed disappointment with the
government's handling of minimum wage negotiations could well be
converted into outright financial or political threats this time
round.<br><br>Given the importance of the working relationship the FSLN
government has enjoyed with COSEP and other private sector
associations until now in terms of overall stability within the
country, it seems unlikely that the government would feel able to
approve a pay rise higher than the 18% registered at the beginning of
the year.<br>
<br>
On the other hand
the government has to be seen to be
sensitive to
the desperate financial situation of Nicaraguan workers, who during
the first four months of the year earned on average just C$2,266 a
month, equivalent to a little over 20% of the <i>canasta básica.
</i>The upcoming local elections are a further complicating
factor in
the negotiations which must produce an agreement by September 24. <br>
