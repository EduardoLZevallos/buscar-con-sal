      <br>

Current efforts to secure an amnesty for corrupt Right wing political
leaders in Nicaragua are hugely embarrassing for international critics
and enemies of Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The record of
President Daniel Ortega's government makes the desperate counterfactual
claims of&nbsp; hostile media across the political spectrum look
ridiculous.&nbsp; The latest effort by&nbsp; leading Nicaraguan
right-wing politicians to evade justice for their crimes could hardly
demonstrate this more clearly. The FSLN has emerged stronger than ever from the failed opposition amnesty initiative.<br>

      <br>

The opposition-controlled Economic Commission in the legislature
initiated the attempted corruption amnesty after right wing opposition
legislators' failed in their efforts to provoke a constitutional crisis
over voting new authorities for the country's Supreme Court of Justice
and Supreme Electoral Council, among other posts. Daniel Ortega faced
down the unconstitutional right-wing challenge to procedural legitimacy
via a presidential decree. That decree confirmed current office holders
in their positions until such time as the National Assembly complies
with&nbsp; its constitutional duty.<br>

      <br>

Subsequently, right wing political leaders hoped to vote through the
unconstitutional amnesty&nbsp; for hundreds of former government
officials involved in a mountain of cases processed by the Controller
General's office under right wing governments&nbsp; over the last 16
years. (1) The amnesty's main beneficiaries would have been the US embassy's
perennial candidate Eduardo Montealegre and disgraced former President
Arnoldo Aleman. The opposition generated mini-crisis completely
destroyed all the absurd claims that Nicaragua is, or runs the risk of
becoming, a dictatorship under Daniel Ortega. In the event, the
opposition could not muster the minimum votes needed to vote through
their amnesty.<br>

      <br>
Influential Sandinista journalist William Grigsby points out that
commentators who lament the politicization of Nicaragua's legal system
are absolutely right. But, he observes, it is the right wing who have
politicized judicial process by consistently threatening the minority
Sandinista government with legislative boycotts in the National
Assembly.&nbsp; By doing so they extort concessions from the
government's legal officers in relation to the processing of corruption
cases involving opposition political leaders. The opposition leaders'
amnesty proposal was meant to exonerate them entirely so as to be able
to freely sabotage the Sandinista-led coalition government's
internationally recognized social and economic programmes which have
made the FSLN's overall government programme a model for the region.<br>

      <br>

The most recent judicial outrage facilitated by rogue judges under pressure
from the opposition was the exoneration of two of Arnoldo Aleman's
henchmen on corruption charges. Former Head of Nicaragua's Revenue
Office, Byron Jerez, and former Treasury Minister Esteban Duquestrada,
were both exonerated of egregious corruption offences following the
Supreme Court's similar exoneration in December 2008 of some of the
charges against Arnoldo Aleman. Other charges against Aleman remain
pending, as well as cases involving the notorious CENIS financial
operation under Presidents Alemán and Bolaños that cheated the
Nicaraguan taxpayer out of over US$300 million.<br>

      <br>

All these events demolish claims by United States and European Union
government representatives, generally given uncritical currency by
corporate and alternative media, such as :<br>

      <br>
* the Sandinista government is an undemocratic dictatorship<br>
* the Sandinista government controls the Nicaraguan justice system<br>
* the opposition political parties are the only trustworthy democratic forces in Nicaragua<br>

      <br>

All these false propositions have been repeated ad nauseam by almost
all the main international corporate and alternative media. Not a
single one of the politicians or political groups they have supported
emerges from the affair looking good. It has been the Sandinista-led
coalition government&nbsp; that has defended basic norms of good
governance and democratic procedure, as it has done from the day it
took office in January 2007.<br>

      <br>

The media darlings of the social democrat Movimiento Renovador
Sandinista groupuscule have suffered what looks like terminal damage as
a political force. Now reduced to just two deputies, the MRS has to
borrow deputies from the extreme right-wing group led by Eduardo
Montealegre in order to continue as an autonomous bloc in the
legislature. The MRS and former MRS member Monica Baltodano voted
solidly for three years with the same right wing politicians
responsible for cheating the Nicaraguan people out of over US$800m. At
least, that is the amount that can be proved in court. The true figure
may well be twice that.<br>

      <br>

Further evidence of the competence and integrity of the Sandinista
government came recently as a result of an audit of the State petroleum
company, Petronic and of the Institute of Social Security. Local
Nicaraguan media criticised both bodies constantly and aggressively all
through 2008 and 2009 accusing them of being egregiously corrupt. The
Comptroller-General's Audit demonstrated that apart from
recommendations for trivial technical improvements, no trace of
deliberate fraud was found. The news was totally buried by local,
regional and international corporate and alternative media. Of course
it was. It ran against those media's prewritten script.<br>

      <br>

The competence, integrity and political and economic success of
President Daniel Ortega's government make the Nicaraguan political
opposition and their backers in the United States, Canada and Europe
look like sinister idiots. Despite obvious, unsurprising practical
obstacles, contradictions and failings, the Nicaraguan government has
become a strategic regional model in Central America in terms of
participative democracy, poverty reduction and economic progress. It
has done so largely as a result of its membership of the Bolivarian
Alliance of the peoples of the Americas (ALBA), lead by Venezuela and
Cuba.<br>

      <br>

The neocolonial corporate and alternative media choke on this
unpalatable truth just like their governments do. In practice that
means that the huge social and economic advances made by the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua in just three years, since January 2007, go
unreported. The same is true of the massive regional impact of the ALBA
programmes and their associated energy and food security initiative
Petrocaribe. The challenge now facing Nicaragua and ALBA is to sustain
their categorical success despite continuing economic stagnation in the
US and Europe, which may well last for years into the coming decade.<br>
