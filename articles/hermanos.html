            <br>
            Unsconscious looking-glass resentment once made Richard
            Nixon's Chief of Staff Alexander Haig call British Foreign
            Secretary Lord Carrington a &#8220;duplicitous bastard&#8221;. The sick
            irony of Haig's petulant blart is that US foreign policy has
            always been one of deceitful cunning, evil mass-murder and
            global criminality, notoriously exemplified by President
            Nixon and Henry Kissinger. It continues unchanged with
            plutocrat-catamite Barack Obama. <br>
            <br>
            Svelte houseboy-President Obama rents out his
            duplicitous-bastard talents to help corrupt Western
            corporate elites and their allies pauperize their own
            peoples and plunder vulnerable countries like Libya. Obama
            sells his crimes as promoting democracy and prosperity. His
            weird-familiar Hillary Clinton and her depleted-uranium
            blasted-heath sisters, Samantha Power and Susan Rice,
            provide back up.<br>
            <br>
            These serial-child-killers try hard to outdo Bill Clinton
            and Madeleine Albright, who notoriously argued that 500,000
            needlessly dead Iraqi children represented &#8220;a price worth
            paying&#8221;.&nbsp; They work overtime to hubble-bubble,
            toil-and-trouble virtual pretexts for diplomatic, economic
            and military aggression against countries the Western
            political and corporate elites want to control. Once the
            supreme war crime is consummated, their financial,
            military-industrial and other corporate carpet-bagger
            partners move in. <br>
            <br>
            The New York Times' Scott Shane recently reported how
            Western multinational buzzard-corporations are now swooping
            on Libya while the country is still in conflict with its
            cities ruined and tens of thousands dead. Shane writes,
            &#8220;Entrepreneurs are abuzz about the business potential of a
            country with huge needs and the oil to pay for them, plus
            the competitive advantage of Libyan gratitude toward the
            United States and its NATO partners. A week before Colonel
            Qaddafi&#8217;s death on Oct. 20, a delegation from 80 French
            companies arrived in Tripoli to meet officials of the
            Transitional National Council, the interim government. Last
            week, the new British defense minister, Philip Hammond,
            urged British companies to &#8220;pack their suitcases&#8221; and head
            to Tripoli. &#8221;
(http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/world/africa/western-companies-see-libya-as-ripe-at-last-for-business.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=tha2)<br>
            <br>
            To brake their relative economic decline against China and
            other global competitors, the Western Bloc elites of North
            America and Europe have a brief window of opportunity,
            perhaps no more than a few years. For centuries, until now,
            without powerful military competitors, bar the Soviet Union
            for a while, their global war on humanity has never ceased.
            What is decisive about their war on Libya is that, more even
            than the war on Iraq, it signals the war of all against all.
            <br>
            <br>
            The categorical failure of the United Nations system makes
            fear of retaliation the only constraint on military
            aggression. Like Daladier and Chamberlain, who in 1938
            abandoned Czechosolvakia to Nazi Germany, Russia's and
            China's rulers abandoned Libya to appease the NATO
            countries' ruling corporate-militarist fascists. In doing
            so, they have only postponed the strategic confrontation
            with Western Bloc elites that must inevitably take place in
            some shape or form for control of limited global resources
            and contested areas of geopolitical interest. <br>
            <br>
            Lessons learned and re-learned<br>
            <br>
            Libya's expulsion from the UN Human Rights Council and the
            start of NATO's bombing campaign&nbsp; took place barely two
            months after publication of the UN Human Rights Council's
            Universal Periodic review. Then, in early January 2011,
            Libya's report was accepted by all and praised by many of
            the very nations, like Qatar and Jordan, that participated
            in NATO's onslaught just weeks later. Just as happened in
            Iraq, the evidence adduced to justify the destruction of
            Libya &#8211; in this case allegations of lethal military force
            against unarmed demonstrators - was completely false.<br>
            <br>
            NATO country governments, their media and non-governmental
            organizations all depicted the foreign-backed armed
            insurrection in Libya as a spontaneous peaceful protest. In
            fact, it was clearly a long-prepared putsch involving
            renegade government officials, islamic militants,
            foreign-based subversive groups and powerful local economic
            elites.&nbsp; Far from being a broadly-based popular
            uprising, the insurrection was a deeply reactionary coup,
            backed by NATO country governments, seeking to destroy the
            revolutionary redistributive system of the Libyan
            Jamahiriya.<br>
            <br>
            To sell that reactionary destruction of a system
            self-evidently enjoying majority popular support,
            international corporate media and non-governmental
            organizations used psychological warfare more blatantly than
            ever before. The accusations of Libyan government massacres
            were false. The absurd claim that Libyan troops were issued
            with Viagra to facilitate brutal campaigns of mass rape was
            false. <br>
            <br>
            Hysterical claims that African mercenaries were deployed to
            murder civilian protestors were also false. This wholesale
            mass deception reached its climax with international media
            broadcasts in August of fake footage ostensibly from Libya.
            In fact, the broadcasts used film shot in Qatar on sets made
            to look like Tripoli's Green Square.<br>
            <br>
            International media and non-governmental organizations of
            all kinds now work openly as politically motivated partners
            of NATO country governments. Like their international media
            counterparts, human rights organizations repeated as fact
            almost every accusation emanating from Libya's aggressors.
            They consistently exaggerated and distorted alleged
            violations by the authorities of the Libyan Jamahiriya. <br>
            <br>
            From the very start of the conflict in Libya, prestigious
            Western human rights organizations minimized or ignored
            massive human rights violations by the CNT renegades and
            their NATO masters. As the aggression against Libya's people
            progressed, the pro-NATO political alignment of supposedly
            neutral human rights and humanitarian organizations became
            undeniable. Their failure to condemn the bombing of Zliten,
            the massacres in Tripoli and NATO's merciless destruction of
            Sirte and Bani Walid have exhausted whatever moral authority
            Western NGOs may once have had. <br>
            <br>
            The United Nations Organization failed again to uphold its
            founding principles of non-aggression and self-determination
            of peoples. Its Human Rights Council has shown that it is
            incapable of resisting unscrupulous malevolent political
            manipulation. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon has operated
            on behalf of NATO even more blatantly than his predecessors,
            Boutros Boutros-Ghali or Kofi Annan, who readily
            collaborated in Western mass-murder, most egregiously in
            Iraq.<br>
            <br>
            The International Criminal Court is even more discredited as
            an impartial judicial instrument than it was before. The
            Court's indictment of Muammar Al Ghaddafi was based on
            ridiculously biased news reports and completely unverified
            accusations by avowed enemies of the Libyan Jamahiriya. The
            court's Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno Campo, made repeated
            mistaken announcements &#8211; about the Viagra accusations, about
            the detention of Saif Al Islam &#8211; which showed how
            incompetent and biased he and his staff are at the most
            basic bureaucratic level.<br>
            <br>
            The colonial practice of the International Criminal Court is
            a reminder of how the law and international legal practice
            have consistently been used as a crucial component of
            economic and psychological warfare by the West against its
            former colonies. The Libyan authorities &#8211; abbreviated by
            Western media to &#8220;Gaddhafi&#8221; - were falsely accused of the
            1987 Berlin disco bombing and the Lockerbie terrorist
            bombing. The most recent example of this kind of
            manipulation has been the Special Tribunal on Lebanon,
            rigged by NATO governments to further the regional agenda of
            Israel.<br>
            <br>
            The categorical and irremediable failure of the UN system
            has been matched by the loss of credibility of world powers
            and regional organizations. China and Russia have
            demonstrated their strategic&nbsp; weakness faced with
            determined NATO country military aggression. The stand they
            have taken, far too late, over Syria, is unlikely to prevent
            continuing foreign destabilization of that country or even
            future NATO or allied military aggression against either
            Syria and Iran or, in Latin America, against Venezuela.<br>
            <br>
            The Arab League has confirmed its subordination to the
            reactionary fundamentalist monarchy in Saudi Arabia. Iran
            and its regional allies Hezbollah and Hamas have confirmed
            their commitment to cynical, hypocritical regional
            realpolitik. By validating the war crimes of NATO and its
            allies in Libya, they have weakened denunciations of
            Israel's aggression and war crimes in Palestine and Lebanon.
            After rushing to recognize the Libyan renegades, Iran, a
            close ally of the Syrian government, has kept quiet about
            the renegade Libyan CNT's recognition of Syria's opposition
            CNT.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps the most disturbing sequel to Libya's destruction
            has been international endorsement of the murderous racist
            CNT renegades by over 100 governments as Libya's
            representative in the UN, in complete disregard of the UN's
            basic precept of racial equality. Over Libya, the African
            Union and its member countries were brazenly ignored and
            humiliated by the governments of the NATO countries and of
            the Arab League. With some few honourable exceptions, they
            have abased themselves in the most abject way by validating
            the actions and&nbsp; policies of Libya's openly racist,
            spurious CNT authorities.<br>
            <br>
            A footnote to the destruction of Libya has been the
            collaboration or collusion in that destruction of almost all
            the international progressive managerial class that controls
            intellectual production and distribution in Europe and North
            America. Outstanding exceptions have been writers like
            Stella Calloni and Thierry Meyssan. Apart from a very few
            writers like them, international progressive networks of
            intellectual production shamelessly reproduced the motifs
            and misinformation of the NATO government's psychological
            warfare campaign.<br>
            <br>
            ALBA and the Libyan Jamahiriya<br>
            <br>
            Virtually the only regional organization to uphold the
            founding principles of the UN was the Bolivarian Alliance of
            the Americas &#8211; ALBA. The ALBA countries are Antigua and
            Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Saint
            Vincent and the Grenadines and Venezuela. Its
            governments&nbsp; represent over 70 million people. None of
            these countries recognised NATO's illegitimate puppet regime
            in Libya as the representative of the Libyan people in the
            United Nations.<br>
            <br>
            All the larger ALBA countries have been targets of US and
            allied terrorism and subversion &#8211; just as the Libyan
            government was permanently since its revolution in 1969.
            Cuba has suffered economic blockade and US government
            terrorist attacks since 1960. Nicaragua was attacked
            throughout the 1980s. The US government and its allies have
            worked openly to subvert the governments of Bolivia,
            Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. To broad regional concern,
            the US has imposed new US military bases on Colombia and
            reactivated the US Fourth Fleet.<br>
            <br>
            To see what kind of government the US and its NATO allies
            want in the region one has only to look at its allies in
            Colombia, Haiti, Honduras and Mexico. In all these
            countries, abuses of civil and political rights are far more
            egregious than under the Libyan Jamahiriya. Journalists,
            human rights activists and trades unionists are murdered
            frequently, with impunity. In terms of social, economic and
            cultural rights all of these countries fall far short of the
            achievements of the Libyan Jamahiriya.<br>
            <br>
            To see what lies in store for the people of Libya as a
            colony of NATO country governments, Haiti is the&nbsp;
            model. Farcical, heavily militarised elections, organized
            with laughable incompetence, will be held without the
            country's largest political movement being allowed to
            participate. Foreign NGOs will fail lamentably, but
            profitably for them, to deliver anything approaching
            adequate health and education services to the population.
            Government resources will be ruthlessly pared back so as to
            maximise profitable opportunities for private companies.<br>
            <br>
            By contrast the ALBA countries share with the Libyan
            Jamahiriya a socialist inspired, solidarity-based
            system&nbsp; of successful wealth redistribution and social
            provision via a strong welfare state, ensuring adequate
            education and health care free to their countries'
            low-income majorities. That is why the United States
            government and its allies persistently denigrate and
            undermine the ALBA countries. It is why they destroyed
            Libya. <br>
            <br>
            The US government and its allies cannot accept successful
            countries which exploit national resources on behalf of
            their peoples rather than selling them cheap to Western
            corporate elites. The socialist-inspired ALBA countries are
            economically successful and make steady progress towards
            resolving their complex social problems. By contrast, the
            Western Bloc neo-liberal model pursued in Mexico, Colombia,
            Honduras and Haiti has resulted in chronic basket-case
            failure. <br>
            <br>
            Apart from the psychologically conditioned populations of
            North America and Europe, the whole world can see this for
            themselves. Internationally, US and European political
            representatives talking on economic and social matters are a
            laughing stock. They get a respectful hearing only because
            they have sufficient military firepower to blow the planet
            to smithereens and have shown they are brutal and
            dysfunctional enough to do it.<br>
            <br>
            With their always fake claims of economic competence made to
            look absurd, even the last two trump cards of the Western
            powers - human rights and corruption &#8211; fail to turn a trick.
            The governments of countries like the US, Britain, France
            and Spain have always been vicious human rights abusers in
            conflicts both domestic and international. The NATO
            countries' bogus war on terror has seen Abu Ghraib, Bagram,
            Guantanamo and extraordinary rendition for torture become
            the foreign symbols of&nbsp; their common abuse of civil and
            political rights both overseas and at home.<br>
            <br>
            Likewise, the financial crisis that broke in 2008 has
            revealed just how deeply run the corrupt links between
            corporate finance and government in Western political
            systems. Governments have protected their corporate
            financial elites, who depend on illicit money laundering and
            Central Bank largesse to stay liquid, while condemning tens
            of millions of their compatriots to poverty. That is without
            examining recurrent scandals involving defence and energy
            multinationals, like British Aerospace in the UK, ELF in
            France or rampant cronyism throughout the US
            government-military-industrial complex.<br>
            <br>
            Muammar Al Ghaddafi and Augusto C. Sandino<br>
            <br>
            It is no accident that the ideological vision underlying
            ALBA has much in common with the vision of the Libyan
            Jamihiriya. Among the forerunners of the Libyan Jamahiriya
            and the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas, the heroic
            Libyan martyr Omar Mukhtar &#8211; like Abd El Krim of the Rif &#8211;
            was contemporary with Nicaragua's Augusto Cesar Sandino. It
            is easy to forget or ignore the spiritual, moral dimension
            of the anti-imperialism those revolutionary forebears
            bequeathed to the generation of leaders like Daniel Ortega
            and Muammar Al Ghaddafi. <br>
            <br>
            The brutal murder of Muammar Al Ghaddafi reveals the true
            dimensions of the continuity between his moral and political
            vision and that of Sandino and Sandino's contemporaries.
            Conscious of this continuity, NATO's political leaders
            deliberately set out to murder Ghaddafi's family, his
            children and his children's children. In committing this
            profound moral transgression, white-collar barbarians like
            Obama, Clinton, Cameron, Sarkozy and their colleagues have
            disturbed the West's own foundational cultural concept of
            hubris along with its corollary, nemesis.<br>
            <br>
            The morally wretched frauds who lead the Western
            electoral-oligarchies have every reason to fear the
            inspirational power of heroic martyrs like Muammar Al
            Ghaddafi. Imperialist gangster forebears, Calvin Coolidge
            and Henry Stimson, Franklin Roosevelt and Cordell Hull,
            likewise feared and denigrated the liberating symbol of
            Augusto C. Sandino. Engendered by the customs and thought of
            their peoples, emblematic heroes like Sandino and Ghaddafi
            pose an undying challenge to the corrupt, sterile greed of
            foreign conquerors.<br>
            <br>
            The anti-imperialist revolutionary spiritual vision of
            Augusto C. Sandino envisaged a society of communal
            solidarity embracing the whole of Latin America and the
            Caribbean. That Sandinista vision has many roots, in
            indigenous philosophical thought and religious belief, in
            Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var's ideas of a united Latin
            America, in the sacrifices of innumerable martyrs from Tupac
            Katari to Jean Jacques Dessalines to Jos&eacute;
            Mart&iacute;, in the complexities of the Mexican revolution,
            the influence of the Russian Revolution, in masonry and
            esoteric currents of anarchism. <br>
            <br>
            The same is certainly true of Muammar Al Ghaddafi whose
            philosophical and religious thought is even more
            inaccessible to Anglo-Saxon and European minds than that of
            Augusto C. Sandino. Muammar Al Ghaddafi's vision was one of
            direct solidarity-based communal democracy, of Pan-African
            unity, of a broad African alliance able to withstand the
            economic and military aggression of the predatory Western
            powers. His determination to defend this vision lead
            directly to NATO's aggression and to his horrific murder,
            which Hillary Clinton, the exemplary yankee sadist, found so
            amusing.<br>
            <br>
            For the rest of the world, North America and Europe now
            represent crass economic failure, egregious domestic and
            international human rights violations, systemic corruption
            and criminal militarist aggression. Whatever prosperity and
            advanced civilization the Western powers have ever enjoyed
            was always based on genocidal military aggression and the
            subsequent criminal exploitation of the destroyed peoples'
            natural and human resources. The destruction of Iraq, Haiti
            and Libya embody that reality for the 21st Century.<br>
            <br>
            The only possible sustainable economic model in the world
            now is one necessarily built on socialist inspired
            solidarity-based cooperation between strong nation states.
            That model was exemplified in the Libyan Jamihiriya and its
            regional relations. The only other region in the world where
            such a model exists is among the ALBA countries of Latin
            America and the Caribbean. The oligarchies of North America
            and Europe reject such a model because they refuse to share
            the world's resources equitably. <br>
            <br>
            The only model the Western oligarchs accept is their own
            unsustainable model of world domination. That is why the
            United States and its allies wage endless war on humanity.
            They will continue to do so until either they are
            strategically defeated or they destroy humanity altogether.
            That was the meaning of the murder of Augusto C. Sandino. It
            was the meaning of the murders of Patrice Lumumba and Che
            Guevara. It is the meaning of the murder of Muammar Al
            Ghaddafi.<br>
