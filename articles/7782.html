This is due to the efforts of the Comapñeras and Compañeros and also to the will, both of you, and of the China’s Leaders.</span></span></strong></p>

Strengthen it more. And that's why, I think, it is because we know that these are historic ties, that there is so much strength in the impulse, in the promotion of our current relations.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">And we cannot fail to recognize how and how quickly the Government of President Xi Jinping, the People of the People's Republic of China, has demonstrated and has also achieved the affection and recognition of the Nicaraguan people; because everywhere people can see the buses that have arrived from China and the support for Housing.</span></span></strong></p>
