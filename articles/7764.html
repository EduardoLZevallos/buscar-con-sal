<p><strong>MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL UNITY<br />
OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA<br />
AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE NICARAGUA SOLIDARITY CAMPAIGN ACTION GROUP (NSCAG)</strong></p>

<p><strong>18 OCTOBER, 2025</strong></p>

<p>Comrades Members of the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign Action Group, Comrades Trade Unionists,</p>

<p>Compañeras and Compañeros,</p>

<p>It is a special honour for me to address you on this Annual General Assembly and to convey the Fraternal Embrace, as Revolutionary Sisters and Brothers, from our Co-Presidents Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Compañera Rosario Murillo Zambrana, who from the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity and the Sandinista Front for National Liberation, continue to lead our People, Government and Party through the Paths of Dignity inherited to us by our General of Free Men and Women, Augusto C. Sandino.</p>

<p>We want to express our gratitude for the solidarity, the affection and the constant work you have done for so many years to inform, clarify and defend the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>You have remained firm and tireless, walking alongside the Nicaraguan People and the revolutions and progressive forces around the world, despite the systematic media campaigns to discredit our popular and anti-imperialist process, attempting to minimize the enormous and significant advances the Revolution has made in favour of the humble, working People of Nicaragua.<br />
<br />
We participate in this event receiving your expressions of Solidarity with the People of Nicaragua, but we are also here to express our own unwavering Solidarity with the Peoples who are today fighting for their Freedom, Sovereignty and Self-determination.</p>

<p>Comrades, Compañeros and Compañeras,</p>

<p>The Nicaraguan People knows of Struggles and Victories. A People who have been so often and in so many ways intervened by US imperialism knows of Struggles and Victories. From whose midst a Latin American and Caribbean Hero such as Augusto C. Sandino emerged, who confronted, defeated and expelled the Yankee invaders from our land, and whose example is inherited by the Sandinista Front for National Liberation, which continued Sandino's anti-imperialist struggle and led the Nicaraguan People to the Victory of the Sandinista Popular Revolution in July 1979, which many of you can remember, playing an important role in its defence in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Precisely because of the popular and anti-imperialist nature of our Revolution, the empire was quick to unleash a counterrevolutionary war that destroyed the country in the 1980s, causing more than 50,000 deaths.</p>

<p>With the Solidarity of the world, with the Heroism of our Nicaraguan People, the Revolution was able to achieve significant social, political and economic progress. Progress in health, education and the restitution of rights, despite the war imposed by the empire.<br />
 <br />
Many of you also remember the imperialist blackmail, another form of Yankee intervention in our land, which brought darkness and ruin to the country in the 1990s and early 2000s, until the Sandinista Front came back to government in 2007, beginning a new stage of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, marked by a Ray of Hope for Peace, Reconciliation, Progress and the Well-being of the Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p>Under the flags of the Sandinista Front, led by our Comandante Daniel Ortega and our Compañera Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua quickly embarked on the paths of social justice, the restitution of rights, well-being and peace.</p>

<p>Nicaragua demonstrated that a Popular Revolution is capable of improving the lives of its People by fostering development, restoring the rights that were taken away by the empire, the oligarchy and its neoliberal model, while remaining firm and loyal to the Sandinista Revolutionary political thinking from which it emerged.</p>

<p>The fight against poverty is the central element of the National Human Development Plan, our Plan to Fight Poverty, which firmly upholds free health care and education as fundamental rights. Access to basic services such as water, electricity, roads, hospitals, clinics and schools began to reach rural communities, uniting the country. The country's production and income increased year after year, while the rights of women, youth, workers, Indigenous and Afro-descendant Peoples, and the entire Nicaraguan People prospered under the leadership of the Sandinista Front.</p>

<p>The Sandinista Front's successful leadership was recognized by our People in the national, municipal and regional elections of 2016 and 2017, so much that the empire, along with the bad sons and daughters of Nicaragua, the same traitors as always, the same sell-out oligarchs, could not hide their fear for these many advances, that they conspired to facilitate a new form of Yankee intervention in 2018, with the purpose of destroying this beautiful new page in the history of our People and trying to fulfil their central objective of destroying the Sandinista Front and, as they said at that time, to “physically eliminate the Sandinistas.”</p>

<p>They financed, intervened, lied and manipulated through main and social media, committing atrocities and murders against the peaceful Nicaraguan People in an attempt to dismantle the Revolution through a coup d'état, which failed due to the firmness of our People, of the Nicaraguan workers, who confronted this new form of Yankee intervention and its oligarchic allies and defeated them, once again.</p>

<p>Once the attempted coup d'état was defeated, our political leadership, the Sandinista Front, the Revolutionary Government, set out to strengthen the victories achieved and defended by the People.</p>

<p>We set out to strengthen the defence of the Revolution so that imperialist and oligarchic attempts could never again even peek through a small crack of history. We set out to defend and consolidate the Revolution.</p>

<p>In these seven years since the 2018 coup attempt, we have increased our productive capacity and the country's income, built more hospitals, more schools and more roads. Every day we are providing and bringing more basic services to more communities. We have increased our food security based on the commitment and enormous productive capacity of our rural producers. We have strengthened our security measures and continue to be the safest country in the region.</p>

<p>In short, we declared that our main enemy is poverty, which we have significantly reduced in recent years. The security and stability of the Nicaraguan society remain as central elements in the consolidation of peace and well-being.</p>

<p>This year, we reformed the Constitution to strengthen our model of popular democracy and the role of the people as leaders of the revolutionary process. To this end, we align public institutions in a clearer and more coherent manner in order to better serve our people, allowing for greater economic growth, greater security and social stability, as well as the permanent restitution of rights of the Nicaraguan families.</p>

<p>Comrades, Compañeras and Compañeros,</p>

<p>The People of Nicaragua remain committed to continue strengthening the Sandinista Popular Revolution, even more so in this world threatened and attacked by the darkest forces of history, installed within the neoliberal governments of the global north, who seek to impose their unipolar hegemonic model and their corrupted thinking, in an attempt to stop the sovereign advances of Free Peoples like Nicaragua.</p>

<p>This very dangerous world is characterized by the emergence of the vilest forms of capitalist exploitation. A neo-fascist ideology that stops at nothing, that respects no rights, treaties or agreements when it comes to unleashing its destruction on Peoples and the planet, to impose their way of thinking in the name of generating profit.</p>

<p>We are witnessing difficult times in the world, times of profound transformations and great challenges, of much confusion, but it is also a time of great clarity regarding the need to continue working toward a Multipolar World that is emerging before our own eyes.</p>

<p>A Multipolar World that promotes unity, dialogue, mutual understanding, greater solidarity and mutually beneficial cooperation is needed for peace, well-being and justice. A Multipolar Order free from hegemony and unilateralism, free from neo-colonial, imperial and fascist impositions, where we can deepen harmonious bonds of friendship, with respect for Sovereignty, Independence, Self-determination and Dignity of the Peoples of the World.</p>

<p>This new world belongs to all of us, to the Peoples who continue to walk on the paths of unity, defending the Revolution. Being a revolutionary at this stage also means recognizing and working tirelessly for Peace, which is not only a Right, but a necessity.</p>

<p>Nicaragua will continue its unwavering support and solidarity with the Brotherly Bolivarian People and Government of Venezuela and the Sister Cuban Revolution, which are suffering the onslaught of cruel, constant and inhumane aggressions and blockades imposed by imperialism.</p>

<p>In these times of confusion and manipulation, it is imperative to reiterate the principle that Latin America and the Caribbean, the Caribbean Sea, is a Zone of Peace, and that no power has the right to undermine, intervene or destabilize it.</p>

<p>We express our unwavering solidarity with the Brotherly People of Palestine and their just cause. Nicaragua will continue to denounce the genocide and extermination of the Palestinian People and will continue to condemn the violations of international law by the State of Israel.</p>

<p>Sisters and Brothers,</p>

<p>You, who “live in the belly of the monster”, as José Martí characterized it, have to endure the terrible economic, political and cultural consequences of the prevailing neo-fascist and neoliberal thinking.<br />
<br />
We express our respect to you, who remain steadfast, strong and determined to continue fighting, from within, for your own rights, and for the rights of the Peoples of the World.</p>

<p>This has enormous and significant value to us. Speaking and acting in solidarity, during these times, has a very special meaning.</p>

<p>This Revolution finds its greatest expression of sacrifice in our Heroes and Martyrs, among whom we count, with special recognition and love, those Brothers and Sisters who came from afar in terms of distance, but very close in terms of shared thinking, and gave their lives for social justice in our Country.</p>

<p>Today and every day, we recognize the work you do for Peace in the world. Many of you have lived among our People, and others have visited our country driven by the idea of building a fairer world.</p>

<p>In this second stage of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, the enemies of justice, of truth, the enemies of the rights of the People are the same as in the past, but they come in a different wrapping.</p>

<p>In these times, we must know how to identify and find our revolutionary and progressive compass, amidst this tide of falsehoods, distortions of the real truth, as our Comrade Rosario Murillo says.</p>

<p>Our history is clearly divided between the Popular Movement and the Oligarchic Thinking.</p>

<p>In these difficult and confusing times, the choice is clear between the oligarchic, elitist, entitled and racist thinking that is willing to do anything to maintain its power and privileges, including facilitating foreign intervention; and the Popular Movement, which inherits the best of our people's history of struggle. There are no half measures. In Nicaragua, we are a Popular Movement expressed in the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>Comrades, Sisters and Brothers,</p>

<p>At this meeting, we remember, celebrate and express our gratitude for your firmness, perseverance and permanence on the side of the Popular Movement, on the side of the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p>With much love. With much gratitude. We continue building the Revolution.</p>

<p>Thank you so much.</p>
