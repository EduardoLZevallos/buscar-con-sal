      <br>
Nicaragua is in a similar position to Ingrid Bergman's protagonist in
the 1944 film &#8220;Gaslight&#8221;, victim of a sinister conspiracy orchestrated
by a murderous seducer-thief and his coldly calculating accomplice. In
the film, Bergman plays a woman systematically isolated by means of
mental torture by her tormentors who try &#8211; and succeed &#8211; to make her
doubt her own reason. They do so by all means of tricks, one of which
is to cause the gaslights to dim, making her think that she is somehow
unconsciously or mischievously responsible.<br>
      <br>
Those tricks and techniques have been perfected by President Obama and
his cold, calculating sidekick Hillary Clinton, applying them with
relish to victims on a global scale. Both are robbers of the
aspirations of whole peoples &#8211; including their own people in the United
States. Through their unprovoked wars of aggression, both are authors
of the mass murder of untold thousands of people. They accomplish their
crimes through seductive speeches about democracy, liberty and
prosperity while cynically and sadistically sinking their victims into
death, impotence and misery.<br>
      <br>
The diversity of the techniques of emotional and psychological
manipulation of so called fourth generation warfare may seem new.
Recent decades have seen efforts by the US military to appropriate
anthropological methodology so as to dominate what they term the &#8220;human
terrain&#8221; of the countries they occupy during their wars of aggression.
No doubt, particular techniques may be new, but the essence of
psychological manipulation has remained unchanged for centuries. That
essence has been superbly expressed in &#8220;The Turn of the Screw&#8221;, the
short story by Henry James, brother of William James, the great US
psychologist and philosopher, .<br>
      <br>
In the story, just as in &#8220;Gaslight&#8221;, the protagonist is a woman, victim
of a situation of tension and fear bordering on terror. But the key
element &#8211; doubt, uncertainty, suspicion, is even more exaggerated in
James' story than in &#8220;Gaslight&#8221;. In part, the story achieves this
effect by leaving its ending inconclusive &#8211; no Scotland Yard policeman
turns up to arrest the villain. But the force and power of the story
derive more than anything from its ambivalence about the possible
presence of spirits, which quits any possibility of emotional security
for the protagonist and also any certainty for the reader about what
has actually happened.<br>
      <br>
The US government achieves this effect by the use of ghosts equivalent
to those in James' story via their own fictions, like the &#8220;war on
terror&#8221; and the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;. The ghosts are entities like Al Qaeda
or the FARC. Are they not holed up defeated in their caves and
mountains and forests? No. We are told they are everywhere. Colombia's
President Alvaro Uribe insists the FARC are defeated. The US government
says the FARC are more dangerous than ever. That is why Southern
Command needs seven extra military bases in Colombia and two extra
naval bases in Panama.<br>
      <br>
The case of Nicaragua &#8211; from the absurd to the sinister<br>
      <br>In
the case of Nicaragua as the protagonist-victim, the psy-warfare is
characterized by lies, half-truths, crude manipulations of history,
fantastic curses, and far-fetched tall tales. The basic technique is
that of propaganda guru Edward Bernays, used with such success by the
Nazis, as Bernays himself acknowledged : one big lie mechanically
reproduced in industrial quantities, flooding the news and information
markets. Those news markets function on a global level by means of an
imperialist franchise infinite-feedback loop. The franchise is
run from its corporate-governmental head office in Washington via media
disinformation and anti-reporting branches around the world.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's case is especially noteworthy because not all those
branches carry the imperialist brand. Some pirate clone-branches stick
to and assist the franchise propaganda because their influential
managers are people friendly with or loyal to the franchise's
Nicaraguan salespeople like Dora Maria Tellez, Victor Hugo Tinoco,
Sergio Ramirez or Gioconda Belli. This irregular pirate element adds to
the atmosphere of mystery, insecurity and suspense required to induce a
more intense psychological crisis in the victim.<br>
      <br>
The superficial content of the psy-warfare waged against Nicaragua is
very simple. In line with the practice of Bernays and Goebbels, it
projects one single basic image-concept, namely, that the government of
the Sandinista Front for National Liberation under President Daniel
Ortega is a corrupt, repressive anti-democratic family elite bent on
controlling the country for personal financial gain. From that enormous
original lie the last three years have seen generated a fertile
genealogy of all kinds of falsehoods.<br>
      <br>
The absurd aspect of the psy-warfare against Nicaragua is that it takes
a truly superhuman effort to ignore the expressions of approval by
prestigious world institutions about the integrity, competence,
creativity and responsibility of President Ortega's government.
Examples abound. Miguel d'Escoto won support for his election as
President of the UN General Assembly based on his own personal prestige
as Foreign Minister of the first FSLN government and on the
demonstrated worldwide prestige of the FSLN led by Daniel Ortega that
promoted d'Escoto's candidacy.<br>
      <br>
UNICEF has praised the Nicaraguan government's effort to eradicate
illiteracy and improve education in the country. The UN's Food and
Agriculture Organization has recognized as among the best in the world
the Nicaraguan government's efforts to improve its people's food
security. The International Monetary Fund has repeatedly recognized the
competence and commitment of Nicaragua's Central Bank and Treasury
Ministry officials in the country's economic management.<br>
      <br>
This year, during Nicaragua's Universal Periodic Review in the UN Human
Rights Council more than 60 out of 69 countries rated as extremely good
the Nicaraguan government's promotion of human rights. Apart from the
self-evident advances and benefits achieved by programmes like Zero
Hunger, Zero Usury, the Yo Sí Puedo literacy campaign, the Misión
Milagro health programme, the Programa Amor child protection programme,
and the Voice for All programme for people with disability, the UN
review also covered improvements in civil rights, especially reforms to
the criminal justice&nbsp; system. Likewise the review emphasized the
complete freedom of expression in Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
It is absurd that this reality is hardly ever reflected in commentary,
reports and analysis published by the international corporate media and
their sympathizers in alternative media ideologically opposed to the
FSLN. This fictive-absurd aspect of the psy-warfare against Nicaragua's
government complements and strengthens that war's fictive-sinister
aspect. This sinister aspect is beaten out of innumerable deceits,
little and great, derived from the original master-deceit template. The
deceits are stamped out with extraordinary coincidence between both the
official imperial brands and the pirate alternative clones.<br>
      <br>
The range and reach of the imperialist franchise<br>
      <br>
Even prior to the FSLN's taking office for the second time in January
2007, the imperialist franchise was launching desperate propaganda
attacks. The enemies of humanity simply could not believe, let alone
accept, that a force they had thought was fatally wounded could
confront them once more. The attacks became even more ferocious once
President Ortega made clear the reach and seriousness of his
government's program. At the level of regional and international
relations, what most frightened the enemies of humanity was the threat
of a union of peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean under what has
now become the Bolivarian Alliance of the peoples of the Americas &#8211;
ALBA.<br>
      <br>
In the international corporate media the psychological assault&nbsp;
proceeded as one might have expected through outlets like the New York
Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, he Economist, the
Guardian, El País, Le Monde, CNN, the BBC and their various
international counterparts. All these media have large resources and
permanently take advantage of the prestige those resources give them so
as to serve in practice as broadcasters of their governments, the
Western Bloc governments of North America, Europe and their Pacific
allies.. As well as those corporate media. The campaign to calumny the
FSLN government has been supported either sporadically or constantly by
alternative information media like Le Monde Diplomatique, Inter-Press
Service, Counterpunch, ZNet, Dissident Voice, the North American
Congress on Latin America, among others, and individual bloggers on
progressive web sites.<br>
      <br>
On considering why there should be that strange coincidence of opinion
&#8211; so starkly contradicted by the facts - running the gamut of political
ideology, one common factor stands out. The publishers, editors and
writers all form part of the Western Bloc countries
intellectual-managerial class. They have class interests in common and
advance arguments based on shared themes, especially the theme of civil
and political rights.<br>
      <br>
In practice, Nicaragua's FSLN government dismantles those arguments, as
the facts demonstrate. No one can say the lies and omissions propagated
by anti-FSLN media are the result of an honest mistake. A world of
difference exists between a sincere research error or oversight and
dishonest manipulation of objective facts readily available for
journalists or writers to verify &#8211; or falsify &#8211; via authoritative
sources.<br>
      <br>
Dimming the lights, turning the screw<br>
      <br>
A few brief recent examples illustrate this basic truth. So as to cover
the whole political spectrum, these examples are taken from the
revolutionary Solidarity web site
(http://www.solidarity-us.org/current/node/2710), from the
social-democrat Inter-Press Service
(http://ipsnoticias.net/nota.asp?idnews=94638), and from the right-wing
Wall Street Journal
(http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703444804575071061739029230.html).<br>
      <br>
The main themes are always the same : that President Daniel Ortega
violently represses his opponents, that the Citizens' Power Councils
are merely a party tool, that President Ortega makes corrupt use of
ALBA cooperation funds, that NGOs are persecuted, that the 2008
municipal elections were fraudulent and no observers were allowed; the
economy is a mess. The coherence of these false accusations across the
political spectrum is impressive, especially when they can be readily
exposed as false with even a minimum of research.<br>
      <br>
Almost the complete range of these accusations appears in an article
(&#8220;Looking back at the FSLN's elections loss&#8221;) by a blogger called
Dianne on the web site of the revolutionary North American
organization, Solidarity. Dianne writes that in the municipal elections
in 2008 &#8220;the only international observers allowed were from Venezuela&#8221;.
This blatant lie is contradicted by the presence as electoral observers
of over 150 observers from all over Latin America and the Caribbean.
They came from prestigious electoral organizations, members of the
Quito Protocol&nbsp; and the Tikal Protocol as well as representatives
from Mexico's Electoral Tribunal.<br>
      <br>
Among many other unsupported accusations, Dianne also claims, &#8220;...the
Zero Hunger program is administered by the CPCs. Since the Venezuelan
aid ($250 million in 2008 alone) does not pass through the national
budget, but is handled by a Venezuelan-Nicaraguan joint venture that
Ortega controls, aid operates as a source of corruption and patronage.&#8221;
The Citizens' Power Councils do not administer the Zero Hunger
programme or any other government programme. They are consultative
community bodies whose composition and practice, as one might expect,
vary greatly from one place to another. <br>
      <br>
Dianne's false accusation omits the various formal national and
bilateral structures that govern the use of funds derived either from
commercial sales of oil by PDVSA to Albanisa or from funds made
available by Venezuela's development bank BANDES. In a few false words,
Dianne wipes out the oversight by the Economic Commission of
Nicaragua's National Assembly, the Bank Superintendent,&nbsp; the
Controller-General, the Tax Office, the Customs Service the audit
systems of PDVSA and BANDES and the controls exercised by the various
ALBA councils.<br>
      <br>
Just on those two points one can see Dianne's ignorance and bad faith.
But perhaps much more culpable is the intellectual dishonesty of José
Adán Silva and his editors at the Inter-Press Service in an article
entitled &#8220;Corruption in the times of ALBA&#8221;. It is worth pointing out
that José Adán Silva reports for the Nicaraguan daily newspaper El
Nuevo Diario, owned and run by the Chamorro family media dynasty,
die-hard enemies of the FSLN. <br>
      <br>
As one might expect, Silva's report omits the least expression of a
point of view that supports the Nicaraguan government. He quotes four
sources &#8211; all opposed to the government, with no attempt to support
their false statements with trustworthy data. His article appears to be
about corruption and ALBA. But it mentions none of the relevant bodies.
      <br>
      <br>
No reference is made to the joint-venture company Albanisa, the
respective State oil companies Petronic and PDVSA, nor of ALBA-Caruna,
the financial institution charged with handling funds derived from
Venezuelan solidarity. Silva does not mention that Petronic emerged
with great credit from a recent audit by the Controller-General. Nor
does he note that the Controller General is soon to audit Albanisa. Nor
does Silva mention the internationally acclaimed social and economic
programmes financed with Venezuela's solidarity-based cooperation.<br>
      <br>
On the other hand, without offering any particular case for appraisal,
Silva does mention the alleged repression of opposition demonstrations,
assaults on freedom of expression, attacks on NGOs. Everything he
reports is based on the opinions of opposition figures like Carlos
Tunnerman Bernheim, ex head of the opposition Movement for Nicaragua
organization, a body funded almost entirely by the US government or its
associated bodies. Among other downright lies, Silva quotes Bernheim
saying, &#8220;The Central Bank indicated that as a result of the drop in
international cooperation, the government of this Central American
country needs to cut its budget by US$500m, while reducing spending on
social programmes in areas like education, health and food.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
Silva cites no precise source to corroborate Bernheim's deceit. It is
extremely unlikely Nicaragua's Central Bank would state something
completely untrue. Development cooperation funding did drop in 2009,
mostly by US$40m in budget support from the European Union and US$60m
in grants from the Millenium Challenge Account. Of those US$60m over
US$50m were replaced by new funding from ALBA. Contrary to Bernheim's
falsehood, the major drop in government income to occur in 2009 was a
dramatic fall in tax and customs revenue as a result of the
international economic crisis. In September 2009, Treasury Minister
Alberto Guevara reckoned tax income had fallen by around US$150m. Silva
does not even mention that crucial fiscal reality.<br>
      <br>
Silva's Inter-Press Service article deepens its falsity by quoting
Irving Davila of the Coordinadora Civil, a group of NGOS that in
practice operate as yet one more little opposition political party in
Nicaragua. Davila alleges quite arbitrarily that more than 300,000
people fell into poverty in Nicaragua in 2009 &#8211; making the overall
figure for people in poverty 10% more than in 2008, a completely
ridiculous figure. By contrast, the country's Continuous Household
Research programme, run by the Nicaragua's Institute for Development
Information, advised by the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean and other international bodies, indicates that
poverty in the country has diminished since 2005 by about 5%. Silva
could easily have quoted that figure but chose not to do so.<br>
      <br>
If one goes on then to read the Wall Street Journal, one finds an
article by the right wing columnist Mary O'Grady repeating the same
falsehoods, lies and omissions. With no attribution, O'Grady alleges
that Daniel Ortega &#8220;has taken over large swaths of the economy&#8221;. She
writes, &#8220;Mr. Ortega gets oil from Mr. Chávez at a discount but only
pays 25% of the Chávez price up front. The rest is a long-term loan.
Mr. Ortega sells the oil at the market price and pockets the gain.&#8221; As
a matter of fact, Albanisa, the Nicaraguan-Venezuelan joint venture run
by the countries' respective State oil companies pays 50% of the price
within 90 days, not 25%.<br>
      <br>
Once more, all the Nicaragua, Venezuelan and ALBA institutions involved
in controlling and processing Venezuela's cooperation with Nicaragua
are erased from the record. O'Grady's crude, calculated lies omit that
all the transactions concerned take place via commercial and financial
structures duly supervised by Nicaraguan State entities, Venezuelan
bodies and those of ALBA. Nor does O'Grady offer the least evidence or
detail of the &#8220;large swaths&#8221; of Nicaragua's economy supposedly
controlled personally by President Ortega.<br>
      <br>
It is sobering to realise that O'Grady's carefully calculated idiocies
appear in the Wall Street Journal, virtually the official journal of US
high finance. No surprise then, with O'Grady's quality of information,
that the giant US economy is in the toilet, with a huge budget deficit
dependent on foreign forebearance and real unemployment levels around
18%. No one is confident the official unemployment level of 10% will
fall dramatically in the near future. <br>
      <br>
Furthermore, recent auctions of US government debt have not gone well.
Foreign buyers seem to be drifting away, forcing domestic buyers to
purchase what's left. Many observers think the Federal Reserve and the
US Treasury are in cahoots to monetize US government debt, something
Federal reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said publicly will not
happen. For the moment attention is focused on Greece and the Euro. But
further financial and economic crisis in the United States is
guaranteed.<br>
      <br>
All that is worth mentioning in the context of another O'Grady
falsehood, when she writes of Nicaragua's economy, &#8220;investors are
fleeing the country and the economy is anemic. An electorate that never
was very fond of Mr. Ortega is growing more dissatisfied.&#8221; The facts
are the reverse of this malicious disinformation. Investment levels and
export levels are both near record levels in Nicaragua. Those record
levels were achieved under this self-same FSLN government in 2008.<br>
      <br>
A recent national opinion poll with a representative sample showed
approval for the work of President Ortega's government had risen three
points to 48%. O'Grady alleges that 60% of the population opposes the
FSLN . No representative poll has shown that. What has been shown is
that support for the FSLN is running at almost double that for the
other opposition parties combined while 25-30% of the population has
yet to decide for whom they will vote in the national elections of
2011. These are encouraging figures for the FSLN and explain the sheer
desperation of anti-democratic columnists like O'Grady, who
enthusiastically supported the coup d'etat in Honduras along with the
vicious repression and abuses that accompanied it.<br>
      <br>
Ghosts in the light of ALBA <br>
      <br>
All these examples follow the same pattern of deceit and falsehood set
out by writers like Roger Burbach (published by the North American
Congress on Latin America), or anti-reporters like Rory Carroll of the
Guardian and John Carlin in the Independent. It is hard to believe that
such an ideologically broad campaign, one contradicted almost entirely
by the facts, is not carefully orchestrated by the enemies of real
change on behalf of the impoverished majority in Latin America. Despite
its crude use of blatant lies, the campaign does deploy a certain
psychological subtlety.<br>
      <br>
At the same time as it recruits the support of media sources loyal to
the empire in the international corporate media, it also counts on the
arrogance of the Western Bloc countries' progressive
intellectual-managerial class. The people who make up that class lack
sufficient intellectual humility to recognize they are wrong on
Nicaragua, that the facts contradict the falsehoods they have
circulated. Still, they refuse to let the truth spoil the agreeable,
seductive tales they spin for their market audience.<br>
      <br>
The tall tales published by NACLA, Wall Street Journal, Inter-Press
Service and other similarly unscrupulous outlets are indeed carefully
calculated to seduce their audience. One is dealing with ideological
marketing directed at clearly identified and characterized
market-audiences. It is an extremely pernicious infinite feedback&nbsp;
system, like marketing cocaine or tobacco or alcohol. The propaganda
sells the product in accordance with the client's tastes which the
marketing itself shapes over time. The client becomes dependent,
incapable of freeing themselves emotionally or intellectually from
their habit. The habit becomes an imaginative and intellectual prison,
more effective than any prison of iron or stone.<br>
      <br>
Inside Nicaragua, the credibility of that propaganda has plummeted as
social and economic indicators and daily reality continue inexorably to
show that the FSLN government's programme is actually improving
people's living standards. Nicaragua's people have new opportunities to
develop their country despite the international economic crisis that
has flattened rich-country economies. That reality results from the
solidarity-based cooperation of Cuba and Venezuela within the framework
of the Bolivarian Alliance of the peoples of the Americas &#8211; ALBA.<br>
      <br>
Alba has made this possible by reinforcing already existing available
resources. But, in the same way Nicaragua has been targeted for
psy-warfare by global disinformation media, likewise it is very
difficult to find positive references to ALBA in those same corporate
and alternative media. When they do occur, the great majority of
references to ALBA are dismissive.<br>
      <br>
ALBA is the most advanced model for change towards genuine sovereignty
and independence in Latin America. In Central America, Nicaragua
fulfills the same role that ALBA does at the wider regional level. That
reality is unacceptable to the US government and its allies, to their
corporate media and to their progressive fellow-travellers. For that
reason they deliberately provoke doubt, suspicion and uncertainty by
every possible means. They deliberately confuse the minds of their
market-audience with deceit and the omission of basic facts that
contradict that deceit.<br>
      <br>
They try to render reality obscure and suspicious. Then in that
information twilight they tighten down the screws of their media
machinery so as to further distort the truth. From that they make
spring forth imaginary ghosts and false fears to shock their audience
even more. These are the same psychological tricks, techniques and
methods used by tyrants, despots and dictators throughout human
history. They insist their terror is justice, their exploitation is
equality, that war and death add up to freedom, that slavery is
democracy and indebtedness prosperity.<br>
      <br>
The FSLN government and its allies in the Bolivarian Alliance of the
peoples of the Americas are lighting the way for people all round the
world to escape hopeless corporate capitalist obscurantism imposed by
the US government and its allies. In response, the immensely powerful
governments promoting corporate capitalism are deploying all their
powerful, sophisticated psy-warfare machinery to try and snuff out that
light. It remains to be seen what they will do&nbsp; when they realize
their psy-warfare ghosts of fear and terror have failed.<br>
