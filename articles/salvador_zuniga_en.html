July 29th Tortilla con Sal managed to talk to Salvador Zuniga, veteran
leader of the indigenous peoples' movement in Honduras. Zuniga talked
about what is currently happening in Honduras. At the time of the
interview, Zuniga and other leaders like Bertha Caceres and the
garifuna Miriam Miranda were in temporary encampments In Nicaragua set
up to give some respite to Hondurans from the fierce military
repression in Honduras, especially along the frontier with Nicaragua.</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">The
sudden influx over the weekend of July 25th-26th of over 4000-5000
people&nbsp; dissipated in subsequent days so that as of Monday August
3rd perhaps only 250 or so Hondurans remained at the frontier in
Nicaragua.&nbsp; People headed back to Honduras as the army there
relaxed the State of Siege measures along the Nicaraguan frontier.
People returned in part because Manuel Zelaya's strategy of a
negotiated return to Honduras via the frontier at Las Manos had clearly
failed. In part too they returned because humanitarian support beyond
initial relief was simply not available. </span><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">In
this interview, Zuniga discusses the military repression and relates
the march carried out by 300 indigenous people to the frontier - only a
group of 40 managed to complete the journey. He speaks of the grave
danger of&nbsp; what is happening in Honduras not just for the Central
American region but for all of Latin America.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">The coup</span><br><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Tortilla con Sal: We are here now with Salvador Zuniga. What is your organization and what is happening in Honduras?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Salvador
Zuniga: COPINH (the Civic Council of Honduran Popular and Indigenous
Peoples' Organizations) - what is happening is a war against an unarmed
people, against a people that is simply insisting on the reinstatement
of the President they elected four years ago.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
this war, they imprison people. They have reached the point where every
day they are jailing up to 300 people. In El Paraiso the holding cells
overflow so they take people to the local stadium.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">They
have murdered people, just like the death squads who, after people go
to a demonstration, they abduct them, torture them to death and cut
their throat and then they dump the body nearby the demonstration. That
was what happened to Pedro Magdiel (Muñoz Salvador). That was how they
captured him.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We
see the army fire on a demonstration producing many wounded and then
when there is a death the Human Rights Ombudsman, the coup supporter
Ramon Custodio Lopez says they were firing rubber bullets. But it has
been proven that they are M-16 rounds. There is persecution throughout
the country.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">They
(the coup leaders) have always violated the Constitution of the
Honduran Republic. They abused it when there was the presence in
Honduras of the Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries, the presence of US
troops, when they disappeared people in the 1980s - all these things
are violations of the Constitution.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
Constitution states that in Honduras there should be no privileged
classes, but even so these powerful elitist groups are taking over
rivers to make dams to sell electricity for their private benefit. They
get an annual subsidy from the State of 20,000,000 lempiras (about
US$1m) - the rich, the elite groups, the powerful people who run things.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">They
violated the Constitution when they installed a President of Panamanian
nationality, whom they imposed, Ricardo Maduro. That was an abuse of
the Constitution.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Vote for a fourth ballot</span><br><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
simply for an opinion poll initiated by Manuel Zelaya, President of the
Republic, which was non-binding, but rather a vote to discover what
Honduran people thought, to see whether or not they agreed with the
installation of a fourth ballot in the November elections.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There's
a ballot to vote for mayors, another for parliamentary deputies,
another for the presidency and that fourth ballot was for the reply to
a question that would have said " do you agree with the calling of a
national constituent assembly? Yes or no?"</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
the republican democratic system, the sovereign is not a king or a
queen because there is no king or queen. In a democratic system it is
not an autocratic State that is, as it were, God's representative, as
one supposes the Pope, or someone similar to be, that holds sovereignty.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Our
Constitution says that the people is sovereign. And so then, why a coup
d'etat? They say it was because Mel (Manuel Zelaya) wanted to abuse the
Constitution of the Republic. But the Constitution establishes
precisely that sovereignty belongs to the people. But it also says that
among the President's functions is to comply with and to facilitate
compliance with the Constitution of the Republic and with international
treaties. And there are international treaties that establish that we,
the people, have the right to express ourselves.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So then it was simply a question, a consultation and that set off a tremendous persecution.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
order to receive our President whom the Honduran people elected for
four years we came with 300 people and they impeded us, stripping away
our right to freedom of movement. Then they confiscated our buses and
when we set off on foot they came after us.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">To the frontier on foot</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:&nbsp; Where did they take away the buses? </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">SZ: Leaving Tegucigalpa just by the turn off for Tatumbla.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:&nbsp; But that's barely outside Tegucigalpa's Central District!</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">SZ:
Right. And we set off from there, walking, walking, walking. We came to
the second military roadblock in Zamorano and got round it. We reached
the third in Ojo de Agua and got round that one too. We reached another
one further on at Las Crucitas and got round it. Then another in
Arenales. The First Lady of our country was there. We got round that
one too and from that point the chase began to stop us going any
further. We came via the highway but then took a diversion to fool them
(the soldiers), because they were up ahead and then they opened fire.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS: With live rounds?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">SZ:&nbsp;
With live rounds, sure. And so from there to here we began walking not
along streets or roads but through open hill country. When we came that
way they could no longer see us and we lost them.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Along
the way they no longer pursued us by land but they began using Tucans,
military attack planes, to come after us. These are warplanes, for
killing. Us there, then, in the hill country, people beaten up and
suffering.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">On
the way we passed through a town called San Matias in El Paraiso. Right
there were the police, to observe that we were arriving that way,
because there were people there who said "there they are..."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS: Informers?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">SZ:
Yes, police spies. So we had to head down river so as to reach a place
called Santa Rosa. But imagine, that is a really dreadful march, at
night without lights. And we made it to Santa Rosa and the chase began
again because people again informed on us. So we had to head back again
towards El Paraiso. There we were able to take part in a demonstration
blocking the main highway and we got some encouragement from the people
there. We stayed the night there.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Then
next day we carried out the manouevre that brought us here to
Nicaragua. Seventy of us were caught going one way and the others were
captured going another way. The group of seventy were surrounded by the
army at gunpoint - understand? - and taken to the army holding cells in
El Paraiso. Then they were thrown into container trucks, locked inside
and sent to Tegucigalpa. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">A
few others of us had stayed in the demonstration, the next day they too
were surrounded, captured and also thrown into container trucks. They
were taken to San Pedro Sula. People were almost suffocating. Almost
suffocating, something terrible, insane.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">That
is to say, it was not an armed column. The people didn't even have a
machete to cut through the forest there with the army on top of them,
all because they were coming to receive the President and protest
against the coup d'etat.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We
had again to pass through the hills until we reached here in Nicaragua
and from here to see how to help the President's return to Honduras.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">We have regressed 30 years</span><br><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
what is happening in the country is something incredible. We have
regressed 30 years. We thought coups d'etats were something long out of
date. Much less did we think they were going to use the armed forces
with all their weaponry, with warplanes, to repress the population.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is something completely senseless. But if you head in that direction
just a little way, right there now are the army posts and that is
happening throughout the country. Throughout the country people are
disappeared, they grab them, they capture them and they disappear them
- they don't come back.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
are a number of people in San Pedro, they disappeared two members of
the Unificacion Democratica party of the Popular Bloc. And there are
people there with gunshot wounds, grazes, because that's how it is in
the street, people are shot and left there.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
one ends up saying "what can this be? It is not possible." Against
democratic change. And they (the coup leaders) say that this is
communism, that Chavez is going to come. Lies! Lies! That's their
excuse for the repression. But one cannot imagine what we have been
through. And still look, here we are and we are content because we have
a roof and are able to sleep.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Up
in the hills, in the mud, with rain and all that. And it was not just
us who in the end, after 300 has set out, only 40 or so of us could get
here. The majority were detained. Even today they detained another
dozen, ten garifuna who came with their drums and two of COPINH.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">One
asks, "But what is going on?" Something completely insane. Practically
a state of war. The curfew is not from 6.00pm to 6.00am as it was in El
Salvador during the war there. In Honduras the State of Siege is
continuous.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;"></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Coup regime crimes</span><br><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">I
left the column of the little group in which we came, several times to
go and buy food - and people were there with that fear, that shock.
People are not permitted to go to El Paraiso to buy things because they
have imposed a criminal curfew night and day. People can be detained in
Tegucigalpa, anywhere</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
were two deaths yesterday at a football match. Motagua was playing
Olimpia, they are two of the most well known teams in Honduras. So when
people left the stadium, the police were there and people got angry,
they were overcome with the tension of the coup d'etat and began to
shout "Coup-mongers out! Coup-mongers out!"The police started shooting
and there were two deaths, young people with all their life ahead of
them.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">One
asks, "what has happened to our country?" in such difficult
circumstances. We have reached the point where everything has been
lost. We have gone back years and years and years and years. In that
sense we therefore have a very dark outlook ahead because even if the
President is reinstated, we don't want the negotiations to permit
impunity, that they allow an amnesty for crimes committed against
civilians.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is different with crimes that are political in character, but crimes
like these, shooting at unarmed people. And in this, there is no doubt
at all that there is a major intervention by the Venezuelan ultra-right
who were the ones that first began working on this coup d'etat - Robert
Carmona and Otto Reich - to turn Honduras back into what it has almost
always been, playing the role of a terrorist base to attack democratic
processes.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This
is a coup d'etat not just against Honduras, it is a coup d'etat against
the Central American region and against Latin America. If they get away
with this coup d'etat, one may see that Guatemala follows suit, or
maybe El Salvador. And so once more the army, the armed forces are
going to begin to take decisions of active policy making in Latin
America. And we are going to return to the era of the guerrillas too,
to the era of bloody savagery</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Civil war?</span><br><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
Honduras we are doing all we can to overthrow the dictatorship without
resorting to the use of a single weapon, not even a nail cutter. And
although it may be illusory to think that it is possible to defeat them
with ideas, with mobilization, with civic resistance, it would be very
sad if this failed and a level of armed confrontation were reached.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is a scenario that is not far off, the scenario of a civil war, an
outcome that unfortunately always means suffering for the impoverished,
for children and for everyone. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">However
the international community also have to play their part. Our people
are fighting an unequal struggle, a struggle of unarmed people against
people fully armed, of non-violent people against very violent people.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
is a sinister person in our country's history called Billy Joya
Mendola. He and Alexander Hernandez and other people like Juan
Evangelista Lopez were the ones who disappeared people. This government
has Billy Joya as a ministerial adviser on security matters. He is the
one waging the dirty war of torture and disappearances.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
now who is also on the other side directing operations? Tiger Bonilla
(Colonel Arturo Corrales) one of the most terrible individuals who was
also in the era of the death squads.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is incredible! Imagine, look in El Salvador for example, the
confrontation was armed. The people had to arm themselves and had to
fight. But in Honduras, people are completely defenceless. And people
are fighting. Every day they are mobilizing, There hasn't been a single
day since June 28th without resistance action: Every day despite what
they (the coup leaders) have wanted.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
simply when we were coming here, when we all met up in the southern
highway (out of Tegucigalpa) at Plaza Villas del Sol, we were there
with our flags and everything since we were on our way here and their
were fighter planes over the demonstration. One asks "Could it be that
they are thinking of using them?" Because the simple fact that they fly
over us amounts to psychological warfare.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Now
people are afraid. They are afraid there in Danlí. Now just the sight
of them (the military) makes people tremble. They say "Be careful".
People are in a very difficult situation . When they go to the
demonstrations they are active and so on. But then when they are alone
they feel a situation of panic.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">The soldiers</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There are many soldiers falling sick and also they are unpaid for the month of June and they are denied weekend leave.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
psychological operation they are running includes a dose of pills that
they give to the soldiers. That pill makes their eyes go red and
increases their aggression and they take a powder that they use at the
military posts, a powder that is a bit like the powder used in a tear
gas round and they apply it to the troops and it makes them weep. Then
they put them doing exercises and manoeuvres. But they are not eating
well and that pill they give the troops quells hunger pangs.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Plenty
of the kids in the army want out, they are in a war situation against
an enemy that is the ordinary people. It makes no sense to wage war
against unarmed civilians against whom they are ordered to open fire.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">At
that football stadium, when Ramon Custodio Lopez said they were rubber
bullets, those were live rounds, 5.56 from an M-16. So the situation of
the military is an abuse of their own human rights, because keeping
them drugged up all the time so as not to have to feed them - that's
something really serious</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
yesterday Billy Joya came to the area to do an appraisal of the
operational situation and to prepare more repressive operations against
the population. A soldier even raised a pistol to Xiomara (the
President's wife) when she was at one of the roadblocks. Things that
are quite incredible.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
