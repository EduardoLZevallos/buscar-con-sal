<td style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"> At the end of July, Tortilla con Sal interviewed Lic. Jorge Martinez
Gonzalez and Lic. Armando Chible Sandoval, President and Assistant
Manager respectively of the savings cooperative Caja Rural Nacional
R.L. (Caruna). </span><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">Caruna is the body that administers funds made
available for development projects in Nicaragua within the framework of
the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). Currently, ALBA's
member countries are Cuba, Bolivia, Dominica, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
The Honduran government has announced that it too intends to join ALBA
shortly.</span></td>

<br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">So Nicaragua's experience is important as an example and model of the
economic alternative based on solidarity and fair terms of trade that
ALBA represents. This interview highlights three fundamental aspects of
Nicaragua's experience in that context.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><table style="text-align: left; width: 650px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

<td style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">Firstly, it shows
clearly that ALBA prioritizes the needs of the sectors most affected
and most marginalized by twenty years of policies imposed by the rich
countries and the international financial institutions they dominate</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">Secondly, one notes the threat represented by the success of the ALBA
agreements to the system of economic domination established via the
ruthless economic policies of the rich countries. </span><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: sans-serif;">Finally, one can see
also the key role played by local news media in defence of the
imperialist model of economic, financial and cultural domination by
denigrating, undervaluing and dismissing the dramatic ,encouraging
alternative ALBA represents for the region's impoverished majority.</span></td>

<br><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : Perhaps you could give us a general overview of Caruna's work within the ALBA framework?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: We have an agreement with PDVSA to hold and administer funds. An
agreement that frees up 25% of the oil invoice traded via an oil
distribution company in Nicaragua. We use that 25% to channel credit to
the farming and production sectors in our country and of that, up until
May this year we had placed C$440 million córdobas, a bit more than
US$22 million dollars to be more exact. And we had benefited about
50,000 people in 57 cooperatives of producers, cattle farmers and small
farmers throughout the country. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Those
C$440 million, those US$22 million, have been placed at an interest
rate of 8% on the balance, with different payment dates and periods
depending on the activity financed. If it is basic grains, rice or
beans or vegetables then those have a payment period of one year. if
the activity is plantain or similar plants then the payment period is
two years. If it is to develop cattle production or small businesses
then the credit is given over three to five years.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">That
has benefited those 57 cooperatives and 10,000 individual small
farmers. And Caruna reaches&nbsp; from Bilwi, or Puerto Cabezas, to
Somotillo on the Honduran border with 25 branches throughout the
country. As well as that we use the country's network of cooperatives
to make loans with Caruna&nbsp; so that credit reaches small farmers.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We
have alliances in Chontales through the Caja Rural de Chontales, in
Nueva Guinea with the Banco de San Antonio, a cooperative, and we are
working also with the Fundación El Rama. These are the remotest parts
of the country. And we are about to open an agency in Bluefields in the
Southern Autonomous Region where we used not to have any branches.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">That
is what the funds are used for, from 25% of the oil receipts. The other
25% freed up goes to the common fund of the ALBA member countries,
Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Those countries decide how
those resources are invested&nbsp; and we have an agreement with them
to administer those funds. So it is ALBA-Caruna that manages that ALBA
fund.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Both
funds originate from the oil receipts but the agreements are with
PDVSA, or PDVSA-Caruna to hold and administer those funds correctly. Of
those funds that have been used, US$20 million has been assigned to the
Streets for the people programme,&nbsp; that's about C$400 million. And
for improvements to public transport initially US$2 million have been
assigned but that will reach US$5 million. That is to say a little more
than C$100 million to modernize transport. And we are also supporting
the construction project Houses for the People, with a first stage of
400 houses for a sum reckoned at US$5 million. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
all that money is going into the country's basic infrastructure,
streets, highways, houses so the least well-off people can... for
example, the houses are available via a credit programme with a maximum
interest rate of 8% with a maximum payment period of 20 years so that
producers or in this case the beneficiaries of the Houses for the
People programme can acquire these houses and be able to pay for them.
The houses have three rooms, with a false ceiling, a porch, a kitchen,
a washing area ... they are about 200 square metres. The sites are
located in high value areas. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Those
are the main programmes. The total number of families
benefited....because within the global amounts of credit we have talked
about some programmes are quite specific.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We
have a programme of artisanal fishing for the Northern and Southern
Autonomous Regions that benefits 830 artisanal fishing workers. We have
a programme of cattle rearing worth US$6 million scheduled to rear
24,000 calves and benefit 1675 producers. We have a programme of
agricultural inputs benefiting 8000 farmers via the distribution of
urea at a fair price, Urea for the People. And in coordination with the
Agriculture Ministry, MAGFOR, we have a programme to distribute seed
and inputs to a total of 87,000 families in that small farmer programme.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
with that 91,720 who are being benefited, we have a total of about
170,000 Nicaraguans benefiting directly from those funds, the ALBA fund
and the ALBA-Caruna fund. Between the two we have 170,000 Nicaraguans
benefiting. So that is the coverage. While it is true that we are still
not in every municipality, with the upcoming result of credit
programmes in collaboration with BANDES, we now have US$10 million for
the Zero Hunger programme which are going to go into the Food
Production Bonus.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
we have US$10 million for a credit programme for women, for women
owners of small businesses in the country's urban centres. That should
benefit 43,000 individuals. 33,000 women with a loan of up to US$300
per person and 10,000 women via the Food Production Bonus. And the
financial mechanism for this is BANDES, the Social Economy and
Solidarity Bank of Venezuela. They have an office of representation
here in Nicaragua.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : And in Nicaragua BANDES channels its funds through ALBA-Caruna.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM :&nbsp; To a value of US36,958,000.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : And that is in addition to the ALBA funds.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM : Exactly</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : Is that a donation?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Part of the funds are non-returnable, the Zero Hunger programme which
is US$10 million and the US$2,958,000 which are for artisanal fishing.
Those are non-returnable for people in Nicaragua, so as to capitalize
impoverished Nicaraguan families. And the rest, some US$24 million, are
a credit to strengthen the productive capacity of the agricultural
sector, to increase employment opportunities and also opportunities for
women in the country's urban centres to have productive employment via
Zero Usury.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : It would be interesting to know something about the kinds of agreement Caruna has with PDVSA and BANDES.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Well, with BANDES the relation is one of equitable credit, reasonable
payment periods, up to ten years to pay, annual interest rates of one
to three per cent. That is in relation to the loans. The credit via
Zero Usury does not pass 4%. And in the case of credit to cooperatives
for production or cattle rearing, it's the same, interest is never more
than 5%. And for individual producers interest rates don't exceed 8%.
It is a relation of equitable credit.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">On
the agreement to hold and manage money from the ALBA fund, basically
what we have is an agreement to hold and administer those funds so as
to place them correctly with fair, accessible interest rates that
differentiate them from the conventional banking system and other
financial outfits in the country. And that agreement to hold and manage
the ALBA funds, the ALBA signatory countries decide on how to use it
for the purposes of social investment.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS :&nbsp; How is the executive that decides on the use of the ALBA fund made up?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
:&nbsp; Requests come from society in an organized way via the
Citizens' Power Councils for example to the Association of Democratic
Mayors&nbsp; who are responsible for the street improvement programmes.
They make the request via 102 municipal authorities throughout the
country so as to access the benefits of the ALBA funds. They present
the projects to Caruna. We sign an agreement with them and that project
is being implemented throughout the country.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : But you cannot take the decision just like that. Don't you have to consult with someone?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: The ALBA signatory countries decide. From requests from over a
hundred municipal authorities throughout the country both Liberal and
Sandinista. 87 of the country's municipal authorities are Sandinista.
The rest are Liberal. And 102 of those municipal authorities&nbsp;
benefiting from the Streets for the People programme. So they make a
request via their organization which is the Association of Mayors and
each one states the number of blocks to pave, how much it will cost.
They make the proposal for the bidding and issuing of contracts to the
companies who will undertake the work.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
generates employment. It employs local labour for laying the paving
blocks and the pavements and doing all the work involved in that. And
what we do is pay the contractors on the basis of the contracts for the
work they carry out. They have a supervisory system for the work, to
follow up the work, because it would be impossible for us to go to each
municipality. So the municipal authorities participate in the
supervision, follow-up and control.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS
: Just to be completely clear about this point. You receive the
requests from the municipal authorities. You pass those requests to
whoever says yes or no. But what is the body that authorizes you to
disburse funds for this or that project?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: The ALBA Presidents have a meeting. The countries that have signed up
to ALBA on terms of extraordinary cooperation decide. There is an
executive body that takes decisions on the social projects. It is at
the highest level.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : So these decisions get taken at Presidential level?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Yes. For example, the public transport subsidy is via the ALBA fund.
The famous US$1.30 . And we are also talking about 17,000 pairs of
tyres of the 25,000 that were agreed. The automatic barriers for
control of bus passengers too. They are being processed normally. And
likewise the batteries, the lubricants and other inputs. That is a
support fund for the transport sector with credit at rate completely
unknown in the country. Because those tyres are being financed over two
years at 4% interest. That's less than the international rate, less
than the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, Libor.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS
: One of the doubts the news media raise, without answering it, is on
the agreement ALBA-Caruna has with PDVSA to pay those loans.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: What we are going to pay is 25% of the oil invoice. We're going to
pay over 25 years. We have two years' grace and 23 years to pay with an
annual interest rate of 2% on the balance which depends on the
invoicing procedure. That is what we are going to pay. Because for the
other fund the payment plan is agreed.&nbsp; It is a debt of
ALBA-Caruna in accordance with an agreement signed by Asdrubal Chávez,
Vice-President International of PDVSA and by Jorge Martinez Gonzalez,
that's me, President of Caruna. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">That
is the agreement for the fund relating to the first 25% and this is the
other one on the other 25% also signed by Asdrubal Chávez and Jorge
Martinez. So in this case this 25% we are placing with a rate of 8%.
With 2% we manage to cover our operating costs and get credit to people
out in the countryside and also cover other contingencies that can
occur in managing these finances. We have provision for bad debt that
we add on, apart from the 8%. In the end, in the period available to
pay the credit since the funds are freed in cash by agreement with the
oil distributor to Caruna's account as stipulated by PDVSA, we are the
ones who are going to pay PDVSA. It is not a debt of the Nicaraguan
State, nor of any institution of the Nicaraguan State.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS
: That is a point on which some Nicaraguan economists have remarked.
For example, Nestor Avendaño has suggested that when money is loaned to
IRTRAMMA or ENATREL or GECSA, then that money could turn into a public
debt.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Not at all. I want to say the following on that. In Nicaragua, during
the previous government energy distribution was privatized and now a
multinational company has it, Union Fenosa, a Spanish company. And what
was beforehand a single company was broken up into generators,
transmission operators and distributors. The generators are GECSA, some
private companies, like Corinto, Tipitapa Power, AMSFEL and others.
Those are the generators. The transmission operator is ENATREL which is
a State company. And the distributor is Union Fenosa which charges for
consumption.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We
could say that people are trying in bad faith to sell the idea that the
resources freed up from the oil invoice and that we have made available
to the generating and transmission system is a public debt. But really
it is not a public debt because in parallel we have a contract with
Union Fenosa where they recognize that all the resources handed over to
the petrol companies or to the generators is on behalf of Union Fenosa.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Union
Fenosa receives a subsidy from the Nicaraguan State derived from the
fact that all Nicaraguans consuming less than 150 kilowatt hours a
month get a subsidy. That subsidy is paid out by the Treasury Ministry
to Union Fenosa. So then Union Fenosa has an agreement signed with
Caruna saying that they pass that to Caruna so as to pay what was spent
on generating and transmitting by Caruna. The debt relationship is that
Union Fenosa owes Caruna. because Union Fenosa receives the benefit of
services from ENATREL and ENEL and from its system of generation and
transmission because they distribute that energy and charge for it.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
then, the one responding for that debt is Union Fenosa and those
critics know it and have kept quiet about it. Even the private
generators like Empresa Generadora Energética de Corinto of Cesar
Zamora, AMSFEL,Tipitapa Power, Puerto Cabezas Power too, they are all
private generators. There is no public debt.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : So Caruna has no loan agreement with public bodies in the energy sector or in any other sector?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
:&nbsp; No. The Nicaraguan State via a law passed in the National
Assembly has an agreement to subsidize all Nicaraguans consuming 150
kilowatt-hours or a month. Since that money is budgeted in the&nbsp;
Republic's General Budget, it has to be released via the Treasury
Ministry. But because that is sometimes somewhat slow and sometimes
Unión Fenosa urgently needs resources, then they signed an agreement
with us. For example, if we give money to pay ESSO&nbsp; and confirm to
the Treasury Ministry that Union Fenosa has signed an agreement with us
then the money we pay to Esso for fuel needed for electricity
generation and subsequent transmission of that power Union Fenosa
states that it releases and endorses that payment from the government
to them in favour of Caruna.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS
: No one has explained that in the news media. It is a constant
strategy of the right wing media to raise doubts they then leave
hanging without an answer. They don't follow up their own questions.
Have you had other experiences of that kind of media manipulation?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Almost all our experience of the media, whether it be with regard to
credit or with regard to the ALBA country funds, the media have tried
to misinform or undermine and cast doubt on the transparency of their
implementation. For example they said the street improvement programme
only benefited Sandinista municipalities.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
as I explained to you earlier, there are 87 Sandinista municipalities
in the country and the street improvement programme is being carried
out in 102 municipalities. A good number of the municipalities
benefiting are not necessarily Sandinista. And they say the ALBA
projects only benefit Sandinistas. But where they are doing those
thousand or so streets across the country it's not just Sandinistas
that live there. Liberals and Conservatives do as well, the whole
people live there. Whether they vote for or support the Revolution is
another matter. But no one asks who lives there. The only thing we know
is that on those streets live low-income people, hard working people,
people who spend the summers in clouds of dust and the winter with
great puddles of water and now things are different for them.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
they try and say they don't understand the contract procedure, but
basically all the country's construction companies are working on that
program even the biggest ones. Private companies like Llansa, de
Guerrero, Oirsa, small ones, medium sized ones, as well as the biggest
ones, are all working. And they all say the mechanisms are transparent,
that they have applied for contracts, offered their services and been
been awarded contracts&nbsp; to pave the streets. That is one example
of the disinformation those news stories wanted to give.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">They
have tried to demonize the relation Caruna has as ALBA-Caruna with the
Venezuelan cooperation programme. But we have agreements of
collaboration and administration contracts with another 23
organizations, private ones, national ones and international ones. For
example we have agreements with Holland's Rabobank Foundation, with
foundations in Italy and in Wisconsin in the United States, with Swiss
Workers Aid, with BECU, with OXFAM-UK, OXFAM-Belgium, OXFAM-Canada,
with the European Union in COSUR in Rivas. So we can say we have a
broad range of agreements, contracts and lines of credit with other
organizations.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
that is never mentioned. All that gets mentioned and demonized is the
relation and cooperation with Venezuela because they want to say the
funds are badly used, that there's no transparency and that they
accumulate debt. Even the figures that they give, in the alleged
figures they give, they always give inaccurate information which is the
information they themselves suppose.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : Have you had requests for interviews from local journalists?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Within the framework of our public relations and media relations we
have developed information for national media on what we do, for
example, when we open a new branch or when we hand over a new loan. The
information is public.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
some media, like El Nuevo Diario or La Prensa, have come asking for
information and ask questions in bad faith. We had an event in the
PAEBANIC centre to talk about the agricultural cycle with 63
cooperatives and 100 leaders. We were talking about interest rates,
loans, the sectors we support. And one of those journalists came up to
me and said &#8220;Caruna manages the ALBA money......don't you think that
money comes from shady sources?&#8221; So when someone starts to talk like
that, I have to say, &#8220;Look, excuse me I cannot discuss the matter with
you because you are presupposing things that don't exist or exist only
in your imagination....&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">AC : In that event we were explaining the different programmes we had with Wisconsin, Alba Caruna and so on.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM : We were presenting via Datashow.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">AC
: So they are watching, all those news media but... they are not
seeing. We put everything on the screen. But the journalists don't see,
What they see is the dark side. They see the words ALBA-Caruna and are
prejudiced. So there's good reason not to help that along when the
journalist concerned is in bad faith and only wants to find something
bad. They just have to see that it's Chavez, that it's ALBA, that it's
ALBA-Caruna and there, it's bad.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: What's happened is that our experience with these news media has been
that they misreport the information. If one sets out in good faith to
talk about our programmes about amounts of money or the number of
people benefiting, the headlines they put are &#8220;Caruna moves from being
modest cooperative to being a nice little earner&#8221; or &#8220;Caruna's nice
little earner&#8221; and in Nicaragua that means something that smacks of
fraud.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : But Caruna has been around for twenty years.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
:&nbsp; Fifteen years, and in those fifteen years we have now got
15,500 individual members and 25,000 members in the cooperative network
with 40,000 affiliates. We are holding C$80 million in our members
savings.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : Your experience is mainly in agriculture.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Yes. Our members have those C$80 million. We have C$40 million plus
in capital. We have C$20 million in subscriptions. So we are talking
about more than C$140 million belonging to the cooperative's members.
We process more than C$2 billion a year. In transfers, we transfer
funds both nationally and internationally. We change bankers cheques.
We buy and sell foreign exchange. We carry out all those financial
operations as a cooperative legally authorized to do so and it's worth
noting that we carry them out with operating costs only 30% of which
are generated by interest charges. 70% are generated by the other
financial services that Caruna offers throughout the country.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : So the legal framework for you is the Law of Cooperatives.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">JM
: Yes. Law 499, the General Law of Cooperatives that makes us a
cooperative body working throughout the country to which we can
affiliate any man or woman prepared to accept Caruna's statutes and
by-laws and also in the case of different bodies, we administer funds
on their behalf in accordance with their interests.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">For
example we have an agreement with Los Pipitos. Los Pipitos gives credit
to parents of children with disability. So we signed an agreement and
we release to Los Pipitos or to the&nbsp; parents they instruct us to.
They don't have to be members of the cooperative. We have an
administrative agreement with Los Pipitos so Los Pipitos tells us to
give so much to such and such a family who have children with
disability.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Or
for example, a support program for war victims called Provictima. So
Provictima tells us to give such and such a citizen who was wounded in
the war, either of the army or of the Contra, whatever may be their
background, and we pay out against their identity card. That support
carries zero interest. They give us separately two per cent to cover
Caruna's operating costs in making those loans.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">These
administered funds assist different sectors in the nation's life and
the funds' owners tell us they are interested in offering loans to this
or that group or sector and that's how we work. It is not from one day
to the next that Caruna that has sprung into life. Of course, the
support the Unity and Reconciliation Government has given the
cooperative sector and the productive sector in general is an
extraordinary effort. We judge it in that way.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is an extraordinary effort via the rural credit fund, via the
Agriculture Ministry MAGFOR, via the Institute for Rural Development,
via the National Investment Fund, via the agreement BANDES has with
Caruna. If it were not for the relationship President Ortega has with
Venezuela, probably we would not have that credit relationship with
BANDES and that has helped us a lot in reaching the small farmer. And
very probably if another government had been in power we would not have
had access to those funds nor to the funds freed up from the oil
invoice.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Naturally,
the relationship existing as regards coverage, both in terms of
Caruna's seriousness and the transparency of its controls mean the
government can permit us to have a direct relationship with PDVSA with
regard to the funds they have made available. And naturally it is also
important that we enjoy a relationship of cooperation and alliance with
the government that is using its power in favour of impoverished people.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS
:&nbsp; One can suppose that increasing production in the country by
means of a broad supply of credit to sectors previously excluded is one
of the aims of this big effort on behalf of people on very low incomes.
And perhaps another objective is to create conditions that oblige other
entities offering credit in the country to adjust their lending
practice to the new reality brought about by government policies in
favour of low income people. How do you see that process and what
changes do you hope to see in the future?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">&nbsp;JM
: We hope Caruna's impact in the agricultural sector and in the small
business sector will contribute to helping the banks and financial
outfits not regulated by the banking sector make a serious analysis
leading to decisions that improve financial services. And above all to
reduce the cost of accessing credit, because many costs are added on to
the interest that have to do with the way they calculate their
operating costs, their running costs and their collateral costs. And
what we seek is to be an alternative for the sectors that have
traditionally not had access to credit because that was the idea we
started out with in 1994.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Prior
to the closure of the National Development Bank, agricultural credit
was available throughout the country and that was when we founded
Caruna, precisely to create other alternatives for farmers. Now we aim
to deepen and consolidate Caruna's leadership as a cooperative, improve
our services, keep our whole system up to date, train people well, hand
back surpluses to the cooperative members, make sure they are using
their membership cards and encourage them to grow as members of the
cooperative. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
more than anything we hope the big business people who are bank
shareholders might be able to, although this is something that one way
or another has been happening, since interest rates have dropped from
an average of more than 20% to 16% or 18%. Credit costs have fallen.
But that we are expecting the finance sources to drop interest rates
without proposing it openly? No. We are going ahead, like the poet
said, we are making our way by walking it.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">AC
: This is very important. Because if we are talking about the play of
the free market then there are a couple of important things. First that
these 130,000 people once they have an alternative, some economic
sectors, where they were paying and paying without any possibility of
playing a real role in the economy. They are receiving help. A big
percentage did not get any help before. In other words we are moving
from quasi-employment to a real employment for a small business person.
So that makes it more possible for Nicaragua to close the gap a little,
not much but to start closing the gap caused by emigration to other
countries.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Now.
That family remittances are a great boon? No. Family remittances are
not a blessing at all . For me quite the opposite. They are dreadful
because they leave our gross domestic product in other countries. There
they leave US$5000. Here they place barely US$300. And these are
Nicaraguans who could be producing US$800 or US$1000 for Nicaragua. Our
gross domestic product would be increasing and our per capita income
too. It is something important that hardly anyone sees. Or at least ,
those who don't want to see.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">On
the other hand if we are talking about free markets, as Jorge said, it
is not that we are pressing for interest rates to drop. How is there
any pressure for interest rates to drop? There lies the big concern
of&nbsp; the other micro-credit outfits. If our interest rate was
already averaging 16% or 12 % that has been substantially what we have
been working with, then people realize that there is strong
exploitation from the other financial entities. that is going to make
the producer, the small business person stop and choose. &#8220;Pay me 20,
30, 40 per cent&#8221;.......&#8221;No, why should I if there they are offering at
10%.&#8221; So one way or another those lenders have to readjust too and
lower the interest rate.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS : In other words people are empowered....</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">AC
:&nbsp; They're empowered. Now they have a chance. Now they have an
opportunity. And that of course helps a lot. And what does that mean
here? For example those 130,000 people benefiting now what is happening
is that things are freeing up resources for them so they have more
income, because if I sow an acre of beans and before I was paying C$200
in interest from that acre, now today I am only paying C$40 or C$50 and
I keep C$150 extra to improve other things. It's true that's not much
in the national economy but we are going to see that what benefits the
members of the cooperatives benefits the national economy too.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Copyleft tortillaconsal 2008 </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">http://www.tortillaconsal.com</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
