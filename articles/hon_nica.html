Maybe the poet T.S.Eliot had corporate mass media in mind when he wrote
in&nbsp; 'Burnt Norton' : &#8220;human kind cannot bear very much reality.&#8221;
In reporting on Honduras and Nicaragua, or anywhere else in the
world, Western Bloc media &#8211; of the United States, Europe and their
Pacific allies - serve in practice as propaganda outlets for their
governments. Spoon fed with skewed agency reports and government media
briefings, supposedly prestigious media, from the BBC to the New York
Times, omit or distort relevant facts, caricature perceived opponents
and fail to catch important developments. <br>
      <br>
In the case of Honduras, the corporate media line has been that
power-hungry leftist President Manuel Zelaya tried to railroad his
re-election. Totally false. In fact, a corrupt oligarchic elite,
including people like coup regime leader Roberto Micheletti and others
likewise implicated in narco-trafficking, paid millions of dollars for
a military coup so as to prevent democratic change.<br>
      <br>
On Nicaragua, the corporate media line has been that corrupt,
incompetent President Daniel Ortega has polarized society in his
undemocratic drive to impose a Somoza-like family dictatorship. Also
absurdly false. The Sandinista led coalition government has worked
tirelessly for social reconciliation, rescued Nicaragua's electricity
generating capacity, infrastructure and agricultural economy,
transformed education services and greatly improved health care.<br>
      <br>
In Honduras, the corporate media have failed to report faithfully the
three months of massive nationwide demonstrations, the death-squad
murders, the disappearances, hundreds of non-violent protestors
wounded, thousands detained, the routine torture and abuse. For the
corporate media, repression of free speech in Honduras hardly matters.
They minimize the significance of the closure of anti-coup media like
Radio Globo and Cholusat Sur or the threats against Radio Progreso and
the weekly El Libertador.<br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua, by contrast, baseless, fake opposition claims of
electoral fraud and oppressive censorship have been treated as gospel
truth. The media propaganda benediction of those claims greatly
facilitated anti-democratic opposition legislative boycotts and vicious
neocolonial aid blackmail by the US government and the European Union.
UN recognition of Nicaragua's outstanding achievements in education and
food security has been systematically distorted or outright ignored.<br>
      <br>
In both Honduras and Nicaragua, despite deliberate, systematic attempts
to misrepresent the facts by the corporate media, reality stubbornly
asserts itself, just as it does elsewhere in the world where Western
Bloc countries have sought to impose their imperialist agenda. In
Honduras, despite its serious failures of coordination and organization
&#8211; hardly surprising given the repression &#8211; the National Resistance
Front against the coup d'etat has destroyed the coup regime's pretence
to legitimacy. A poll made public by Narconews shows an overwhelming
majority &#8211; by 3 to 1 &#8211; oppose the coup and want President Zelaya
reinstated.<br>
      <br>
In Nicaragua, despite the cynical hypocrisy of the European Union and
the US State Department, the Nicaraguan goverment has made opposition
claims of electoral fraud and government oppression look stupid. The
opposition never had popular support for their deceitful claims of
electoral fraud. The bogus claims of dictatorship have fallen
completely flat. Right wing Nicaraguan opposition leaders like Eduardo
Montealegre have done their cause little good by openly supporting the
fascist coup regime leaders in Honduras.<br>
      <br>
The Western Bloc corporate media propaganda role in Central America
could hardly be more clear. They whitewash or ignore the crimes of the
Honduran coup regime while omitting or distorting the achievements of
Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government in Nicaragua. This is the minor
version of the major regional media deception &#8211; the hateful
disinformation campaign against steady social and economic progress in
Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia, while blithley ignoring the catastrophic
situation in the societies and economies of Western Bloc allies like
Mexico, Colombia and Peru. <br>
      <br>
In both cases the moral failure is compounded by a professional failure
to catch potentially vital developments at grass roots. For example, in
Honduras the overwhelming movement of non-violent mass protest against
the brutal Honduran coup regime, its police and army, tends to obscure
the reality of an increase in different kinds of armed actions against
the coup regime security forces. Reports of a couple of violent
incidents immediately following the return of President Manuel Zelaya
to his country add a certain urgency to the much-canvassed peace
negotiations between Zelaya and the coup regime leaders.<br>
      <br>
One incident took place in San Pedro Sula on Thursday, October 1st,
when the local organizers of the National Resistance Front lead a
protest march along San Pedro Sula's Seventh Street near the market
area next to the Caba&ntilde;as and Medina barrios. According to eye
witness reports, armed police attacked the demonstrators forcing them
to flee into the neighbouring barrios. In response two distinct groups
emerged to protect their barrios as well as their family and friends
among the demonstrators.<br>
      <br>
The yet to be confirmed reports allege that these groups were heavily
armed with automatic and semi-automatic weapons. One group was the
Salvatrucha 18 mara. Another seems to have been an ad hoc self-defence
group. People in the barrios are reported to have seen six ambulances
take away between 10 and 15 seriously wounded police officers and a
similar number of less seriously wounded, all police. <br>
      <br>
Another unconfirmed report relates an assault, also last week, by an
armed group in Catacamas, the departmental capital of Olancho. There,
allegedly, a police post guarded by around 15 soldiers was attacked.
The report omits information about casualties. The assailants
reportedly took over the police post and cleared out all its weapons
and munitions before abandoning it.<br>
      <br>
These reports point to a fundamental, depressing and uncomfortable
reality. With no clear mechanism leading to a Constituent Assembly, the
popular movement in Honduras is unlikely to accept the brusque
frustration of its primary objective &#8211; to refound the Republic of
Honduras - even if President Zelaya is reinstated. Effectively, only
extremely violent armed repression by the police and the army has
obstructed the realisation of that objective until now.<br>
      <br>
Even if elections are held, and even if President Zelaya is reinstated
for the brief period that remains of his presidency, currently nothing
indicates that a Constituent Assembly is likely to be included in any
negotiated settlement. If that turns out to be the case, after over
three months of sacrifice by hundreds of thousands of people demanding
a Constituent Assembly, the conclusion seems self-evident : the
Honduran people will need to defeat the police and the army by force of
arms. If true, last week's reported events in Catacamas and in San
Pedro's Medina and Caba&ntilde;as barrios shows they have the will to
do so.<br>
