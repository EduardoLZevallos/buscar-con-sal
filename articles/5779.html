and the 80th Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations</b></em></h3>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><em><b>December 18th 2024</b></em></h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Address by Compañero Mikhail Ledenev</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Nicaragua</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Good evening. It is an honor and pleasure to be here with you, Friends of Russia, in Nicaragua.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I have a brief speech dedicated to this anniversary, but before I speak and pronounce the Official Address, I want to emphasize that the beginning of my work here was very intense, very interesting, and I was surrounded by affection and hospitality of all Nicaraguans who helped me take these first steps which I hope will be successful. Of course I'm starting my job here, but I think I'm starting this job on a good note.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">So, Distinguished Members of the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua; Dear Comrade and Friend Laureano Ortega, Special Representative of the President of Nicaragua for Relations with Russia, and Co-Chairman of the Joint Commission between Russia and Nicaragua; Special Guests; Compatriots; Dear Colleagues of the Diplomatic Corps; Friends all.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A very special mention today, Friends, because we are celebrating precisely the Day of Friendship, and it should be remembered that 9 years ago, December 12th became the Day of Friendship between us, Russians and Nicaraguans.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This Reception is dedicated to another important date, the Eightieth Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Nicaragua.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br />
It's time to commemorate these dates, or rather this date today, because we have already celebrated the special day of December 12th, when we celebrated it in Moscow and now the celebration continues here in the beautiful city of Managua.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">And so, our work is a combination of celebrations and of negotiations and meetings, as you know. In fact, many of those gathered here have a very close relationship with my country, and I am very grateful for their contribution to our collaboration, to our very special relationship, as Strategic Allies, Friends, and Partners, we can well say, in International Relations.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">But I also would say that, although we are celebrating 80 years of Bilateral Diplomatic Relations, these Relations developed especially since the Sandinista Government came to power in '79, and since that time our Countries have remained, and will continue to remain, reliable Friends and loyal Allies.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now, the Strategic Alliance developed thanks to the Leadership of President Vladimir Putin and President-Comandante Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo, is characterized not only by the close ties between Russia and Nicaragua, but also by the Solidarity and Common Values that we share.<br />
 </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The fraternal nature of Cooperation, the Political Dialogue of Trust, and our common Struggle for a Multipolar, More Just and Solidarity-inspired World, were underlined by our Foreign Ministers, Valdrack Jaentschke here, and our Chancellor Sergey Lavrov, during the exchange of Messages of Congratulation just celebrated and dedicated to this anniversary.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mutual trust is clearly manifested in all spheres of interaction between our Countries, it is very clearly and prominently present in International Forums, including the UN, and in mutually beneficial and advantageous Bilateral Projects; among these I would highlight the Mechnikov Latin American Institute of Biotechnology, as well as the Training Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia. I am sure that these Projects will continue to develop, obtaining even greater regional importance.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It gives me great pleasure to thank the People and Government of the Republic of Nicaragua for their fraternal support for our Country, especially in this complicated but promising period of international affairs.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We call for States to have the inalienable right to freely choose their own path, based on National Interests and not obeying any hegemony. This is what the UN Charter stipulates in its First Article.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I want to highlight the tireless and effective work of all our Nicaraguan Friends present here; together we have overcome obstacles and achieved the development of Strategic Cooperation in the political, economic, scientific-technical, Security, Health, Education and Cultural spheres.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In all this diversity of joint projects, meetings, contacts and exchanges which testify to the strength of the ties between Russia and Nicaragua, I want especially to highlight the recently held in Moscow, meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Commercial and Scientific-Technical Cooperation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A wide range of topics were discussed in Moscow recently, from the Civil Nuclear Program to Educational Cooperation, and cultural ties.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A video conference was also held between the Parliamentarians of the two Countries, with us are our Friends the Deputies of the National Assembly of Nicaragua who are part of the Friendship Group between our two Countries and they participated in this video conference.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I have also had the opportunity to speak with several Representatives of the Russian Legislature, especially with Compañera Kosikhina, who is the President of the Friendship Group on our side. Among our Parliamentarians she represents the Yaroslavl Region and is very excited about the possibility of contributing her grain of sand to our Cooperation in the political and legislative sphere.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Also last December 12<sup>th</sup>, I was present at the Unveiling Ceremony at the Rudomino State Library of Foreign Literature, of the bust of the Nicaraguan Poet and National Hero Rubén Darío. He is known and appreciated in my country. People quote his verses, since they were translated into Russian and published in millennial editions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now his bust is in the atrium of this Library of Foreign Literature, which is a very important institution in Russia, it is in the center of Moscow and in the atrium there are figures of international importance representing various countries; so now Rubén Darío is also there, who represents Nicaragua, and I think I can quote his words now and I would like to wish all of us to aspire and always strive towards that stature.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I am convinced that together we will further strengthen our Strategic Partnership, and too those of our Countries' Peoples.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live Russia!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live Nicaragua!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live our Brother and Sisterhood!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Thank you very much.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Address by Compañero Valdrack Jaentschke</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>of the Republic of Nicaragua</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Brother Mikhail Ledenev, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to Nicaragua; Compañera Svetlana Petrova, Minister Counselor of the Embassy of the Russian Federation; Compañero Laureano Ortega Murillo, Delegate of the President; Compañero Karen Santamaria; Comandante Lumberto Campbell; Compañero Gustavo Porras; Compañero Daniel Edmundo Ortega.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Compañeras and Compañeros Representatives of the Powers of the State, Members of the Cabinet of our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity, Municipal Authorities of the Citizen Power, of the Nicaraguan Army and of the National Police.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Members of the Diplomatic Corps, International Organizations, and Cooperation Agencies accredited in our Country.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Beloved Officials, and Special Guests of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Nicaragua; Comrades of the Citizen Power Media.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">On this significant occasion in which we celebrate the 80th Anniversary of the establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Sister Russian Federation and the Republic of Nicaragua, we are pleased to convey the Fraternal Greetings in Solidarity of the President of the Republic, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra; of the Compañera Vice President of the Republic, Compañera Rosario Murillo Zambrana, as well as of the People and Government of Reconciliation and National Unity.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Beloved Brother Ambassador Mikhail Ledenev, allow me to repeat the Message of Condolences of the People and the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity of Nicaragua, over the criminal attack against the outstanding Scientist and Military Professional, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his Assistant, an action carried out by Ukrainian terrorist Fascism, yesterday, December 17th. Our sincere and fraternal accompaniment, our Prayers and Affection for the Family of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and of his Assistant.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Brother Ambassador, we also take this opportunity to thank Compañero Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov for the Congratulatory Messages to the Government of Reconciliation and National Unity on the occasion of the 80th Anniversary of the establishment of Diplomatic Relations between our two Countries.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Today we are also celebrating the Ninth Anniversary of the Day of Friendship between Russia and Nicaragua, which is celebrated on December 12th of every year, approved by Law of the Republic on October 7th 2015.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Diplomatic relations between the Russian Federation and Nicaragua were indeed strengthened with the Triumph of the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">As we have reiterated, in the 1980s, when our country had to face criminal imperialist aggression, Nicaragua always counted on the Accompaniment and Solidarity of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This historic relationship between our Fraternal Peoples and Countries has deepened so as to reach the levels of Strategic Alliance, under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin and our Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, who with a clear vision of the challenges facing the World today, work hand in hand for the emergence of a New Multipolar World Order, more Just, more Solidarity-inspired, in Peace, Security, Well-being and Respect for the Sovereignty and Dignity of all Free Peoples.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We convey our highest appreciation and reiterate our commitment to continue working together, for the promotion of the historic ties that unite us, in firm and unconditional support, as well as Cooperation for Political Dialogue, Mutual Understanding, and also, too, our firm support for the Struggle and Ideals that we share with the Brave, Heroic and Ever Victorious People of the Russian Federation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">For Nicaragua, Russia is a key and strategic Partner, we cooperate in effective interaction to resolve the current challenges of the Regional and International Agenda, based on Respect for International Law and the defense of Sovereignty and the Desire of our Peoples to live in a Secure World, without impositions, without hegemonies, and free of threats.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Beloved Brother Ambassador Mikhail Ledenev, you can rest assured and trust that we will continue to promote exchange in the political, commercial, investment, scientific-technical, cultural, and other fields. You can count on our unchanging commitment to continue strengthening our Bilateral Relations, as well as our permanent support in international spaces in defense of the Independence, Sovereignty, Self-Determination of Peoples; Peoples who have the Right to decide our own Destinies.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We express again our gratitude for the Fraternal and Respectful Relations of Cooperation and Solidarity, for the reception of our Delegation and in support of the actions of our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity in the Fight against Poverty on behalf of Nicaragua's Families.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Our best Wishes for Success, Health, Happiness and Prosperity, to you, to your Government, always with the Affection of our Nicaraguan People.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live the Russian Federation!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live Nicaragua!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Long live the Strategic Alliance between Russia and Nicaragua!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </p>
