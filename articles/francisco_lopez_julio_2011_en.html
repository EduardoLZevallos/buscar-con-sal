                L&oacute;pez Centeno, Vice President of ALBANISA</span><br>
              <br>
              Tortilla con Sal, july 14th 2011<br>
            </span> <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : Nicaragua's political opposition insist
            on their criticisms of ALBA on the issue of regulation. Can
            you comment?<br>
            <br>
            Francisco L&oacute;pez Centeno : That anguished questioning
            and wailing from the right-wing, those laments from the
            oligarchy in their stricken neo-liberal system, their
            capitalist system will always deprecate the noble model
            implemented by Comandante Daniel Ortega. They are not just
            deprecating ALBA, they're also trying to criticise the
            humanitarian, noble, Christian solidarity
            based&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; government of our Comandante and the
            Frente Sandinista, criticise the clear and transparent idea
            our coordinator Rosario constantly elucidates in terms of
            Christian solidarity based principles. <br>
            <br>
            The regulatory framework for this business in commercial
            terms is the controlled by the norms, procedures and laws of
            the Republic of Nicaragua. This business complies with a
            thorough process. Every gallon of fuel that arrives in this
            country is logged by the Customs Office. There's a record in
            the National Taxation Office. There are reports. ALBA's
            Internal Audit constantly operates as in any other company.
            But additionally, and here I want to ask you to check with
            KPMG which is an external audit company used by PDVSA
            internationally and which in Nicaragua permanently audits
            our systems, as much of hydrocarbon related products as of
            exports, the use and application of funds &#8211; so in this way
            we have already expressed, presented clear and categorical
            documentation.<br>
            <br>
            Also, recently, here's something we can tell you. Here's a
            document from the Controller General of the Republic of
            Nicaragua. Here are the procedures of verification and of
            oversight. Here's the signature of Dr. Guillermo
            Arg&uuml;ello Poessy, of Lic. Luis Angel Montenegro, of Dr.
            Jos&eacute; Pasos Marciacq, all the Controllers, carrying
            out an audit not just of PETRONIC , but of ALBALINISA,
            ALBANISA, the funds administered by ALBA-CARUNA related to
            ALBA's development cooperation in Nicaragua. We have
            explained this in the National Assembly and the
            International Monetary Fund can confirm this from the
            presentations we have given them and too the Central Bank.
            We are not autonomous. We are regulated.<br>
            <br>
            So the anguish, the desperation, the wailing are going to
            continue because we are going to continue this process . In
            November we'll see the ratification of this project of the
            people, of the impoverished, of all Nicaraguans, which is
            ALBA. The transparency is there in education, in
            agriculture, in cattle farming, in all the benefits that
            ALBA represents in Nicaragua. <br>
            <br>
            TcS : What part do the principles of economic justice and
            redistribution play in the development of ALBA's programmes?<br>
            <br>
            Francisco L&oacute;pez : That is the soul and nerve of ALBA,
            the peoples' alternative, the hope of the people, the social
            impact of each one of the ALBA projects. Just to mention
            one. Today thousands of small rural producers are benefiting
            from the CRISSOL programme. This is the CRISSOL programme
            initiated by our Comandante Daniel together with the
            Ministry of Agriculture which facilitates finance for small
            producers. And look how important that is. Small farmers are
            offered a fair price for their future production which
            allows them to use that future sale to fund inputs and make
            the land productive. <br>
            <br>
            Here you're talking about programmes to restore the rights
            of children, of old people, of the people in general in
            terms of access to free health care and education and up
            till now it's important to mention the impact on electricity
            costs which even with the increase in hydrocarbon prices,
            today energy prices are the same as last year, despite an
            increase of more than 25% in hydrocarbon prices.<br>
            <br>
            That is the decision of a President concerned to maintain
            fair prices for the basic basket of goods so that
            impoverished people can continue getting access to rice,
            beans and tortillas, cooking all, all the basics of life.
            Education continues to be free. On transport you will find
            that in Managua, the classic example, fares remain at two
            c&oacute;rdobas and fifty cents on brand new buses...a total
            transformation, complete satisfaction for families today,
            from the creation of new values and new commitments.<br>
            <br>
            People have hope. That's what ALBA taken altogether means,
            solidarity, humanitarian action, Christian action that
            expresses society itself&nbsp; in a new context, one of hope
            and a new way of life. We are going to bequeath to our
            children and grandchildren a new satisfaction, a new
            contentment, a new peace, a happiness as Rosario always
            describes it. That's what we're talking about. That's ALBA.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : What are the most important programmes?<br>
            <br>
            Francisco L&oacute;pez : The most important programmes in
            humanitarian terms, because all the programmes are important
            but the most important in humanitarian terms are those
            related to food supply, to people's food sovereignty, those
            related to agriculture and cattle production, those that
            guarantee distribution of basic grains via the National
            Basic Foods Company (ENABAS). They are credit programmes.<br>
            <br>
            ALBA's large credit programme for developing food supply is
            fundamental. That is its humanitarian aspect. Then there are
            the education and especially the health care programmes
            which also have credit terms and concessionary financial
            aspects which a capitalist viewpoint will never understand
            because those terms are concessionary. They are loans. <br>
            <br>
            With Usura Zero, with interest rates of 3% or 4%, you know
            you're helping a family get ahead. These are programmes
            whose impact guarantees a family's stability vis-a-vis food,
            health, education and transport. They are highly sensitive
            programmes. A family of four or five children only pay fares
            of just two c&oacute;rdobas and fifty cents which in
            practice should be twice that. And that's without mentioning
            a really important programme for more than 150,000 families
            which is the Solidarity Bonus implemented by our Comandante
            and made possible by the mechanisms of ALBA.<br>
            <br>
            These three programmes together with the commercial barter
            programme which as I told you now exceeds more than US$500
            million throughout this period enabling producers to get a
            fair price for their beans and meat , for their coffee, for
            their oils, for everything we are exporting to Venezuela.<br>
            <br>
            And then too we have programmes of technology and
            development that have to do with the oil refinery which are
            major investments, ALBA solidarity programmes like the
            construction of highways throughout Nicaragua, ensuring
            people's property rights via a programme of the Attorney
            General's office and the Property Superintendent. These are
            programmes that bring people hope.<br>
            <br>
            And that is the Sandinista government, Comandante Daniel's
            government. Those are the instructions we receive within
            ALBA from Rosario, our coordinator and all of us working on
            this project work on those very same lines for the people,
            for the People as President.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : What is your current vision of ALBA's regional
            development?<br>
            <br>
            Francisco L&oacute;pez : This is a genuine alternative
            model, not one in theory but one in practice, one that's in
            process. It is one of Latin America's integration components
            where the concept of economic, cultural and social
            asymmetries&nbsp; offer our peoples the chance of
            development with greater justice, independence and
            sovereignty, fairness with a just restitution of peoples'
            rights and values so as to create a society in which we all
            enjoy rights, adn we all have access to education and health
            care.<br>
            <br>
            It's a model that transcends the traditional model . Two
            centuries under the traditional imperial schemas
            impoverished the peoples of Latin America more and more each
            day, limiting their aspirations more and more each day. And
            it you think otherwise then look at the model now operating
            in Nicaragua&nbsp; which is the Central American country
            with the highest growth, most stability and most security
            including that of its citizens. Here we have one of the
            country's with the best guarantee of organizational
            security.<br>
            <br>
            Here we are consciously working to develop restitution of
            human rights to impoverished people that have been
            restricted under previous governments. That's what we're
            talking about, a new alternative model. And we are
            convinced, and clear that we are a government based on
            principles of socialism, Christianity and solidarity. These
            principles that lead us under this model to treat each other
            with the highly Christian principle of love for one's
            neighbour, a new model of hope, of contentment for families,
            of confidence in the&nbsp; tomorrow of our children.<br>
