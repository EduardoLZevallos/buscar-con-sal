Markets
reacted favourably in early trading to President Obama's announcement
Wednesday that the United States may seek to join the <a href="http://www.alternativabolivariana.org/">ALBA</a>
trade framework lead by Cuba and Venezuela. The Dow-Jones industrial
index rose over 200 points, with energy and mining stocks benefiting
most. Unofficial sources acknowledged that the controversial move stems
from the Obama administration's wider radical policy review mooted
earlier this year in the President's State of the Union address. <br>
<br>
Following
the president's announcement, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held a
joint press conference with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro
on Wednesday evening. Clinton declared, &#8220;We owe it to the people of the
United States not just to act promptly to turn the economy around as
effectively as possible but, in the longer term, to take advantage of
the proven success and resources of the ALBA model to help us rebuild
our infrastructure, regenerate disadvantaged sectors of our education
and health care systems and especially, through innovative low-cost
credit programs, to help bring new dynamism to the small and medium
sized business sectors that are the backbone of our economy. This move
is just one component of the wider package of imaginative measures
announced by the President on March 15th&#8221; <br>
<br>
Nicolas Maduro
observed, &#8220;Solidarity, cooperation and reciprocity have always been the
fundamental principles driving ALBA. While it is certainly the case
that we have plenty to offer the people of the United States, for our
part too, we are anxious to get the benefit of US business and
technological knowledge and experience, so as to better ensure
sustainable prosperity, for the countries of ALBA, certainly, but also
ultimately for all the peoples of our Americas.&#8221; Maduro confirmed that
a high-level US delegation will participate as observers at the next
ALBA summit scheduled for late May in Caracas.<br>
<br>
Among many other
leading critics of the government, former Vice-President Dick Cheney
has bitterly condemned the Obama administration's dramatic recent
policy changes which have seen violent reaction on the streets from
some sectors of the Cuban exile community in Florida. In an interview
on Fox News this morning Cheney argued, &#8220;This incredibly reckless and
humiliating announcement only deepens the foreign policy hole President
Obama is digging, not just for himself and his administration, but for
the whole country. In February we had the pardon of the five Cuban
heroes ....um, spies. That was followed up by direct ministerial level talks with the
Cuban government and cutbacks in the personnel necessary to adequately
sustain our crucially important sanctions regime. President Obama turns
out to have been the Manchurian Candidate, or rather, more precisely,
the Caracas-Havana candidate. This is all of a piece with Democrat
policy to sell off our country to foreigners. Remember it was Hillary
Clinton who was asked how we could get tough with China. She answered
'how d'you get tough with your banker?' A covert socialist Democrat
President betraying the United States is nothing new.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Support
for the President's announcement came from some surprising quarters.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas told CNN, &#8220;At long last we may be
getting some common sense into our country's foreign policy. And that
may mean some benefit too for the country's economy. We need to end the
fruitless damaging foreign wars and focus on the needs of our own
people here in the United States. Increased trade with Cuba and the
other ALBA countries&nbsp; - that's some 80 million people - can
only
be good for our farmers and for our crippled business sector. Cutting
back on useless expenditure will help our budget deficit and so will
ALBA investment in infrastructure, in health and education. The
concessionary terms Venezuela is proposing for their oil will also go
some way to helping us address our crazy, completely unsustainable
levels of government debt. You just have to realize that 50 per cent of
our oil from Venezuela can be paid at 2% interest over 25 years. We'd
be crazy to turn that down...&#8221;<br>
<br>
Bill Gross head of Pacific
Investment Management Company noted, &#8220;The balance of payments benefits
for the United States of any favourable deal with ALBA are likely to be
pretty positive. We'll sell more and we'll get better terms of trade
especially for our energy imports. In terms of the overall US economy
perhaps the immediate GDP difference will be quite small but the
cumulative effects in terms of goodwill in the short term could make a
dramatic positive difference to the US current account medium term with
the associated benefits that would bring, a more stable dollar, greater
faith in US Treasury paper, greater investor confidence generally. I
think we may be moving into a phase where the markets are suffering
from volatility-fatigue. After the roller coaster of recent years, a
period of greater stability and certainty should see more investors
returning both to stocks and bonds. This morning's sharp drop in the
gold price perhaps indicates something along those lines. Overall, in
market terms, I think the announcement is certainly positive&#8221;<br>
<br>
Respected currency specialist Chuck Butler of the <a href="http://www.dailypfennig.com/">Daily Pfennig</a>
remarked, &#8220;But what does that mean for the dollar, folks? The ALBA
common currency unit - the Sucre &#8211; is tagged to turn into real money
most likely in the next six to eight years. Are we getting ready to say
goodbye to the dollar? &#8230;.This could be the last time, it may be the
last time, I don't knnoooow...but seriously. I wonder if Tim Geithner
and his Treasury high finance honchos have looked as hard at this as
they might. But, as usual, that's just my opinion.... In the markets,
I'm looking at the screen and as I type, the Big Dog, the Euro, that
was snapping at the dollar's heels all last week, looks as though it's
headed back to the porch with the dollar stealing back to the 1.54
handle...&#8221;<br>
<br>
Dominique Strauss Kahn, Director General of the
International Monetary Fund gave a cautious welcome to the
announcement. &#8220;Any move by the US authorities to address the crucial
issue of the country's budget deficit is good for international
confidence and is helpful for the global economy. Whether the US system
can accommodate the less orthodox components of the ALBA model is an
open question. Still, the IMF welcomes any dialogue that contributes to
stable global markets, broader trade, responsible development and
sustainable growth.&#8221;<br>
<br>
In contrast to the neutral remarks of the
IMF, Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission,
expressed scarcely concealed scepticism about the US move. Speaking in
Brussels, Barroso observed, &#8220;It's hard to see how any deal with the
ALBA countries can be of lasting benefit to the United States. As a
long shot, it may provide some short term relief for the US budget
deficit and the oil component of the trade deficit. But in the broader
picture I view the decision to open negotiations with the ALBA
countries with some concern. The move seems to run counter to our joint
efforts with the United States and other countries to consolidate the
role of the International Monetary Fund and of the Financial Stability
Board.&#8221;<br>
<br>
By contrast, Congresswoman Maxine Waters emphasized the
positive impact on employment in the United States. &#8220;It's long past
time in this country for the government to make getting people back to
work the very highest priority. Last month the BLS unemployment figures
printed at 12 per cent. We cannot just abandon ordinary people in this
way. I don't know the details of the discussions so far with the ALBA
countries, but I do know we can't just carry on the failed pro-Wall
Street policies that many people hope can now at long last be reversed.
Larry Summers' departure as the President's Chief Economic Adviser last
month makes me think we have a real chance now of prioritizing
America's working people over the banksters who got us into this mess.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Many
observers suggested that President Obama's decision to fire Larry
Summers, referred to by Congresswoman Waters, would mean a bigger role
for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. In fact, President
Obama stunned Washington insiders by setting up a collegiate advisory
group made up of Dean Baker of the <a href="http://www.cepr.net/">Centre
for Economic and Policy Research,</a> <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/">Nouriel Roubini</a>,
Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business at NYU and the
widely respected financial commentator&nbsp; <a href="http://henryckliu.com/">Henry C.K.Liu</a>.
Progressive economist <a href="http://www.michael-hudson.com/">Michael
Hudson</a>,
commented, &#8220;This augurs well for long overdue structural reforms in the
US financial system. The question is how to make our market system work
for the majority? How do you halt the drive towards debt-peonage and a
toll-booth economy, and not just halt it but turn it around? The move
towards possible US membership of ALBA makes sense in terms of
increasing the kinds of tools available to the government to address
its crippling deficits. But it won't count for much without other
budget-focused measures, like cutting back our insane military
spending.&#8221;<br>
<br>
US civil society organizations expressed delight and
disbelief at President Obama's decision. Medea Benjamin of San
Francisco based Global Exchange opined, &#8220;Finally we are seeing the true
potential of this Obama administration. Clearly much of the credit for
this potentially epoch making decision to start talks about US
membership of ALBA must go to tireless organizing and mobilization of
grass roots opinion by civil society here in the US. But it's also an
encouraging high-level recognition that times have changed and we as a
country need to adapt to a more sustainable and participatory way of
handling not just our economic problems but our international relations
as a whole. President Obama's decision means we may still be in time
not just to catch up with the most creative economic model in the world
today but to contribute to shaping it into a model that is truly
global.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Among Latin American political leaders comment tended
towards agreeable surprise. Brazilian President Ignacio da Silva,
hailed President Obama's announcement as &#8220;a brave decision with huge
implications for all of Latin America.&#8221; President Alvaro Uribe of
Colombia said in Bogotá, &#8220;We welcome this sign of US commitment to
Latin America. Of course we have our reservations. But so far things
are at a very preliminary stage and we expect the US government to
engage with the ALBA countries in a way that will emphasize
reciprocity. The ALBA countries stand to benefit hugely from the kinds
of changes engagement with the United States may entail. Let's see what
results from the upcoming negotiations.&#8221; Just a few days ago,
Venezuela's President Chavez had declared on a special edition of his
legendary &#8220;Aló Presidente&#8221; programme, &#8220;the next few days may bring an
interesting surprise for all of us.&#8221; Stay tuned.<br>
