Unida Nicaragua Triunfa</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../www.tortillaconsal.com/images/bandera_nacional.jpg.html" /></p>

<p><strong>POSITION OF NICARAGUA<br />
AT THE SESSION OF THE PERMANENT COUNCIL OF THE OAS</strong></p>

<p>Honorable President of the Permanent Council of the OAS</p>

<p>Honorable Representatives of the Member States and Governments of our America.</p>

<p>“Independence, sovereignty and national self-determination are inalienable rights of the people and foundations of the Nicaraguan nation. Any foreign interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua or any attempt to undermine those rights, threatens the life of the people. It is the duty of all Nicaraguans to preserve and defend these rights."</p>

<p>Dear Representatives:</p>

<p>The above is not a discursive resource, nor an open and imaginary literary production... NO ladies and gentlemen, it is the full text of the Constitutional Norm, in its 1st article that governs, shelters and guides the minds and hearts of each and every Nicaraguan. This is the Legal-Political framework that determines the scope of our participation in this Forum, or Permanent Council of the OAS.</p>

<p>But to clarify - if the above cannot be clearly understood - take due note that, “National sovereignty resides in the people that exercises it through democratic instruments; freely deciding and participating in the construction and improvement of the economic, political, cultural and social system of the nation. Sovereign power is exercised by the people through their representatives freely elected by universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage, without any other person or group of people being able to claim this representation”; these are not empty words, verbal flourish or dead text, invalid and forgotten.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: this is the initial part of the 2nd article, of the very same Political Constitution. This is the Law in my country, and every honest, free, brave and above all, <strong>PROFOUNDLY PATRIOTIC</strong> citizen knows it.</p>

<p>Today the distinguished delegates of most of OurAmerican States are summoned to meet and debate, upon a set of assumptions, proposals, plans and mechanisms, which directly attack the national sovereignty of Nicaragua. Our Country has never accepted, does not accept, and will never accept, any action that aim to degrade its Freedom, as an Independent State, a condition which we have held since our national independence, 200 years ago.</p>

<p>We have maintained this firm and constant position of national honor on several occasions, in multiple sessions of the OAS, the UN, NAM, CELAC, among others, because the scope of our democracy does not allow any State, much less and Organization such as the OAS, to intervene in a rude, unfriendly, illegal and unconstitutional way in our internal affairs.</p>

<p>We have been clear and straightforward at different times and we hold those concepts unchanged. Therefore, no one should intervene in the direction of our Institutional Life. Our Rule of Law is solid, and exercise sovereignty to the fullest in defense of our institutions, through laws, duly approved by the competent legislative bodies and very clear judicial procedures, which provide the basis for the observance of the procedural rights of all indicted persons.</p>

<p>Dear Delegates:</p>

<p>In our country there is not a single detained candidate, <strong>NOT ONE</strong>, not a single innocent is prosecuted, <strong>NOT ONE</strong>, those who are being subjected to legal processes, are foreign agents, plainly identified within the payrolls of foreign governments; who using the structures of private organizations, received millions of dollars to destroy, kill, bankrupt the economy and subvert the Constitutional order. In Nicaragua, since 1979, this constitutes a crime against humanity, and it is punished with determination, since it affects the life of the common citizen, who is the main victim, the attacked, the injured. Those that today face the weight of the laws, are not Church Doves, they are instigators, murderers and destroyers. For less than that, in many of their States, their Laws would apply very serious penalties. Without greater presumption, or norm other than the so-called Patriotic Laws.</p>

<p>The actions that violate the Principles of Non-Interference in the affairs of other States and that of Respect for Self-determination and Sovereignty for each People, and above all, Respect for the Life of those Peoples; does not give us license to qualify Anybody’s institutional Internal Process, much less to channel it, through false media manipulations and pressures, toward events that led or lead toward deaths and coup d'états. We Nicaraguans believe that a thorough review of the immediate past of highest authorities of this OAS Organization places them very badly in the face of History, and above all, in the face of the victims of all the abuses and violations of the Sovereignty of those Peoples.<br />
<br />
In Nicaragua, more than 12 Political Parties participate in the Elections, ALL of them participated in the formulation of the Electoral Reforms, openly discussed during the stages of the law formation process. The Parties that excluded themselves did so voluntarily. One party said that they would not present Candidates. That is cause for immediate dissolution based on the law. Another made de facto alliances, with structures not authorized by their own instances and at the request of their leaders, said alliance was canceled. In another case, its highest authority, was a foreign citizen, when based on the Nicaraguan Constitution, since 1987, foreigners do not have Political Party institutional Rights. Its actions, therefore, were declared invalid, because from nullity, no right is born.</p>

<p>Currently, progress is being made in the stages prior to November 7. Citizens have been verified in their Voting Centers, 100% of the citizens eligible to vote are registered, nearly 14,000 voting stations have been established, and in a campaign with a lot of precautions because of the pandemic, the process moves forward and will not stop.</p>

<p>The Parties and Alliances have already presented their Candidates, and their proposals for the integration of the Voting Stations, as well as for the accreditation of their Monitors. The country advances with determination, confidence, united, and always victorious. There is NO reason why any State of our America should doubt the Patriotism and Democratic Spirit of our People.</p>

<p>Nicaragua, demands with respect, but with the authority that we work within our own Model of Life; with the Democratic Spirit that governs the Life of our Peoples. We firmly declare that our Sovereignty is not disputed, that it is written, not in ink but in blood, throughout history. In this Victorious October, Month of our great Benjamin Zeledón, Illustrious Father of the Nation, who in his death enlightened the greatest Hero of The Segovias, A.C. Sandino, we simply express that we are a Free, Sovereign, Honest, Worthy, Peace Loving People, we Respect the Right to Self-determination of all Peoples and are essentially Fighters for Life.</p>

<p>In this framework, and given our considerations of respect for those Delegates who, if they truly understand that the Peoples of Our America deserve to be treated with Integrity and Respect; we have chosen NOT TO PARTICIPATE in this Session, since a single expression of injury toward our Sovereignty, does not deserve to be heard.  </p>
