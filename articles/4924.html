<p><strong>MORE AND BETTER SERVICE<br />
FOR OUR HEROIC PEOPLE</strong></p>

<p>This week we have been making progress continuing the process of reordering so as to ensure greater responsiveness of the Government of the People-as-President, with regard to the following points:</p>

<p>1. The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, through the Office of the Municipal Prosecutor, ensures prompt, timely and effective management of Municipal Offices throughout the country, in the service of our Families and Communities.</p>

<p>Streets, Roads, Houses, Cultural Centers, Trade Skills Schools, Arts Schools, in Urban Areas and in the Countryside, among many other Solutions to needs. But also, parks for enjoyment and recreation; Markets and grounds for Special Market activities, all that is advancing everywhere.</p>

<p>Services ensuring Community Drinking Water, that too is advancing everywhere, even more... We want to advance more and more, faster and more efficiently, above all, because we know that serving our People is serving our Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>2. ENACAL has assumed the work of FISE, and assumes, in an integral way, the Drinking Water and Sanitation Plans for the Urban and Rural Areas of our Blessed Nicaragua.</p>

<p>3. What we used to know as the “Secretariat for Climate Change" is now incorporated into MARENA, incorporating this important role at the level of the Vice-Ministry of that Entity, and attending to all Demands and Emergencies, derived from the indispensable care and protection of our Natural Heritage.</p>

<p>4. SINAPRED continues to be deployed throughout the country, organizing with greater coverage and capacity to respond, via community surveillance and management so as to address, in the best possible conditions, the risks of disasters and calamities in any region of our Nicaragua. We are, as we know, a country of high risk, a seismic and volcanic zone, and also at high risk due to the consequences of human voracity that has generated what we euphemistically call Climate Change.</p>

<p>SINAPRED and COMUPRED, as well as the entire Management and Civil Defense System against Threats and Risks, continue to prepare the III National Practice Exercise, addressing the real possibility of disasters; a Prevention Exercise for the Protection of Life. We will hold it on Thursday, September 26th.</p>

<p>5. The Ministry of Health and the National Health System continue with permanent Immunization Campaigns and we ensure care, promptly and attentively, to those who are confirmed with any of the viruses that threaten us, as humanity.</p>

<p>The National Health System continues to generate the best conditions for the care of our People, via Special Events, Mobile Clinics, Health posts, Health Centers, Hospitals, with the Specialties that allow us to achieve coverage and permanent protection for Individuals, for Families and for Communities.</p>

<p>6. The National Education Strategy continues to be presented and established throughout the Country, with New Proposals and Initiatives in all the Modalities, so that we achieve better Quality and more Coverage for the close of 2024 and start of 2025.</p>

<p>7. In Telecommunications, we are making progress creating new Networks, new spaces as well, new Modalities for Television in its different expressions, as well as Local Radio Stations that respond to the daily exercise of our Dignity, Freedom and Rights.</p>

<p>8. Every day we inaugurate Electrical Energy for Families and Communities in remote parts of our Nation, and we ensure Public Lighting Systems, as well as more spaces for the Trees of Life which identify us so much, shining with the Light of our Combative People.</p>

<p>9. INTUR, which is already installing the Week of our Patriotic Nation, as a Week of Enjoyment too, not just of Patriotic Love, but for Patriotic Love and Family Enjoyment, presenting the New Laws made possible by Innovative Strategies, both Nationally and Internationally, prioritizing Technologies and Communication Platforms able to offer our Nicaragua more directly as a Safe and always Beautiful Destination.</p>

<p>10. MEFCCA continues to review its operations so as to ensure all the Programs we are promoting and carrying out via the successful Model of Solidarity Groups, with the aim of strengthening Urban and Rural businesses, in effective formats with both national and local coordination.</p>

<p>11. The Secretariat of Creative Economy and Innovation, in coordination with the Municipal Authorities and the Institute of Culture, Youth and Peoples, is promoting ever more activities for us to connect with our proud Identity and Culture in these New Times, preserving the best of what defines us as a People and also creating things anew, for more Preparation and Harvest of Victories.</p>

<p>12. The Seminars and Workshops that facilitate knowledge of Information and Communication Technologies multiply thanks to the participation of International Agencies of Peoples and Governments of Dignity, preparing all of us together so as to ensure, via Fraternal Cooperation, more harmony with the struggles of the World with the Sensitivity and National Culture of the Combative People of Darío and Sandino.</p>

<p>Just this weekend we have a Special Seminar with the participation of Communicators and Experts from many Countries. What is the topic? Communication Platforms or Intelligence Agencies. How do we take on this challenge? We learn... We learn every day to insert ourselves into this vertiginous World of threats but also of the affirmation of Human Dignity.</p>

<p>More Seminars and workshops will continue to be held, to promote more and better communication practices.</p>

<p>13. The Nicaraguan Army celebrates next Week, September 2nd and 3rd, the Acts and Events Commemorating the Glorious 45th Anniversary of its Foundation and its Service to Nicaraguan Families, protecting every aspect of our Sovereign Security.</p>

<p>14. The National Police and the Ministry of the Interior continue working together to achieve more Victories for Peace, Citizen Security and the Joy of the Common Good.</p>

<p>We celebrate the Glorious 45th Anniversary of both Entities, next October, commemorating the feat of the Victorious Insurrection.</p>

<p>15. We have updated, under Presidential Instructions, the Decrees and indispensable Laws, which guarantee Security, Peace, the Fight against Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime, and the permanent protection of our Rights, of our Patrimony, Material, Cultural, Heroic and Human.</p>

<p>In broad strokes, and in summary, this is what we have worked on this Week to strengthen our Institutions' Service to our People. What we call Public Service. We are Public Servants, we are the Servants of Nicaragua's Families, and strengthening this capacity for service is our permanent task and furthermore our Vocation. Because we were born, as the Sandinista National Liberation Front, to serve our People, to combat Poverty, to advance against Poverty, to defeat Poverty and, All Together, to take that Step Always Further On of our Undefeated General, General of Free Men and Women, Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino.</p>
