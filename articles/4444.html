<blockquote>
<p>Note:  There has been a great deal of inaccurate and biased reporting about Nicaragua written in support of regime change and presenting a false narrative of what occurred in the Nicaraguan uprising. The article below is about a self-trained reporter, <span id="m_2886457825312267908yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1538915655377_18227">Carl David Goette Luciak, who was the source of consistently biased reporting which had an agenda — provide support for the violent US-funded coup. He regularly wrote for</span> The Guardian, an outlet that continues to be<span id="m_2886457825312267908yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1538915655377_18227"> consistently biased in its coverage. </span></p>

<p><span id="m_2886457825312267908yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1538915655377_18227">Earlier this year after trying to get a letter published in The Guardian people wrote an Open Letter to the Guardian about their poor reporting. <a href="https://popularresistance.org/guardian-criticized-on-nicaragua/">The letter cited numerous instances</a> of The Guardian failing to report the violence of the opposition and presenting an inaccurate narrative.  Carl David Goette Luciak was specifically mentioned in the Open Letter which stated: </span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="m_2886457825312267908yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1538915655377_18227">“<span>The author of several articles, Carl David Goette-Luciak, openly associates with opposition figures. On July 5 he blamed the police for the terrible house fire in Managua three weeks earlier, relying largely on assertions from government opponents. Yet videos appearing to show police presence were actually taken on April 21, before barricades were erected to prevent police entering the area.”</span></span></p>

<p><span id="m_2886457825312267908yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1538915655377_18227"><span>After the Open Letter was published <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/27/opposition-behind-the-violence-in-nicaragua">the Guardian published a short version of the letter</a> followed by a series of letters opposing the Nicaraguan government.</span></span></p>

<p><span id="m_2886457825312267908yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1538915655377_18227"><span>Even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/nicaragua-deports-reporter-who-covered-anti-ortega-protests">when Luciak was deported The Guardian took a one-sided view</a> of the situation never mentioning the biased nature of his reporting, his ties to the violent opposition and they used his deportation to again falsely report the alleged “state of repression” of the Ortega government. Luciak, from Blacksburg, Virginia (the bible belt of rural Virginia) was suspected by people as working for the CIA (which his family denies) because his reporting always supported the attempted violent coup.</span></span></p>

<p>Luciak was lucky he was deported and not prosecuted criminally in Nicaragua as he arguably aided and abetted torture and bloodshed by not reporting on the perpetrators. The article below focuses on his failure to report torture.</p>

In this video the terrorists are walking along torturing an old man who they accused of being a Sandinista – they call Sandinistas toads and cockroaches; they mark their homes and tell people not to buy at their businesses. And they kidnap, torture and kill them. Luciak was right there as the torture was taking place and he shows up in the video at various points.</span></div>

Everything he wrote was rabidly anti-Sandinista. Why would the Guardian, the Washington Post, the BBC and NPR print his work?  There are many very knowledgeable journalists writing about Nicaragua but the mainstream media won’t print their work because they tell the truth – they don’t follow what has come to be the accepted narrative on Nicaragua in the “developed world”.</span></div>
