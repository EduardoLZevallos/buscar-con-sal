              Tortilla con Sal, September 13th 2011</span><i><br>
              <br>
              Tortilla con Sal : Nicaragua's 2007 development plan
              worked out by the government had various aims, principally
              promoting economic growth, promoting employment, reducing
              inequality and reducing poverty levels. Here we are now
              towards the end of 2011, nearly five years on. What have
              been the results?</i>&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Dr. Paul Oquist: Well, the result is that the economy has
            grown. Nicaragua had the least hit from the great world
            depression. Our economy decreased by 1.5% in 2009 which
            compares with 1.9% for Central America in general. And
            Nicaragua has had the best recovery, 4.5% in 2010. As a
            matter of fact, Nicaragua in 2010 has the highest growth
            rate in Central America. 4.5% as compared to 4.2% in Costa
            Rica, 2.8% in&nbsp; Honduras, 2.6% in Guatemala and 0.6% in
            El Salvador. Nicaragua has done that with single digit
            inflation. <br>
            <b><br>
              Exports and investments</b><br>
            <br>
            And this has been driven by an enormous increase in exports.
            We've had our exports increase by 32% last year and through
            the 31st of August they've increased by 28% this year. So
            exports are growing over the last two years on average by
            30% a year. In fact, this economy is completely different to
            what it was in 2006 because exports have doubled. <br>
            <br>
            There was US$1,043,900,000 exported in 2006. But through
            August 31st of this year we had US$580 million more exports
            than in the entire year of 2006. So our exports are going to
            be more than double this year.<br>
            <br>
            So this has been accompanied now also by an investment boom
            on top of the export boom. Before 2007, foreign direct
            investment in Nicaragua never reached US$300 million. After
            2007 it has never dropped below US$300 million. Last year it
            was US$508 million which was an increase of 17%. This year
            it's going to be about US$850 million which is an increase
            of 67% in foreign direct investment. <br>
            <br>
            So we have exports and investments driving the economy when
            the biggest investments are still not on line. So next year
            investments will reach the level of a billion dollars and
            stay there for several years at least. That's due to the
            150,000 barrels a day refinery in which US$190 million is
            being invested this year. But this project is worth between
            US$4 billion and US$5 billion and that will be executed in
            the next five years. Then in electrical energy we have
            US$2.6 billion of approved projects that are going to more
            than double generating capacity in the country. <br>
            <br>
            Datcom Mobile from China is going to invest US$3 billion to
            US$4 billion in Nicaragua and begin its Central American
            manufacturing operation in Nicaragua. There's a lot of talk
            about Chinese investment only being in natural resources,
            but in Nicaragua it's going to be in manufacturing. <br>
            <br>
            Andrade Gutierrez a Brazilian construction firm has signed a
            Memorandum of Understanding that it will undertake the
            feasibility studies for the port on the Caribbean Coast
            because Nicaragua doesn't have a port there. <br>
            <br>
            There's a US$250 million tourism project Guacalito de la
            Isla in Rivas. Then Walmart which already operates here is
            expanding its operations by US$54 million. Cargill which is
            in the chicken business here will expand by US$28 million.
            Sucarne which is a Mexican firm is going to be investing
            US$50 million and then US$50 million in a second phase to
            export Nicaraguan beef to Mexico. And so on ..... <br>
            <br>
            We have this enormous 67% increase this year in investment
            and this is in an election year in Latin America which is
            not supposed to happen. There's supposed to be a lot of
            trepidation and uncertainty, which is not the case in
            Nicaragua because there's a great expression of confidence
            in the leadership of Comandante Daniel Ortega as President
            of the Republic, in the policies the government has been
            following, in the good relations with the private sector and
            in the great alliance between workers, the business sector
            and government. This has allowed the country to agree over
            the last two years by consensus on the minimum wage
            increase.<br>
            <b><br>
              More employment, lower poverty </b><br>
            <br>
            Now you asked whether this growth is producing results in
            terms of increasing employment and reducing poverty. Between
            2006 and the 30th of June this year the number of people
            employed has gone from 2,089,000 to 2,833,000an increase of
            744,000 more people employed than in 2006. That's an
            increase of 35%. <br>
            <br>
            Now a lot of this is in the informal sector. It's people who
            are self-employed. It's people who are small subsistence
            farmers., because that's the structure of the Nicaraguan
            economy. But it's not true that what's called formal
            employment with social security, with full benefits has not
            increased. That has increased from 420,000 in 2006 to
            581,000 through June 30th this year. So that's an increase
            of 161,000 or 38.5%, even more than the increase in
            employment in general.<br>
            <br>
            We can appreciate this in a study by the Economic Commission
            for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the United
            Nations agency based in Santiago, Chile. This shows that in
            regard to the increase in formal employment, employment
            covered by social security between January 2008 and March
            2011 in countries that stimulated their economies, that took
            counter-cyclical measures, Nicaragua is the country that had
            the highest increase in employment. Higher than Chile,
            Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay and Costa Rica. <br>
            <br>
            So employment has increased. What about poverty? The
            official poverty data comes from the Household Standard of
            Living Survey which was conducted in 2001, 2005 and
            2009.&nbsp; And what this shows is that general poverty
            decreased from 48.3%. After having increased between 2001
            and 2005, it decreased from 48.3% to 42.5%.<br>
            <br>
            With regard to chronic malnutrition, that has also been
            reduced. Extreme poverty which increased from 15.1% in 2001
            to 17.2% in 2005 has decreased to 14.6% in 2009. According
            to FIDEG, a private think-tank, in a study financed by the
            Netherlands and Switzerland with technical assistance from
            the World Bank, their study shows that extreme poverty has
            been reduced by even more, to 9.7%. And they did a follow-up
            study this year which says the drop continues. It went down
            to 9%.<br>
            <br>
            There are three ways to measure poverty, consumption, income
            and basic needs. All three measures show that poverty has
            decreased in Nicaragua and this is so in the official
            figures and in the unofficial figures. In fact, the
            unofficial figures show a greater drop in the levels of
            poverty. Why did that happen? How did that happen in the
            midst of great financial and economic crisis in 2007, 2008
            and 2009?<br>
            <br>
            <b>Falling inequality</b><br>
            <br>
            Well, it happened because in Nicaragua there were policies
            that redistributed income, Christian, socialist and
            solidarity based policies as we call them here that
            redistributed income. Here we
            see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nicaragua has had an
            extremely unequal society - in 2005 the top 20% consumed
            47.2% of all goods and services compared to 6.2% for the
            bottom 20%. We can even add another 20%, make it the bottom
            40% and their consumption still only comes to 16.5%, very
            far from the 47.2% of consumption by the top 20%. <br>
            <br>
            Let's add on another 20% to make it the bottom 60% of the
            population. Even adding that this group's consumption still
            only comes out at 31.2% still far away from the 47.2% of the
            top 20%. An extremely unequal society within the most
            unequal region in the world, Latin America and the
            Caribbean. International organizations like ECLAC and the
            United Nations and like the International Labour
            Organization and the UNDP, all point out that inequality is
            one of the reasons why the Latin American economies cannot
            grow faster and develop faster is because wealth is too
            concentrated.<br>
            <br>
            But in 2009 the percentage of consumption by the top 20% had
            been reduced to 44.5% while the bottom 20%'s consumption
            increased from 6.2% to 6.8% and that's also the case if we
            look at the bottom 40%, 60%, even if we go to 80% there's an
            increase, although a smaller increase. So there has been a
            reduction of poverty in Nicaragua due to redistribution via
            government policies which have led to redistribution in this
            society. <br>
            <br>
            And we can see the result of this based on information also
            from ECLAC. Venezuela is the country that has most decreased
            inequality by 15% between 2005 and 2009. Nicaragua was the
            second country in the region, decreasing inequality by 9.8%.
            Then came Brazil due to President Lula's policies, with over
            6%. Then Ecuador another ALBA country by 5.8%. Whereas by
            contrast our neighbour Costa Rica unfortunately came out of
            the recession with more inequality with 6.6% more
            inequality.<br>
            <br>
            So Nicaragua is one of the two leaders with Venezuela in
            reducing inequality so as to reduce poverty. And this
            inequality is not only inequality in terms of consumptions
            and income, but also in terms of gender. That increase in
            employment we spoke of before between 2010 and 2011 the
            increase in employment was 19.6% for women as compared to 9%
            for men. Women in Nicaragua have a lower level of economic
            participation than men. But that inequality, that gap, is
            being closed by these redistributive policies.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Successful policies and programmes</b><br>
            <br>
            And two reasons for that are the programmes which explicitly
            target increasing women's economic participation like the
            Zero Hunger program in which poor rural women are given the
            means to produce, inseminated cows and pigs, chickens.
            They're given agricultural implements, materials to build
            corrals for the animals. So now 100,000 women have become
            producers through this programme. And in the cities 217,000
            loans have been made to women formed in solidarity credit
            groups in which all the women members are responsible for
            all the loans to the group and they use these loans for
            small commercial or artisan activity.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Another factor in this poverty reduction has been the use of
            subsidies for the poorest people. For example the people who
            use the bus in Managua have a two c&oacute;rdoba (US$0.09
            cents) subsidy every time they ride the bus. For a family of
            five using the bus twice a day that's a 600 c&oacute;rdoba
            (US$26.60) subsidy each month. People get a 100
            c&oacute;rdoba (US$4.44) subsidy for people making&nbsp;
            minimal use of water. <br>
            <br>
            People who consume less than 150Kw of electricity each month
            get a 300 c&oacute;rdoba (US$13.30) subsidy. If they buy
            their food at private stores supplied by the government food
            distribution company for just trade, they save another 375
            c&oacute;rdobas (US$16.67) and the people on the lowest
            incomes working in the public sector get a 700
            c&oacute;rdoba (US$31.11) bond, called the Christian,
            Socialist, Solidarity bond to supplement their income.<br>
            <br>
            All those add up to 2075 c&oacute;rdobas a month, which for
            a family of five people represents 41.5% of their income at
            the 5000 c&oacute;rdoba a month income level. So these
            subsidies are very significant also in terms of
            redistributing wealth. Another very significant
            redistribution of wealth has been that in the previous 16
            years governments got into cost recovery for health and
            education, violating the Nicaraguan Constitution. Because
            Article 121 of the Constitution states that Nicaraguans have
            the right to free universal primary and secondary education.<br>
            <br>
            Article 105 of the Nicaraguan Constitution says that
            Nicaraguans have the right to free universal health care. In
            previous governments they started charging different fees.
            In the health system they charged for lab exams, they
            charged for medicines, they charged for the materials used
            for operations and now those things are no longer charged
            for. So poor people who were excluded from education, the
            poorest people, and excluded from health care due to those
            charges, now not only have access, but people in general
            have that income at their disposal&nbsp; because government
            is now covering those costs which people were previously
            paying.<br>
            <br>
            So in sum one has the situation where growth has been
            achieved, employment has increased while inequality and
            poverty have been reduced. And this is what leads to the
            situation in Nicaragua now in which there is great optimism
            and great hope in the country, in contrast to the situation
            in much of the world in 2011 where people feel trapped by
            their economies and don't see any way out of the trap of
            their economies, for example in Greece or Portugal, Ireland,
            Spain, Italy and even in teh United States where one has a
            high unemployment rate, growth without employment creation.
            And many people do not see a way out of that morass. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Low serious crime rates and stability</b><br>
            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal. Especially over the last two years,
            Nicaragua has indeed attracted a great deal of investment,
            as you have pointed out, in terms of direct investment in
            the economy. And Nicaragua has also attracted record levels
            of tourism. One of the reasons Nicaragua has been able to
            achieve that is because it is in fact one of the safest
            countries in Central America and the Caribbean, if not the
            safest country, certainly in Central America. What factors
            do you think have contributed to that reality.<br>
            <br>
            Paul Oquist : Let's look at the data. On average on any
            given day in Guatemala there are 18 homicides, in Honduras
            17, in El Salvador 12 , in Nicaragua 2.1, in Costa Rica 1.3.
            A total of&nbsp; 44.8 homicides, of which just 2 take place
            in Nicaragua. And the homicides in Nicaragua are quite
            different from those in other countries, in the northern
            triangle as it is called. Because they don't have to do so
            much with the Colombian or Mexican drugs cartels, with
            organized crime or with the maras. <br>
            <br>
            And these other countries unfortunately have serious
            problems in that regard, so serious that the international
            community had a meeting in Guatemala in June on the issue of
            security in Central America. Because at the level of 18
            homicides a day, that's 500 a month and even if you had the
            best police force in the world 500 cases a month,
            accumulating month after month are very difficult to deal
            with. So there's a fear that impunity is setting in with
            these types of crimes as well as with extortion and
            kidnapping.<br>
            <br>
            There's only been 6 kidnappings in Nicaragua in the last
            five years and all of those cases have been cleared up.
            There hasn't been a bank robbery in Nicaragua since 2007. So
            we have a completely different situation than in the other
            countries. We like a second indicator for citizen security
            apart from homicides and that's vehicular theft. <br>
            <br>
            Any theft on the street or shoplifting or burglaries a lot
            of the time is not reported for lots of reasons. There's an
            under-registration of those types of crimes, an
            under-reporting of them. But it's very rare that someone
            loses their car or their motorcycle and doesn't report it
            immediately because they hope to get it back while it's
            still on the street and because it could be used in a
            robbery, so you have to report its theft to defend yourself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's look at last year's figures in terms of vehicular
            theft. In Guatemala, there were 8,095 thefts, in Costa Rica
            5,222, in Honduras 3,130, in El Salvador 1,035 and in
            Nicaragua 387, which seems like a different continent. In
            Costa Rica over 5000, this is our southern neighbour,
            Honduras our northern neighbour with over 3000 and Nicaragua
            sandwiched in the middle with 387.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Security and investment</b><br>
            <br>
            Now you ask the reasons for this security situation which
            definitely has influenced the boom in foreign direct
            investment and they are very explicit about this. The
            investors who were at the Investment Fair which was held
            here recently, the directors of the Pantaleon Group from
            Guatemala had mentioned that they increased their
            investments by four times in Nicaragua. They are very happy
            to be working in Nicaragua because they don't have to watch
            their back all of the time.<br>
            <br>
            Mexican investors who have arrived in Nicaragua can do
            things here that they cannot do in Acapulco, Tijuana,
            Monterey or Ciudad Juarez like walk up the street. A Mexican
            investor can't think of doing that in his home country but
            here he can walk along the street at night, go from place to
            place with no problem whatsoever. And that peace of mind is
            worth a lot. <br>
            <br>
            The reasons for these differences are that Nicaragua has the
            best and most effective army and police force in Central
            America. Why are they the best and the most effective?
            Because they have the largest budget? No. They have the
            smallest budget. Nicaragua's defence and security spending
            is US$52 million this year. <br>
            <br>
            Costa Rica spends over US$300 million, six times more than
            Nicaragua. Panama spends eight times more. The other
            countries all spend more than double what Nicaragua spends,
            in fact two to three times more. So Nicaragua has the best
            security on the lowest budget. <br>
            <br>
            The real difference is that that army and that police force
            were formed out of the revolution. So the relationships with
            the community is completely different. The police have a
            community policing policy. So when they see a group of kids
            they see youth at risk. When they see a gang in formation
            they see youth at risk, not a mara. They don't just come
            down with an iron fist. They try to work for the kids
            reintegration into the community. <br>
            <br>
            There's community counsellors, counsellors in the schools.
            The police get into contact with the youth, play baseball
            with them. They establish relationships as does the
            community in terms of youth. And in terms of the drugs
            cartels, the security forces have been very effective in
            keeping the drug cartel presence to a minimum in Nicaragua
            and so they have not been able to establish a base of
            operations in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            This is not the only factor though in relation to the
            investment boom to which that boom can be attributed. The
            growth of the economy itself is something that attracts
            investment. In Nicaragua we have the fastest growing economy
            in Central America, exports increasing by 30%. We have
            greater access to markets.<br>
            <br>
            There's the CAFTA agreement with the United States, there's
            the ALBA agreement with Venezuela Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador,
            Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadine, Antigua and
            Barbuda. Central America just concluded an agreement of
            Association with the European Union. So investors in
            Nicaragua can export to all those areas. We just just signed
            a free trade treaty with Chile so we're expanding that
            commerce. With Taiwan and with China economic relations are
            becoming stronger.<br>
            <b><br>
              Lowest cost of living</b><br>
            <br>
            There are other factors as well. For example, in the Mercer
            Cost of Living Survey &#8211; Mercer is a company based in New
            York that does a survey of 214 cities in the world in terms
            of cost of living. And Managua in Nicaragua turns out to
            have the lowest cost of living in Latin America. The highest
            cost of living in Latin America is Sao Paulo, which is
            number ten at the world level. Out of 214 in the world,
            Managua in Nicaragua is 213th. It has the lowest cost of
            living in Latin America. And at 214 with the lowest cost of
            living in the world in the Mercer survey was Karachi in
            Pakistan. <br>
            <br>
            This has led to US News and World Report based on a highly
            accredited retirement newsletter saying in November of last
            year that Nicaragua was the best place in the world to
            retire on a low budget. So here you have this beautiful
            country of lakes and volcanoes and great tourist attractions
            and with the lowest cost of living in Latin America. Or if
            you look at Lonely Planet this year, it states that
            Nicaragua is one of the two best locations in the world for
            a low cost vacation, the other being Bangladesh. But
            Bangladesh is a little bit further from Miami airport than
            Managua and the cultural adaptation might be a little bit
            more difficult in Bangladesh than in Managua.<br>
            <br>
            Then we have other factors like the fact there's this great
            alliance, as it is called here, between&nbsp; workers,
            business people and government which is reaching agreements
            to strengthen our economy. So for example in the free trade
            zone there has been an agreement reached by consensus of
            what the minimum wage is going to be for 2011, 2012 and
            2013. This makes labour costs predictable and provides great
            stability to labour costs. <br>
            <br>
            And here too there is peace and security. And one of the
            reasons why there is peace and security is because there is
            social justice. There are programmes so people can see the
            transformation that year upon year society is becoming less
            unequal, poverty is being reduced, opportunities are being
            given to the poorest elements in society through programmes
            like Zero Hunger and Zero Usury which we mentioned before.
            These programmes are allowing very poor women to become
            producers, to become economically active- So there is this
            social justice which also leads to peace and stability which
            is very attractive to investors. </td>
