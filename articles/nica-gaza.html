The
final results of Nicaragua's local elections have now been declared
after much confusion caused by an unprecedented campaign of disruption
by the biggest losing opposition party, the Partido Liberal
Constitucionalista. Five political parties contested the elections. The
results for 146 municipalities give the Unida Nicaragua Triunfa
coalition led by the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional a total
of 105 municipalities. The PLC won 37 and the smaller Alianza Liberal
Nicaragüense won 4. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The elections were held on Sunday
November 9th and passed off quietly, as is habitual in Nicaragua. But
even before the first results began to be announced, the PLC candidate
in the capital Managua was claiming massive fraud had denied him
victory. International election observers from groups representing
countries from all over Latin America contradicted that claim stating
that the elections were well-organized, free and fair. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nicaragua's
Supreme Electoral Council is composed of the same magistrates who
oversaw the PLC presidential election victory in 2001, the municipal
elections won overwhelmingly by the FSLN in 2004 and the FSLN
presidential election victory in 2006. The Nicaraguan right-wing
parties accepted those elections without demurral. The Supreme
Electoral Council, an independent power of the State, is composed of
three magistrates nominated by the PLC, three by the FSLN and its
president, who is not identified with either party.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Following
the election the PLC opposition staged marches and protests,
deliberately provoking FSLN supporters and attacking Sandinista
journalists. In<br>
response, FSLN supporters took to the streets en
masse and forced the cancellation of various opposition marches in León
and Managua. Dozens of demonstrators from both sides, as well as
police, were injured. The announcement of the final results was made,
apparently, in part to end uncertainty after the PLC party
representatives had tried delaying tactics to extend the post electoral
count process and thus throw doubt on the elections' legitimacy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These
municipal elections are the second time over the last two years that
Nicaraguans have served up what the imperialist powers of North America
and Europe regard as the wrong result. The national and international
propaganda response has been overwhelming. Local media, dominated by
the right wing and its social democrat allies, relentlessly attacked
the electoral authority. Their message, as usual, was taken up and
magnified many times by the international press. Spain's, El País, for
example called for foreign intervention.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Much of the media
parroted basic falsehoods. The BBC news web site and the Radio
Netherlands Worldwide web site (1), for example, both falsely reported
that the government had refused to allow election observers. A double
falsehood since the Supreme Electoral Council is independent of the
government and did in fact invite election observers from all over
Latin America via organizations of professional electoral specialists
representing the electoral authorities of around a dozen Latin American
countries - the Protocolo de Tikal group, the Protocolo de Quito group
and the Council of Latin American Electoral Experts.(2)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
An
excellent example of hateful anti-Sandinista propaganda turned up on
the pages of the Independent written by John Carlin, notorious for his
fact-free coverage of Venezuela. At the centre of Carlin's piece one
finds exactly the same blatant falsehoods that figure in the rest of
the Western Bloc media's anti-Sandinista propaganda campaign. Carlin
writes ""Mr Ortega prevented international observers from overseeing
the elections and ensured that the<br>
Supreme Electoral Council was entirely in Sandinista hands." (3)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The
rest of his article is an opinion piece regurgitating the poisonous
propaganda of social democrat soul mates who have openly allied
themselves with the right wing opposition party run by Arnoldo Aleman,
the corrupt PLC strongman convicted of multi-million dollar corruption.
Almost all the individuals cited or mentioned by Carlin, for example
Sergio Ramirez, Gioconda Belli or Carlos Fernando Chamorro, are
politically, morally and intellectually discredited inside Nicaragua
among the great majority of the population. All formerly leading
Sandinistas, they are reduced to a tiny, unrepresentative but
privileged clique, serving the propaganda needs of the local oligarchy
and supportive foreign powers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It seems absurd that
elections in a small country like Nicaragua should be of any concern to
the great imperialist powers. The contrast could hardly be greater
between the huge imperialist country propaganda campaign on behalf of
the losing Nicaraguan opposition and the studied indifference to the
vast fraud committed in Mexico in 2006. That fraud denied Mexico's PRD
opposition candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador victory in that year'
presidential election. But Lopez Obrador's mobilization of millions of
supporters for months in protest at that blatant electoral fraud was
treated with studied indifference by the North American and European
corporate media.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In fact, one has to look beyond Nicaragua
to understand the significance of the current extraordinary
international propaganda assault. Political projects sponsored by the
US government and its allies have this year been defeated in Ecuador
and Bolivia. In Venezuela next week, the government and its allies are
likely to win another overwhelming victory similar to that of the FSLN
in Nicaragua on November 9th. In El Salvador, the left wing FMLN party
is well ahead in opinion polls prior to the presidential elections
there in March 2009. If the FMLN win, they will immediately incorporate
El Salvador into the ALBA solidarity-based trade and cooperation
treaty, led by Venezuela and Cuba.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It is an open question
how far the US government and its European allies will go to obstruct
that development. One obvious way is to send a very clear message to
the El Salvadoran electorate by cutting aid to Nicaragua on the pretext
of lack of democracy. The UK Guardian's Latin America correspondent,
Rory Carroll, reported in an article in October "Several European
governments are preparing to axe tens of millions of dollars in aid"
(4) in response to government attempts to control aid donations being
channelled to an opposition political party. To date, no such cuts have
been made.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The clearest recent precedent for such measures
is Gaza. When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian Authority elections, the
US government and its European allies<br>
refused to accept the result
and worked ceaselessly to destroy the Hamas government. Eventually,
funding was cut and Gaza was subjected to a grotesque re-enactment of
medieval siege tactics by Israel, actively supported by the governments
of the United States and the European Union. The message was clear. A
democratic vote for candidates rejected by the US and European
governments will lead to destructive measures aimed at the broader
population - in other words collective punishment, illegal under
international humanitarian law.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Now, it remains to be seen whether the US government and its European
allies<br>
will
use the bogus pretext of electoral fraud in Nicaragua to punish the
Nicaraguan people by withdrawing hundreds of millions of dollars of
development aid. If they do, the self evident intent will be to deepen
their efforts to destabilise the Nicaraguan government and to send a
very strong message to voters in El Salvador about how they should vote
next March, if they know what's good for them. It is hard to know who
are more pathetic and contemptible - the rich-country politicians and
diplomats who promote this interventionist gangsterism or the
innumerable media shills like John Carlin, Rory Carroll and their
editors who cover it up under a fact-free propaganda gloss.<br>
