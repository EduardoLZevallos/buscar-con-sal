      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">Paul
Oquist Kelley, Secretary of
National Policy for the Nicaraguan Presidency, represented the
Nicaraguan government in the UN Summit about the Millenium
Development Goals which took place last week at the UN General
Assembly, New York. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">As
part of his speech, Oquist gave
details about the achievements in terms of poverty reduction and
wealth redistribution in Nicaragua since Daniel Ortega's government
took office in 2007. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">Oquist
also emphasized the
Nicaraguan government's position that, in order for the Millenium
Development Goals to be achieved at a global level, it is necessary
to immediately begin transforming the financial, economic and
political power structures currently imposed on the world. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;">At the
same time, Oquist described
ALBA as a model to be imitated around the globe as part of the
struggle to make social justice a realistic objective. </span><br style="font-family: serif;">
      <br style="font-family: serif;">
      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: serif;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </div>
      <br style="font-family: serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">To fulfill the Millenium
Development Goals [MDGs] it is not only necessary to resolve
technical, administrative, financial problems and problems regarding
political will, but also to confront structural challenges including
the very nature of the current economic and social model which
concentrates income and wealth in very few hands. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This tendency has become
more acute
since 1980 with the rise of neoliberalism and the Washington
consensus which have imposed deregulation, privatization and the
minimization of the State including its role as redistributer. </span>
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The consequence of these
policies has
been greater inequality between and within countries, something
particularly relevant to Latin America and the Caribbean which is the
most unequal region in the world. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The same tendencies have
also affected
developed countries, though. Indeed working class families in the US
had, on average, a greater real income in 1980 than they do today, a
situation which generates imbalances that contributed to the current
financial and economic crisis. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In Nicaragua, extreme
poverty increased
between 2001 and 2005. Since 2007, however, the government of
President Daniel Ortega has been able to reduce extreme poverty
despite the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great
Depression. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Nicaraguan
government's figure
shows that, at present, 14.6% of the population lives in extreme
poverty, which means the country is half way to reaching the first
Millenium Development Goal [MDG1 - to reduce by half the number of
people living in extreme poverty by 2015]. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">A study financed by
Holland and
Switzerland and carried out with technical assistence from the World
Bank, however, found in 2009 that only 9.7% of the population was
living in extreme poverty which would imply that Nicaragua had
already met MDG1. Similarly, in their 2010 report, the FAO [the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization] and the WFP [the World Food
Program], also find that Nicaragua, in terms of the reduction of
malnutrition, has already met MDG1. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Nicaragua has also
registered
improvements in all other indicators [used to measure progress in
terms of the MDGs], except for the HIV and AIDS rate which has
increased. This problem is an international problem that requires
greater efforts globally if the MDG is to be met in Nicaragua. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Examples of the reduction
in key
indicators include illiteracy which has dropped from 22% in 2006 to
3.3% in 2009 thanks to a campaign using the successful Cuban model
&#8220;Yo Sí Puedo&#8221; [&#8220;Yes, I can&#8221;]. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Maternal deaths and infant
deaths have
also been reduced while the malaria rate has dropped from 4.4 cases
per 100,000 inhabitants in the base year to 1.1 at present. During
the last three years there has not been a single death due to
malaria. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Nicaragua has been
benefitted by the
most brilliant innovation in development financing of the 21st
Century. This consists in Venezuelan solidarity channelled via the
PetroCaribe agreements which convert half of poor countries'
petroleum invoice into low interest, long term credit for poverty
reduction. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">ALBA[the Bolivarian
Alliance for the
People of Our America]'s support of social processes, the ALBA Bank
and the new regional currency, the SUCRE, represent other novel
elements of this new solidarity based alternative model. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">These are examples of the
sort of
innovative finance methods that are required to confront the
challenges of reducing poverty and inequality as well as the costs of
climate change. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It has been estimated that
an
additional US$50 billion in ODA [Official Development Assistance] is
required each year in order for the MDGs to be met between now and
2015. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Under current
circumstances, however,
it appears unlikely these funds will be made available: at present
only five countries comply with [the requirement to set aside] 0.7%
of GDP [for ODA]. Meanwhile, during the inauguration of this
conference we heard the Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, call on donor
countries not to cut external cooperation due to the crisis. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It might be more
effective, however, to
issue US$250 billion in Special Drawing Rights like the ones which
were so rapidly approved and distributed to the world's central banks
in 2008 and 2009 to maintain global financial liquidity. Special
Drawing Rights for the MDGs would establish that reducing extreme
poverty around the world by half is given at least as much priority
as rescuing banks. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Additionally, it is
necessary that the
struggle to achieve the MDGs is inclusive. In this sense, we applaud
the progress over the last two years in the efforts in favour of
peace and prosperity on both sides of the Taiwan strait and we hope
that the UN is able to find adequate forms for the participation of
Taiwan in this struggle, a struggle that belongs to all of us. </span>
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">With the government of
President
Commandant Daniel Ortega it has been possible to reduce poverty by
prioritizing the production of micro, small and medium businesses
including access to fair credit, seeds and fertilizers as well as
providing the tools for production directly to informal sector women
in urban areas and female small farmers in the countryside. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">On top of this, the human
and
constitutional right to free education and healthcare, which had been
denied as a result of the &#8220;cost recuperation&#8221; policies of the
previous neoliberal governments, has been reinstated. Also public
transport, water and electricity has been subsidized for the poor
majority in urban areas, and a Christian, socialist and solidarity
bonus has been distributed to low income State workers. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In summary, the
deregulation,
privatization, liberalization and minimization of the State has been
replaced with policies that facilitate the State's role of promoting
development and redistributing income and consumption in favour of
the poor. The result has been the reduction of the inequality
indicator, GINI, from 0.41 to 0.36 between 2005 and 2009 making
Nicaragua the least unequal country in Central America. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In order for these
achievements to be
sustained, of course, the economy must grow. And the good news is
that Nicaraguan exports this year are up 30% on last year. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">However, we and everyone
else are faced
by serious threats. Would would happen if there was a W-shaped
recession? Or a lost decade for many countries due to debt
repayments? Which is what happened in Latin America and the Caribbean
in the 80s when the regional economy shrunk by 1.9% over the whole
decade. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We all need the world
economy to
recover in order to achieve the MDGs. It should be clear by now that
this is not possible only via public spending, and within a short
amount of time it will become clear that this also applies to
savings. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In actual fact we face
multiple,
massive imbalances which indicate the need to transform the current
financial and economic arquitecture. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This is the case because
the process of
globalization has been so fast, the market so predominant, the State
so weak, regulation so impotent, speculation so profitable, the
virtual economy over the real economy so powerful, finance capital so
hegemonic, credit so limited, investments so short term, high
unemployment rates so resistant, the commercial imbalance so chronic,
the debt so enormous, currency emission so astronomical, the main
reserve currency so undisciplined and international political power
so concentrated. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">These factors are
interrelated and form
vicious circles which impede the transformation to the new model so
urgently needed to achieve economic recovery and the reduction of the
structural inequality which has contributed to this crisis. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">To finish, I would like to
point out
that, if these issues are not dealt with, the fulfillment of the MDGs
by 2015 - or at any point in the future - will be in danger. The same
can be said for the possibilities of reaching an inclusive and
binding global agreement about climate change within the framework of
the Kyoto Protocol and Convention. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The solution resides in
inclusion, it
resides in the democratization of international political and
economic relations as a means to achieving global peace and
stability, a world with human rights and social justice, a world
without poverty. In other words, the very objectives for which the
United Nations was created. </span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Thank you very much, Mr
President.</span> </td>
