<p class="text-align-justify"><em>"How do global powers orchestrate destabilisation and war? And how are propaganda constructs like the White Helmets brought to life? The only way to even begin to answer those questions is to follow the money, analyse the networks and interrogate the messaging. In ‘Purpose goes to Latin America’ Cory Morningstar, with Wrong Kind of Green’s Forrest Palmer, show how New Power exponents like Jeremy Heimans operate through elite networks, with seemingly endless incubations, to shape and capitalise upon ongoing destabilisation/humanitarian war/regime change. We are shown how Heimans and his networks are most concerned with the economics of behaviour change, attention metrics and shaping public narratives framed as giving “consumers” “opportunities to shape their own future”. We are shown how New Power exponents are socially engineering consent for the endless consumer economy, but sell themselves as pioneers of ‘change’ and builders of social movements for ‘the people’ when clearly it is neoliberal forces that call the tune. Morningstar and Palmer’s explication of the networks, funders, and talking points being deployed shows that the very same New Power exponents who delivered for the global elites in Syria are preparing to deliver more of the same in Latin America.”—</em> <em><strong>Australian activist, Wrong Kind of Green Collective, Michael Swifte</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Purpose website: “Purpose moves people to remake the world.”</em></p>

<h3><strong>Preface: </strong></h3>

<p>Both Avaaz and for-profit sister organization, Purpose, have been key players in building mainstream acquiescence both domestically and internationally for the destabilization of sovereign states.</p>

<p>This pattern goes back to at least 2004 when Avaaz co-founders campaigned for foreign intervention via a no-fly zone on Darfur under the auspices of Res Publica, an NGO founded by Tom Perriello (co-founder of DarfurGenocide.org, later U.S. Congressman), Ricken Patel (consultant for the United Nations, co-founder of DarfurGenocide.org) and Tom Pravda (U.K. diplomat, U.S. State Department). In 2007, these same individuals founded Avaaz in addition to Ali Pariser (MoveOn), Andrea Woodhouse (World Bank) and spouse David Madden (World Bank). Co-founders of Purpose include David Madden as well as James Sleezak. Purpose Europe was co-founded with Tim Dixon, who has co-founded seven organizations since 2010 including The Syria Campaign, The Rules, Movilizatorio (MOV) and the Jo Cox Foundation.</p>

<p>[To view the full bios and interlocking mind map, see Appendix I, attached to this report.]</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned individuals, Avaaz was also co-founded by parent organizations MoveOn and Res Publica with financing from George Soros’ Open Society Institute (OSI). Assistance was also provided by <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/people/aryeh-neier">OSI’s Arych Neier</a>. Aryeh Neier is President Emeritus of the Open Society Foundations and served as President from 1993 to 2012. He is the co-founder of Human Rights Watch (1988) which was founded in 1978 as the U.S. <a href="http://humanityjournal.org/issue-5-3/from-helsinki-to-human-rights-watch-how-an-american-cold-war-monitoring-group-became-an-international-human-rights-institution/">Helsinki Watch</a> Committee, financed by the Ford Foundation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Other key elements of the international mobilization include Avaaz, which is already an OSI grantee and close collaborator.” — <em>Memorandum, Cc: George Soros, Aryeh Neier, Jonathan Soros from Nancy Youman, “Recommended next steps for OSI on climate”, July 10, 2009; revised August 10, 2009</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“When we created Human Rights Watch, one of the main purposes at the outset was to leverage the power, the purse and the influence of the United States to try to promote human rights in other countries.” — <em>Aryeh Neier [<a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2010/10/08/the-soros-syndrome/">Source</a>]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On January 16, 2007, the article Avaaz.org: MoveOn Goes International [<a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Avaaz-MoveOn-Goes-International.pdf">Avaaz MoveOn Goes International</a>] discloses the following: 1) MoveOn and Res Publica are the founding/parent NGOs of Avaaz, 2) the MoveOn model developed a new small-donor base for Democratic candidates, and helped win a number of key elections, 3) OSI was confirmed to have given financial backing to Avaaz for its start-up and, 4) there were no corrections or retractions by the author. Supporting evidence to the above is provided regarding the Avaaz launch by people integral to its conception. In the article, comments were made by Paul Hilder (recognized as an Avaaz co-founder at this early stage) and Lee-Sean Huang. Huang was a campaigner for Res Publica and Avaaz from 2006-2007. He then went on to Human Rights Watch (2007-2008), United Nations (consultant, 2013-2015) and Purpose (2009-2016) to his current role as “Head of Community” at New Power. Neither Hilder nor Huang disputed any of the authors findings.</p>

<p>In 2012 Wrong Kind of Green began to document the extensive research into the relationships and alliances behind Avaaz. This has resulted in two separate series. The first written in 2012 and the second ongoing series commencing in 2017. (Side note: Although perhaps distressing, we implore citizens and activists alike, especially those in the Global South, to read both series.)</p>

<p><em>[<a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2012/09/10/avaaz-imperialist-pimps-of-militarism-protectors-of-the-oligarchy-trusted-facilitators-of-war/">September 10, 2012</a>: Avaaz: Imperialist Pimps of Militarism, Protectors of the Oligarchy, Trusted Facilitators of War] </em></p>

<p><em>[<a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2017/07/27/avaaz-the-globes-largest-most-powerful-behavioural-change-network-part-i/">July 27, 2017</a>: AVAAZ: The Globe’s Largest &amp; Most Powerful Behavioural Change Network]</em></p>

<p>The research demonstrates the nefarious and hegemonic role of NGOs within the world’s existing power structure. The non-profit industrial complex serves hegemony as a sophisticated fine-tuned symbiotic mechanism in a continuous state of flux and refinement. The ruling elite channel an immeasurable amount of resources and tools through these organizations to further strengthen, protect and expand existing forms of power structures and global domination, inclusive of white supremacy. This forms a symbiotic relationship between the non-profit industrial complex and the hand that feeds. The outcome is soft power in its most efficient form.</p>

<p>Foreign policy, neocolonialism, imperialism, and intervention are all instruments that must be utilized with sharp precision to achieve these goals. It is for this reason that NGOs such as Avaaz and Purpose are given the tools, support and funding required to continuously expand and multiply. As such, they are key force multipliers in servitude to the quest of western dominance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The UNHRC, and its supportive NGOs such as the US-staffed and Soros-funded Human Rights Watch, impose a singular, Eurocentric definition of democracy whose implementation has not only blocked popular and direct forms of democracy, but also directly contributed to the generation of inter-ethnic strife in many post-colonies of the periphery.” — <a href="https://www.alertpress.org/vol-5-ebook.html">FORCE MULTIPLIERS THE INSTRUMENTALITIES OF IMPERIALISM</a><em>, Maximilian C. Forte, 2015</em></p>

<p>If power dominated through hierarchy and coercion – the emergent “new power” model dominates with influence and persuasion. And while this has been achieved for some decades now by the NGOs that comprise the non-profit industrial, more and more corporations, institutions and states, are now applying it to their business models. The key differences are that 1) the organizers remain invisible and 2), the populace is manipulated into believing that they control said movements.</p>

<p>At the helm of this new model is Avaaz/Purpose co-founder Jeremy Heimans. Purpose, the PR firm (with many arms) specializes in movement building and behavioural change.</p>

<p>Heiman’s vision is to organize “people not as citizens but as consumers” to further empower corporations and brands that he refers to as “the angels”. Partners include some of the world’s most powerful corporations, foundations and institutions including The Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, Unilever, Ikea, General Electric, Starbucks, TED, Oxfam, SEIU, WHO, Unicef, ACLU, British Telecom, the Concordia Summit and Nike. Collaborators include We Mean Business and The B Team which is registered to the address of Purpose New York. With strong ties and loyalties to many elite institutions and oligarchs such as Purpose partner the United Nations (where Heimans cut his teeth as in intern in 1999), the Omidyar Network a[1] and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/about-us/the-secretary-generals-global-council/">Virgin’s Richard Branson</a> (founder of The B Team, The Elders, Carbon War Room, etc.), Purpose is now global with seven international offices operating in New York, San Francisco, London, New Delhi, Nairobi, Sao Paulo, and <a href="http://www.bandt.com.au/marketing/getup-co-founder-open-sydney-office-social-change-agency-purpose">Sydney</a>. This expansion is in line with new behavioural insight teams that are steadily proliferating in government buildings across the globe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/opinion/the-new-power-structure.html">The New Power Structure</a>, April 5, 2018, The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“These organizations are often founded by what you might call disappearing organizers. Somebody comes up with a compelling concept, like TED or Black Lives Matter. The concept gives people a sticky group identity; many people think of themselves as Tedsters. The core idea is spreadable, actionable and connected — it allows participants to subcreate in local and flexible ways. Tedsters organize and attend over 20,000 local TEDx events. The founder doesn’t dominate the network so much as manage the community.”<em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">“The co-founder of GetUp! might be the most influential Australian in the world.” — The Monthly, April, 2018</h2>

<p>March 31, 2018, <a href="http://www.theartofannihilation.com/angels-demons-otherwise-known-as-the-conquerors-the-conquered/">Angels and Demons – Otherwise Known as the Conquerors and the Conquered</a>:</p>

<p>The concept of “new power” has been named by CNN as one of ten ideas that can change the world. “Originally laid out as the Big Idea in Harvard Business Review and subsequent TED talk, new power offers a frame to understand the distributed and participatory models that are rising in business, life and society.” [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OuiShareTV/about">OuiShareTV</a>]</p>

<p>According to Heimans, “power traditionally functions as a currency, something valuable to which society wants to cling. The new power, on the other hand, works like a current: it is fluid. While the old forms of power are based on pyramidal forms and a power that goes from “top down”, the new power works in reverse, “as an “upload”. The new models of power are founded and inhabited by the coordination and agency of the masses, without participation these forms of power remain empty. These new models are collaborative platforms that need the active collaboration of their participants to survive.” [<a href="http://clubdefundraising.com/surfear-las-nuevas-olas-del-poder-jeremy-heimans-en-el-ifc-2017/">Source</a>]</p>

<p>What the “new power” model actually represents is capitalism in its most efficient form. Citizens, en masse, are utilized, organized and mobilized to provide social media online content – which is then captured and exploited for increased corporate revenues – with no monetary compensation for their labour. Although such movements may appear to be “founded and inhabited by the coordination and agency of the masses” (Heimans) – they have been largely created, or co-opted, at or since inception. The “new power” “uploads” to an existing structure. The structure responds by “downloading” an illusion of capitulation in order to satisfy/empower the masses. Yet, by design, its true triumph is the achievement of the following: 1) creating/accelerating economic growth (i.e. market mechanisms), 2) consolidating added power into the hands of the West, 3) the further insulating of the elite classes from all/any risk, 4) protecting and expanding the capitalist economic system, and 5) resolving issues only within the confines of the globe’s current power structures.</p>

<p>Never in history have such powerful conglomerates managed to foment and then seize the required labour to create billion dollar platforms and profits – for free, as they do today. Such fervor for the citizenry to bestow their labour to the elites classes is textbook “Brave New World.” Karl Marx’s theory of surplus labour is classically interpreted as the “extra labour produced by a worker for his employer, to be put towards capital accumulation.” It could be said (even in jest) that one good example of surplus labor in modern times is “the extra labour (physical) produced by the “prosumer”, the willing participants for the elite classes (via social media), to be put towards cultural appropriation and modification (in the form of social capital) with no ownership over the means of production (digital platforms).</p>

<p>Consider that while Western society criticizes the Bolivian government for legalizing child labour laws in order to protect working Bolivian children, it remains completely ignorant of the fact that the elite global corporatocracy is exploiting labour from their own Western children for free – via social media – in what we can call postmodern Western domination. A Brave New World model of “soft exploitation” – with no protection from adults whatsoever. [2] Hence while child labour is a respected part of Bolivia’s social conscience – the gross exploitation and manipulation of their own children and youth (that enriches corporations as opposed to enriching families) does not even register in our collective consciousness at all.</p>

<p>This direct line to youth via the cell phone surpasses all levels of social engineering on a scale never before imagined much less thought to be achievable. The art of storytelling, exploitation and manipulation, at once consolidated to create a youth populace in the image of superficiality and consumption. The Children of the West have been thrown to the wolves. A gift to our corporate gods.</p>

<p>As one of ten ideas that can change the world, embraced and highlighted by some of the world’s most powerful and elite institutions, the false perception of grass roots mobilization seizing power (designed and financed by the oligarchs) is a strategic marketing maneuver designed to create a short-term euphoria that feels like victory. The perceived victory –achieved via “the deployment of mass participation and peer coordination” (Heimans) – is always made malleable to further protect – the identical powers. Hence, it is not “new power”, it is “old power” simply rebranded with more vapid methods of exploitation targeting and manipulating the target demographic, which is “millennials”.</p>

<p>According to Heimans what societies are experiencing and undergoing today is “a big war over values”. What is unspoken is whose values Heiman’s New York PR firm pledges allegiance to and is paid to expand: Western values.”</p>

<p>The world is on fire. Latin America is no exception. From Haiti, to Venezuela, to Honduras, to Brazil, to Paraguay, to Argentina, Ecuador, to Nicaragua, to Cuba, socialist or left leaning governments of sovereign states that resist foreign interference and persevere in their lawful right to self-determination have been relentlessly targeted for destabilization and coups by empire. Some have thus far courageously withstood imperial powers (Venezuela, Nicaragua) and some have tragically not. Many continue to fight. Disguised within these efforts is the 21<sup>st</sup> century Trojan horse – the NGO.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one can articulate the transition of tactics and accelerating crises better than Gustavo Borges Revilla, director of the Venezuelan media project Misión Verdad:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In 2015 we said that this new model of intervention would be used in Nicaragua and we state here in Havana in 2018, that Cuba is a country that could be a candidate to suffer this model of intervention. Which is nothing less than a reconfiguration of countries’ cultural identities, and the hijacking of values and principles characteristic of the Left for many years. I’m talking about human rights, solidarity, youth, categories that are being reconfigured by bodies like, just to give one example, the Open Society Foundation.” — <em>La izquierda está consumida por la propaganda occidental [The Left is Consumed by Propaganda], Gustavo Borges Revilla, director of the Venezuelan media project Misión Verdad during the 24th Sao Paulo Forum in Havana, Cuba held July, 2018 [<a href="http://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2018/07/25/the-left-is-consumed-by-western-propaganda/">Source</a>]</em></p>

<p>In March 2017, the city of Bogotá, Colombia, was home to the first Global Summit on Social Innovation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The event, hosted by The Rockefeller Foundation, the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank Group and its local partner, Compartamos con Colombia, convened more than 65 Social Innovation Organizations from 5 continents. Taking advantage of this unique opportunity, the hosts of the event commissioned Movilizatorio—a civic engagement and social innovation lab for Latin America incubated by Purpose—to carry out research aimed at understanding the challenges that SIOs [social innovation organizations] face today and, based on evidence, propose new ways to address them. To develop this research, they also identified a sample of 42 SIOs that were the focus and source of information during the project.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/bitstream/handle/11319/8900/Boosting-Collaborative-Impact-The-Momentum-for-Social-Innovation.pdf">2017 report</a> <em>Boosting Collaborative Impact-The Momentum for Social Innovation</em> (Inter-American Development Bank):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Purpose moves people to remake the world</strong>. Driven by people, <strong>enabled by technology: Purpose builds movements and new power models</strong> to tackle the world’s biggest problems. A certified B Corp, <strong>we create and launch our own ventures, collaborate with the world’s leading organizations, and develop technology, tools, and content that move millions to remake the world. </strong>From climate change and global LGBT rights, to the food system and gun violence in America, <strong>we’ve launched some of the biggest and most successful experiments in movement building and mass participation in recent years</strong>.” <em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the helm of this new summit is the Rockefeller Foundation, the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en/resources-for-businesses/multilateral-investment-fund%2C5763.html">Multilateral Investment Fund</a> (MIF, or FOMIN as the fund is known in Spanish), and Compartamos con Colombia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“THE TEAM: This project was possible thanks to the sponsorship, advice, and constant accompaniment of the teams from FOMIN, The Rockefeller Foundation, and Compartamos con Colombia… <strong>The final report was consolidated by a team from Movilizatorio and Purpose, composed of Jessy Tolkan</strong>, Juliana Uribe, Lina Torres, and Nadya Hernández.”<em>[Emphasis added]</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in <a href="http://www.purpose.com/about/purpose-labs/purpose-climate-lab/">Brazil</a>, Purpose has been working with the Greenpeace Mobilization Lab (<a href="https://mobilisationlab.org/about/our-roots/">Mob Lab</a>) on campaigns that include the <a href="https://readymag.com/u91696908/790640/">City of Dreams</a> voting campaign, the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-thabiso-edkins/rio-the-olympics-for-clim_b_11849936.html">1.5C Campaign</a> (#1.5C Olympics) with the World Bank, <a href="https://mobilisationlab.org/city-of-dreams-brazil/">The Bus of Dreams</a> campaign, campaign Resista and “Content in the Periferias”. The Mob Lab offers services that include “<a href="https://mobilisationlab.org/rapid-response-system-leverages-repression/">creating a rapid response system that leverages repression for your cause</a>“. Greenpeace is the founder of GCCA, better known as TckTckTck, the umbrella organization that grossly undermined the most vulnerable states (such as Bolivia) being impacted by climate change at the United Nations Conference of the Parties (Copenhagen, 2009). GCCA/Greenpeace also organized the 2014 People’s Climate March with Purpose.

<h3><strong>Blatant Paternalism</strong></h3>

<p>In February 2018 Movilizatorio in partnership with <a href="http://www.acdivoca.org/about/team/">ACDI / VOCA</a> and <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/es/colombia">USAID Colombia</a> , launched a test “<a href="http://www.bajemoslealtonito.com/">Let’s go down to the tonito</a>” (translated as “let’s lower our tone”, a seeming implication that it is the fault of the defenseless for not extending an olive branch to its oppressor). Utilizing the latest advances in “behavioral economics”, the <a href="http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/about-us/">Behavioral Insights Team</a><u> UK </u>designed a test for Colombians to measure their levels of aggression. Following the test recommendations are offered that are supposedly focused on improving their reactions to stressful situations, thus “betting on a more tolerant Colombia”. [<a href="https://www.movilizatorio.org/noticias/2018/2/19/le-bajamos-al-tonito-juntos">Source</a>] As an aside, one can only wonder about the public comfort level if a test of this nature was administered by a foreign NGO at the behest of a state agency such as China’s New International Development Cooperation Agency in partnership with The Russian Federation’s Official Development Assistance, to American citizens.</p>

<p>Further blatant Western paternalism is found in the <a href="http://howtobuildup.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20180507_Final-Report-BP17_English.pdf">2017 BuildPeace report</a> on the conference organized by Movilizatorio and partner NGOs including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Heinrich Böll Foundation. [3]</p>

<p>Page 7 of 61 the report bears the subtitle “Not a White Man’s Burden”. It goes on to explain: “Every year at Build Peace, we bring up a concern about the articulation of innovation for peace as a new ‘white man’s burden’—in which it is the Global North that is the sole repository of knowledge, innovation and technologies for conflict transformation. That’s obviously not true, partly because capacities for peace exist in all contexts, but also because the problem of peace is one that is also relevant to the Global North.”</p>

<p>How gallant it is of the ruling elite to inform the global south that they ought not to be reliant on the peace directives of the Global North. The same Global North which has been responsible for world wars that have disaffected people who have no vested interest in the outcome and have been innocent victims by all participants.</p>

<p>+++</p>

<p>The report also highlighted the Build Peace Lab partnership between Build Up &amp; Movilizatorio which has created the <a href="https://howtobuildup.org/#team">Build Peace Fellows</a> program and <a href="https://www.syriadigitalsteps.org/en/home-2/">Digital Steps – Supporting Syrian Innovators</a> (both fellowship programs). The Digital Steps Fellowship is a collaboration between <a href="https://howtobuildup.org/">Build Up</a> and the <a href="https://syria.britishcouncil.org/en">British Council Syria</a> (Britain) and <a href="https://natakallam.com/">NaTakallam</a> (We Speak), an <a href="https://natakallam.com/about/">initiative</a> funded by the World Bank (via <a href="http://www.we-mena.org/">WeMENA</a>) .</p>

<p>The Igarapé Institute (which will be discussed further in this report) also played a participatory if not leading role in the conference. [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19CQqEsMn1JfvEWuwIqk0BEokJN8Q7s7Q1HAfhZQYcgw/edit">Source</a>]</p>

<p><em>Movilizatorio website</em></p>

<p>Movilizatorio, a “citizen engagement lab” (an alternative name applied to an NGO that utilizes studies in behavioural sciences) for Colombia and Latin America, is incubated by Purpose. By the end of 2016, Movilizatorio had gained a major presence in most of Columbia, built partnerships with major national and international organisations and NGOs and launched a digital platform for citizen participation that reached over 30k users within the first two weeks of launching. [<a href="https://the-dots.com/users/manuela-murrle-241827">Source</a>]</p>

<p>Juliana Uribe Villegas is the Founder and Executive Director of Movilizatorio, the “citizen participation and social innovation laboratory of Purpose for Colombia and Latin America”. Prior to her role in Movilizatorio, Villegas was a Senior Strategist for Purpose, advising global entities such as Hewlett Foundation and Here Now (Purpose). Villegas is a graduate of Harvard University as a Master of Public Administration and Mason Fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of Government and of the University of Barcelona as Master Cum Laude in International Relations.

<p>The project manager for Movilizatorio is <a href="https://www.movilizatorio.org/nadya-hernandez">Nadya Hernández Beltrán</a>. During 2017, Beltrán was an International Center for Journalists Fellow at PeaceTech Lab in United States (November 14-16, 2017, US Professional Fellows Congress publication). [<a href="https://amaniinstitute.org/profile/nadya-beltran/">Bio</a>]</p>

<p>Movilizatorio campaign leader Mario Alvarado is co-founder of Change.org in Colombia. [<a href="https://www.movilizatorio.org/mario-alvarado">Bio</a>]</p>

<p>Mariana Diaz Kraus is the Director of Partnerships and Strategy. Diaz is a lawyer and magister in political science. She holds a Master of Law and Diplomacy from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (USA).

<p>Here we can pause to reflect on the ties of those stationed within the foreign NGOs that are proliferated throughout the Global South – to the prestigious universities, organizations and institutions that have been founded in the Western world. An interwoven network of relationships built upon centuries of colonialism and imperialism that continues to this day. In essence, a non-profit industrial complex equivalent of the *School of the Americas, where people from Latin America were/are schooled in the techniques of torture and humiliation in order to implement despotic rule for the purpose of enhancing the domination of the people for Western interests. The difference being that in this politically correct realm, the techniques of torture are replaced with the methods of soft-power. [*Now operating as Western Hemisphere Institute for Security cooperation (WHINSEC)]</p>

<p>In furtherance of its agenda, Movilizatorio has many projects and allies in place to meet its objectives (assuredly influenced and/or managed by Purpose and other Western organizations).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.elavisperomov.org/">Avispero</a> is the primary mobilization campaign for Movilizatorio. It is described as a community of agents of change (wasps) that transform behaviour. As a sign of its establishment leanings, El Avispero received the Turner Award for Social Transformation in 2017, a satellite of the Nobel Peace Prizes name brand.

<p>To demonstrate the interlocking directorate of the non-profit industrial complex, here it should be noted that Dixon’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB0_FzW3ra0">More in Common co-founders</a> include Gemma Mortensen and Mathieu Lefevre (CEO).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“More in Common is a non-profit organisation incubated by Purpose Europe. Purpose builds and supports movements to advance the fight for an open, just, and habitable world. The co-founders of More in Common are Brendan Cox, Tim Dixon, Mathieu Lefevre, and Gemma Mortensen.” — <em>Executive Summart: Attitudes Towards Refugees, Immigrants, and Identity in France, </em><a href="https://www.thesocialchangeinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/More-in-Common-France-Executive-Summary.pdf">July 2017</a><em>, More in Common, Purpose Europe, the Social Change Initiative</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mortensen served as Change.org’s Chief Global Officer overseeing teams in 17 countries. Prior to this she held the position of Executive Director of Crisis Action, having led international campaigns on Iran, Burma, Gaza, and Sudan. Mortensen’s bio is extensive, having worked for the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom to the United Nations in New York and the European Commission in Geneva and Sudan. [<a href="https://worldfellows.yale.edu/gemma-mortensen">Bio</a>] [<a href="https://philanthropyforum.org/people/gemma-mortensen/">Source</a>]</p>

<p>Based in Paris, Lefevre, with a background in economics, is a Senior Advisor to Purpose. As with many of his peers, Lefevre attended the Harvard Kennedy School and worked for the United Nations. From 2005 to 2010, Lefevre worked for the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations, serving in Lebanon and Afghanistan.

<p>Brendan Cox is a former Special Adviser to Prime Minister Gordon Brown whose wife Jo Cox (MP for Batley and Spen) was murdered on June 16, 2016. Former US President Barack Obama invited Brendan Cox and his two young children to the White House on September 23, 2016. Brendan Cox is yet another Purpose affiliate caught up in recent sexual misconduct allegations. "On February 17, 2018, Brendan Cox announced his immediate resignation from the Jo Cox Foundation and More In Common – the charities he launched to honour the memory of his wife – and apologised for the "hurt and offence" he has caused to women, saying he was "deeply apologetic" for his inappropriate behaviour." [<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5404241/Jo-Coxs-husband-admits-sex-pest-resigns.html ">Source</a>] The <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/jo-cox-assassination-white-helmets-humanitarianism-regime-change/246646/">tangled web</a> and exploitation of Joe Cox to benefit the Purpose construct, the White Helmets, continues to gain speed, in real life time. [The White Helmets, a <a href="http://www.theartofannihilation.com/the-humanitarian-industrial-complex-school-of-thought-a-fish-analogy/">21st century NGO hybrid</a> and "propaganda construct" (John Pilger), has been extensively researched and documented by independent journalists <a href="https://thewallwillfall.org/">Vanessa Beeley</a> , <a href="https://ingaza.wordpress.com/">Eva Bartlett</a>   and a small handful of others.]</p>

<p>As an example of backgrounds that comprise NGOs marketed as “activist” in ideology, consider the <a href="https://www.moreincommon.com/our-team/">qualifications</a> of Rukmini Giridharadas, <em>Senior Strategist, More in Common US: </em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Rukmini Giridharadas previously worked at Google, Change.org, and in US military intelligence studying how social media plays a role in war and conflict. She was educated at Brown University and Harvard Business School.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, Giridharadas worked for the United States Department of Defense. From 2009 – 2012 Giridharadas: 1) worked on a team developing intelligence assessments on how social technologies used in conflict situations around the world. Reports used to inform US policymakers and military leaders, 2) won funding to create a tool that would help team forecast geopolitical events using real-time data, 3) was selected to join team producing morning brief for President Obama and advisors, 4) with a small team of 40 analysts from government and private sector, went on month-long assignment to forecast future of social media and geopolitical trends. From group chosen as briefer to report findings to White House and Directorate of National Intelligence.

<p>Having attended Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, Heimans interned for the United Nations where his career began in 1999. [<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3018195/11-jeremy-heimans">Source</a>] Heimans then cut his teeth with the management consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Company. In 2007 he co-founded Avaaz. Purpose would follow two years later although the year of Purpose’s beginnings has been challenged in Australian Parliament. [4] In 2009 Heimans hired the first Purpose team member <a href="https://www.netrootsnation.org/profile/andre-banks/">Andre Banks</a>. The list of achievements (i.e. clients) of Purpose includes the Women’s Marches following Trump’s inauguration in 2017 and a strong relationship with Black Lives Matters. [<a href="https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/april/1522501200/malcolm-knox/jeremy-heimans-start">Source</a>] Purpose clients and partnerships include many of the most powerful institutions, corporations and manufactured/managed movements on the planet such as the United Nations/UNHCR, Google, UNICEF, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Ikea, Unilever, Black Lives Matter, etc.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Heimans says that Purpose embraces “pragmatic idealism” and doesn’t adopt purist positions. “We like to say we can speak the language of an Occupy activist, a Facebook product manager and a UN technocrat.” It also speaks the language of Unilever and Nike, two of its corporate partners, as well as that of #MeToo. If a partner “veers off course” and does things that nobody at Purpose can support, “then we have to fire them”. This is underpinned by Purpose’s status under American law as a public-benefit corporation, a new legal structure that mandates companies to serve the wider society rather than simply its shareholders, giving an economic value to philanthropy.” [<a href="https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/april/1522501200/malcolm-knox/jeremy-heimans-start">Source</a>]</p>

<p>Here it is vital to observe Heimans and Timms co-optation of #MeToo language/values supposedly adopted by Purpose. In December 2017, 92nd Street Y the organization run by <a href="https://www.gcn.org/articles/Power-shift-The-GivingTuesday-founder-on-the-%E2%80%9Cnew-power%E2%80%9D-principles-transforming">Heiman’s New Power co-author, Executive Director Henry Timms<strong> </strong></a>, chose Ari Shavit to deliver the keynote address to mark Israel’s 70th anniversary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When I learned this week that the 92nd Street Y is advertising admitted sexual predator Ari Shavit as their keynote speaker to mark Israel’s 70th anniversary, it became unambiguously clear that the insulated, powerful, and tone-deaf Jewish boys’ club is still running the show, to the detriment of women and all victims of sexual assault. On the most basic level, this decision ignores women as consumers. The idea that women and sexual assault victims would be horrified by this choice apparently did not occur to the organizers. That we would never come to an event like this doesn’t seem to matter. Whoever the victims of sexual abuse are – women and men alike – we are irrelevant. We are not even considered as potential attendees. It is a stunning dismissal of victims from the community.” — <em>Seriously, 92Y – Ari Shavit Should Never Have Been Invited In The First Place, </em><a href="https://forward.com/opinion/390179/seriously-92y-ari-shavit-should-never-have-been-invited-in-the-first-place/"><em>December 15, 2017</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the trillion dollar philanthropy industry, this type of open hypocrisy is called “wewashing” – something those in the non-profit are typically extremely fearful to be accused of.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://cep.org/philanthropys-new-power-challenges/">May 3, 2018</a> article published by The Center for Effective Philanthropy, <em>Philanthropy’s “New Power” Challenge: </em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There is also the danger of what the authors call “WeWashing,” citing a term coined by a friend of theirs that refers to the danger of “using the language of the crowd without having any meaningful interest in engaging with it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this isn’t the only instance of “wewashing” demonstrated by NewPower authors Timms and Heimans. Consider the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti">sexual exploitation scandal by Oxfam</a>, which made international headlines. [<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxfam-latest-sex-scandal-prostitution-rape-children-haiti-warned-2008-save-the-children-a8214781.html">February 16, 2018</a>, The Independent: “Oxfam was told of aid workers raping and sexually exploiting children in Haiti a decade ago.”] Oxfam is a key partner of Purpose. To this day, the Oxfam partnership and logo continues to be proudly displayed on the Purpose website. Further allegations have since emerged involving Save the Children and the United Nations [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/05/oxfam-scandal-fallout-out-of-proportion-clare-short">source</a>] , with United Nations being not only the key partner to Purpose &amp; Timms co-founded “movements”, but the building block of the non-profit industrial complex as a whole.</p>

<p>So much for Heiman’s statement “[I]f a partner “veers off course” and does things that nobody at Purpose can support, “then we have to fire them”. The appropriation of the said movement #metoo – by individuals that condone sexual predators and sexual misconduct in their own tight knit circles – is as vulgar and cold as it is arrogant. This superficiality on display is so egregious, it is blinding.</p>

<p>Video. April 13, 2018, “‘New Power’ authors Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms discuss “authenticity” and how people can obtain power in the 21st century”:</p>

<p>+++</p>

<p>Perhaps nowhere is Jeremy Heimans crème de la crème status more visible as in the recent high level event at the United Nations: The <a href="https://www.un.org/ecosoc/en/node/996604">6th Biennial High-level Meeting of the Development Cooperation Forum</a> (DCF) (United Nations Headquarters, New York, 21-22 May 2018):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In a keynote address, Jeremy Heimans, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Purpose, noted that development cooperation was traditionally organized in an “old power” fashion, in which top-down dynamics were most prevalent. In that structure, beneficiaries were not directly involved in the decision-making that would most affect their lives due to an unequal power dynamic and lack of agency.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yet, a “new power” structure was emerging, he said, in which power was distributed more equally among stakeholders. In that context, he underlined that more efforts must be undertaken to build institutions that fuelled citizens’ hunger to “take part”, pointing to online platforms as being highly effective at engaging people. He noted that there was a lot that could be learned from such social movements, many of which were maximizing collective action dynamics. In that connection, development cooperation should be shifted in a way that actively engaged people and gave them opportunities to shape their own future, he said.” [<a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/ecosoc6915.doc.htm">Source</a>]</p>

<p>Aside from Purpose entering Latin American as a Trojan Horse, the goals of Purpose, in Columbia to start, for privatization are clear. Consider 2016 summit speaker <a href="https://www.concordia.net/community/seth-miller-gabriel/">Seth W. Miller Gabriel</a> is the first Director of the Office of Public-Private Partnerships for the District of Columbia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The issues of transparency and accountability were a main theme in Concordia’s programming throughout 2016. <strong>At both the Concordia Americas Summit in Miami and the Annual Summit in New York, we held discussions on corruption and governance, with a particular focus on Latin America.</strong> Additionally, at the Annual Summit, <strong>Concordia partnered with the National Democratic Institute to host a session highlighting the political and economic stability in the Middle East as an example for other democratic transitions in the region</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is vital to note the job description for the <a href="https://co.linkedin.com/in/marioandresalvarado">Purpose Campaigner in Columbia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Responsible for finding moments of global political crisis</strong> and building a campaign strategy where people all over the world can take action to demonstrate <strong>the power of public opinion </strong>over the international decision making process.” <em>[Emphasis added] </em></p>

<p>“Progress in the next 15 years and beyond—including effectively setting and achieving the next set of global development goals—can’t just be left to the same old power players. Now you can actively involve people in shaping these goals, using new participatory, transparent, and bottom-up new power models.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tune into this high-level discussion with speakers including Sir Richard Branson, Kathy Calvin, Gary White and Matt Damon, Chris Elias, Jeremy Heimans, Hannah Jones, JR Kerr, Kumi Naidoo and Hans Vestberg to explore how these emerging models can help us shape our world in coming decades and envision a bolder #2030Now.</p>

<p>[1] A recent development for Avaaz/Purpose co-founder David Madden (World Bank, etc.) and founder of the PR firm Phandeeyar in Burma, is his new affiliation with the social ventures investment company and Purpose partner Omidyar Network: “I’m going to be spending the next six months as an <em>Entrepreneur-in-Residence</em> at <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a>. Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment fund established by ebay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pam, is one of Phandeeyar’s key supporters. Phandeeyar isn’t the first tech hub that Omidyar has backed and it probably won’t be the last.” [<a href="https://medium.com/@davidmadden/building-innovation-ecosystems-in-frontier-markets-9b4b041ecf98">Source</a>]</p>

<p>[2] May 26, 2016: “Teens are spending nearly <em>nine hours a day</em> consuming media. And children ages eight to 12 are spending nearly six hours a day doing the same thing. Let’s say the average teen wakes up at 7 a.m. and goes to bed at 10 p.m. — that means that nine of their 15 waking hours are spent on their phones, computers, or tablets.” [Source: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/teens-average-phone-screen-usage-2016-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/teens-average-phone-screen-usage-2016-5</a>] | January 4, 2017: ” Teens now spend up to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/health/teens-tweens-media-screen-use-report/">nine hours a day</a> on social platforms, while <a href="http://www.globalwebindex.net/blog/social-media-captures-30-of-online-time">30% of all time spent online</a> is now allocated to social media interaction. And the majority of that time is on mobile – 60% of social media time spent is <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/how-are-consumers-spending-their-time-online-66742/">facilitated by a mobile device</a>.” [<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/how-much-time-do-people-spend-social-media-infographic">https://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/how-much-time-do-people-spen…</a>]</p>

<p>[3] “Build Peace 2017 was possible thanks to the generous support of the people of the United States through their Agency for International Development (USAID), as well as Andes University, the PeaceNexus Foundation, the Heinrich Böll Stiftung, New Markets Advisors, the Greater Bogotá Convention Bureau, the Agency of the GIZ in Colombia, and the United Nations in Colombia. The event was co-organized by Build Up and Policéntrico, with the support of Bogotá’s Town Hall through the Center for Memory, Peace and Reconciliation, the SOLE Colombia Foundation, the Ideas para la Paz Foundation, Peace Startup, TIC4GOOD, Movilizatorio, La Metro, INNpulsa Colombia, and Appiario.”</p>

<p>[4] “On the 13 April 2005, Purpose Campaigns, cofounded by Heimans and Madden, posted an ad describing itself as a new, progressive, political campaigning organisation. Noting the Win Back Respect campaign, the ad said: ‘Purpose Campaigns was established in 2005 to continue campaigning on important progressive issues, especially in the area of foreign policy, national security and global justice issues. Purpose Campaigns is currently involved in a variety of entrepreneurial political activities, including establishing a rapid response campaigning organisation designed to explode the myth of Republican primacy of national security.'” Source: <a href="https://www.openaustralia.org.au/senate/?gid=2016-09-13.16.3">https://www.openaustralia.org.au/senate/?gid=2016-09-13.16.3</a></p>

<p>[5] “The Summit was historically significant as it marked the first-ever meeting between Luis Almagro Lemes, Secretary General, Organization of American States, and Venezuelan human rights activist, Lilian Tintori, who spoke about the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. As a result of the Summit, Mr. Almagro affirmed the Carta Democratica which outlines provisions and strategies for change in the country’s electoral process and, in turn, its fundamental rights.” [<a href="https://uploads.concordia.net/2017/05/22170329/ANNUALREPORT2016.pdf">Source</a>]</p>
