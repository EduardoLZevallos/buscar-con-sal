      <br>
Since I left my post as President of the UN General Assembly on
September 14th 2009, I have been working on a Proposal to Reinvent the
United Nations Organization. That Proposal will be presented shortly.<br>
      <br>
I find myself among those who are convinced that today, more than ever,
the world needs a true United Nations that helps us join together all
the peoples and governments of the world to defend the right to life
and all the other inalienable rights of individual human beings and of
humanity as a whole, of all living things, of nature in general and of
Mother Earth. The United Nations as we have it now is a farce, an
enormous lie, because some people have dedicated themselves to vitiate
it beyond any possibility of reform.<br>
      <br>
I say this because it is evident that, within the Organization, we have
a Member State, the most influential on account of its wealth and
military power, which has managed to persuade other Members, mainly
those of the so-called first world, to work for an agenda radically
different from the agenda of Peace, respect and harmony between all
Member States, respecting always their sovereign equality, something
the Charter enshrines as its first principle. That State behaves as if
it were the owner and patron of the Organization and its &#8220;negotiations&#8221;
are little more than threats and repressive moves along with prodigious
defamation campaigns which one can only describe as media terrorism.<br>
      <br>
For the United Nations to become an authentic Organization, it would
require all Member States, especially the most powerful and influential
to really commit themselves to world Peace, the eradication of war,
hunger and poverty from this world. Those, after all, were the
objectives for which the United Nations was created and, by signing its
Charter, Member States committed themselves to dedicate their best
efforts to achieving those ends.<br>
      <br>
For more than thirty years now, at least, it has been known that
eradicating hunger and extreme poverty is no longer an unreachable
utopia. The resources and scientific-technical know how exist to
achieve it. All that is missing is the political will to live in
brother and sisterhood, to love each other and to be always equal to
the demands of human solidarity. We would need also the political will
to meet the demands of respect, love and care for all living things and
of our Mother Earth.<br>
      <br>
I think there is no doubt that the greater part of the world's peoples
long for Peace and consider it the supreme good towards which we ought
to work. However, as we have already noted, one State exists for which
the supreme good, its raison d'être, is not Peace but power. A power of
domination and subjugation that we can only describe as diabolical,
because no means exist, however violent and criminal they may be, that
this State, which we normally identify, quite simply, with Imperialism,
is not prepared to use in order to achieve its objective of Full
Spectrum Dominance &#8211; the name given by the Pentagon to the military
strategy of controlling the whole planet and beyond. This, clearly, is
an objective that others have already tried before, without ever
managing to achieve it. According to the Pentagon itself, the agenda of
this objective is to control everything, everywhere, including the
seas, the earth, the air and even outer space and cyberspace.<br>
      <br>
When we talk about this kind of demented ambition, it is difficult not
to recall events as perverse and deserving of condemnation, events
which, indeed, can never be condemned enough, as those relating to
Hitler who, as Simone Weil has pointed out, committed in Europe crimes
that the European colonial powers had themselves committed for
centuries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Still, it is no
exaggeration to argue that Hitler, with all the evil he committed, was
never able to cause as much harm to humankind as the United States has
done and continues to do, exponentially, to a point that endangers the
continuance of the human species and the greater part of life on Earth.
The United States, its allies and NATO are a thousand times more
dangerous and blameworthy than Hitler himself.<br>
      <br>
In which case it remains difficult, however desirable it may be, to
imagine a different United States, integrated with the rest of the
human family, working for the Peace and global security and doing
everything possible to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty from this
Earth, of which they themselves are the main cause. Furthermore, we
would also like to see the United States attempt to respond seriously
and effectively to climate change, global warming and the serious
ecological problems of which, too, they have been the main cause. But,
one has to ask oneself, for how long are we going to wait before the
United States and its allies correct themselves and stop behaving like
the enemies of humanity, of life, of Mother Earth?<br>
      <br>
The essential perversity of Empire is not something that just happened,
as it were, by accident. It was something planned out, decided on by
the leading architects of the Cold War policy of containment,
themselves led by George F. Kennan, Director of the section of Policy
and Planning of the Department of State. In an internal foreign policy
document from 1948, classified as Top Secret, Kennan sums up what
should be the main objectives of US foreign policy during the creation
of Post War Empire which would become known as the American Century. <br>
      <br>
Kennan's thesis, now declassified, is startlingly clear. Selfishness
and greed were enthroned, while international solidarity was
characterized as a luxury among the &#8220;more serious and important&#8221;
priorities of the moment. Kennan wrote: &#8220;We need not deceive ourselves
that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world-benefaction&#8221;.
With these values and criteria, it was only to be expected that the
United States would always behave as the enemy of the values and
principles enshrined in the UN Charter.<br>
      <br>
Even so, the planners of the new foreign policy of the United States
were very conscious of the fact that at this stage of history, the word
&#8220;imperialism&#8221; had become politically repugnant.&nbsp; As William
Engdahl, well regarded the world over as an expert in international
relations and author of several best sellers, has commented: &#8220;The
architects of the post-war US-Dominated global order explicitly chose
not to call it an &#8216;empire&#8217;. Instead the U.S. would project its imperial
power under the guise of colonial &#8216;liberation&#8217;, support for &#8216;democracy&#8217;
and &#8216;free markets&#8217;. This is one of the most effective and diabolical
propaganda coups of modern times.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
For our part, we cannot afford the luxury of continuing to fool
ourselves. The United States may have signed the UN Charter, but it has
never shared its values and principles. It has never sought Peace
because it needs war in order to achieve its Full Spectrum Dominance,
which now stretches into outer space and into cyberspace. The United
States has never believed in the rule of law in international
relations, believing always in the law of the jungle, or in other words
that might makes right. It has never believed in the United Nations and
from its position as the most influential Member State in the
Organization has always used blackmail and threats when it has not been
supported in the genocides it has committed and continues committing, like
those against Nicaragua and, today, against Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>
      <br>
With its incomparable brain washing apparatus of media power, the
United States is now preparing the world psychologically to accept an
attack against Iran using the same logic it applied to Iraq and
Afghanistan, so as to seize more natural resources and put an ever
tighter ring fence around Russia, which is and has always been its
principal objective. The Empire's arrogance leads it to pay
insufficient attention to the possible consequences of its adventures. <br>
      <br>
With all respect to Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran is different. If the
United States forces have been unable to subdue Iraq and Afghanistan,
much less will they be able to subdue Iran. The consequences of this
new criminal adventure could be catastrophic, not just for Iran and its
neighboring countries, but also for the whole world. Something similar
could happen if the United States does not accept seriously the
principle of one indivisible China but instead continues in its madness
of trying to divide it so as eventually to break it up.<br>
      <br>
It seems to me that the time has come, as the great African
intellectual Ngugi Wa Thiong&#8217;o has said, to decolonize the mind,
ridding ourselves of domesticating ideas like the one that we need the
United States, just as slaves used to need their slave master
tormentors. The truth is, we need the United States like we need
poisoning by arsenic. Enough of denial and of not wanting to face
reality or call things by their real name.<br>
      <br>
The United Nations are not Nations truly United because the positions
of different Member States of the Organization are not the same with
regard to vital matters like war and Peace, hunger and poverty, climate
change, global warming and nuclear disarmament and with regard to
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all States. The
United States, the most influential country in the Organization and the
major systematic violator of all its norms and principles, has a
position diametrically opposed to that of the immense majority of
Member States. Its main allies are the United Kingdom, the majority of
European countries and Israel. The main weapon it depends on to impose
its will in the world is NATO. All of these, by allying themselves with
the Untied States, have turned themselves too into enemies of humanity,
of Peace, of life and Mother Earth.<br>
      <br>
From my point of view as a religious person and follower of Our Lord
Jesus of Nazareth, I am absolutely convinced that, according to
biblical language, the United States is severely diabolically
possessed. The world is passing through a truly apocalyptic moment.
Possibly not for the first time, but it could well be the last given
the immense and unprecedented destructive power of the Beast and the
apathy, apparent indifference and cowardice of those who say they
believe in God yet, faced with the duty of uniting and devising an
effective strategy of resistance, fail to do so. <br>
      <br>
We should all recognize with humility that Comandante Fidel Castro is
today the world's great prophet and moral and spiritual leader. His
Reflections are truly inspired and inspiring. On October 15th last, he
alerted us to the fact that all human life would be the collateral damage
of nuclear war today. And, permitting Our Lord Jesus to speak through
him, Fidel urges us: To have the courage to proclaim that all weapons,
nuclear or conventional, everything that serves to make war, should
disappear! Thank you Fidel for your courage and lifelong example!<br>
      <br>
All these reflections prompted me to say, at the conclusion of my
period as President of the General Assembly, that the UN has reached a
point where reforms and patches are not enough. It has to be reinvented
and it is as a contribution to this urgent task of reinvention that I
have dedicated myself over the last two years. I make the proposal
personally, as ex-President of the UN General Assembly, completely and
exclusively on my own responsibility and as someone interested in Peace
and the eradication of war, hunger, poverty and the abuse of our Mother
Earth without which we cannot live. The values I defend and have
defended all my life are the values of Our Lord Jesus which on
fundamentals I find absolutely compatible with the values of my sisters
and brothers, be they Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu or
Aymara, as I do all the religions of the world and the richest
ethical-philosophical traditions like Marxism, for example, which
promote correct relationships between everything that lives and
suffers. <br>
      <br>
If at some time &#8211; for God everything is possible &#8211; the United States
truly decides to return to the human family&nbsp; and, by way of proof,
dismantles NATO and its more than 1000 military bases spread over the
whole planet, proceeds seriously with the abolition of nuclear weapons,
the demilitarization of outer space and puts an end to its wars of
aggression, ends its criminal harassment of Cuba, suspending the
blockade and freeing the 5 Cuban heroes, I am sure that everyone will
celebrate and welcome them with open arms as sisters and brothers to
the bosom of the human family, since what motivates us is neither hate
nor a desire for revenge but only love and the desire for universal
sister and brotherhood. God will bless them and Peace, security and joy
will return to our world.<br>
      <br>
I think it is extremely urgent that we get to work on reinventing the
UN so it can really be what its name says and not an Organization
subject to any one patron, however rich and militarily powerful that
patron may be. On a personal level, I have wanted to reciprocate&nbsp;
the faith that the Member States placed in this humble servant when
they elected me for the 63rd period of sessions of the UN General
Assembly, by reflecting on the last two years and exchanging ideas with
individuals who seem to me among the best qualified to help prepare a
good, viable Proposal to reinvent the United Nations and turn it into
an effective instrument in the struggle for Peace, the eradication of
wars, hunger and extreme poverty from the Earth. A United Nations truly
democratized and demilitarized. With humility and much love we will
soon be presenting the proposal's latest version on our web site:
www.reinventingtheun.org <br>
      <br>
Once the proposal has been received it will be necessary to act swiftly
and take into account that its acceptance or rejection will have to be
decided among heads of State and Government. Sending it for
consideration by the Permanent Representatives at the UN would expose
it to a rapid death, trapped in the extensive web of procedural norms,
like those envisaged for &#8220;reforms&#8221; whose only purpose is to change
nothing. Negotiating it regionally among groups of the heads of State
and Government of the Group of 77 plus China could turn out to be
relatively straightforward and achievable with the necessary speed to
be able to submit it for approval to the General Assembly once it has
secured support from the Group of 77 plus China which, I am convinced,
many others countries will join.<br>
