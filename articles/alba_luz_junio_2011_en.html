              June 17th 2011</span><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Tortilla con Sal : There has been controversy over the legal
            background to the candidacy of President Ortega in the
            elections of November this year. Could you summarize the
            legal context for us?<br>
            <br>
            Dra. Alba Luz Ramos : In February 1996, the Supreme Court of
            Justice issued three judgements in relation to three appeals
            regarding Law 192, a partial reform of the political
            Constitution, that had been made by people affected by some
            prohibitions established in that law. So the Court in those
            three judgements of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd of February 1996
            laid down that it was an exclusive faculty of the Electoral
            Power, the Supreme Electoral Council to deal with everything
            relating to those prohibitions in the political
            Constitution. Everything relating to electoral matters, the
            Court said was of the competence of the Supreme Electoral
            Council.<br>
            <br>
            Based on that judgement, the President and the Mayors went
            to the Electoral Council and asked it to clarify Article 147
            of the Constitution relating to a prohibition applicable to
            some Nicaraguan citizens, like the President, the Vice
            President, the Mayors and the deputy Mayors. Something that
            did not affect members of the National Assembly or the
            Central American Parliament.<br>
            <br>
            So, in a world of equals, of citizens with equal rights to
            be elected some were discriminated against and some were
            not. Some were forbidden from being re-elected and others
            were free to be re-elected which led the appellants to seek
            a clarification of that prohibition established in the
            constitutional reform of 1995. In other words, that
            prohibition was not in the original Nicaraguan Constitution,
            the Constitution of 1987 which is the last National
            Constituent Assembly we had, the most recent originating
            Constituent Assembly held by us in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            All the other Constituent instances are derivative instances
            that made partial reforms to the Constitution. So the
            Supreme Electoral Council told them that in that moment they
            could not clarify that Article because they were not engaged
            then in an electoral process. Since that resolution by the
            Electoral Council is an administrative one, the appellants
            decided to resort to the Court for the Court to make clear
            whether that Article was in accordance with the other
            constitutional&nbsp; dispositions and above all with the
            original dispositions of the 1987 Constitution.<br>
            <br>
            It is on that basis that the Court, or rather the
            Constitutional Division of the Court, in its judgement No.
            504 of October 19th 2009, ruled that the original
            Constitution had not established that restriction for
            Mayors, Deputy Mayors, nor for the President or the
            Vice-President of the Republic and therefore, based on
            constitutional doctrine, the derived constituent instance
            could not have gone beyond what was laid out in the original
            constituent instance by establishing a restriction that
            damaged fundamental constitutional principles like the right
            to elect and be elected or the principle of equality before
            the law. Because it established a discrimination between one
            group of citizens, of equals, and left them in unequal
            conditions being among that same group of citizens with the
            right to be elected.<br>
            <br>
            Even so, the reformers removed that right for some people
            under certain circumstances while maintaining it for other
            people under those same circumstances and so violating the
            principle of equality that is established in a fundamental
            way as part of the fundamental rights in our original
            Constitution of 1987. For that reason, an antinomy arose
            that had to be resolved in favour of those fundamental
            principles established by the original Constitution based on
            German constitutional doctrine, a doctrine used by other
            countries too in order to resolve similar cases, as happened
            in Colombia and in Costa Rica in similar cases over
            prohibitions on re-election. Such was the fundamental basis
            of the judgement that was made. And the ruling does not
            derogate that article nor does it reform the Constitution as
            has been alleged because what the relevant Law of
            Recourse&nbsp; does is to declare that article inapplicable
            because there exists an antinomy between two constitutional
            principles.<br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, nor is this the first time that the Court
            has ruled on such constitutional antinomies. Other earlier
            rulings exist where the Court has ruled on antinomies. In a
            judgement of 2007, the Court ruled there was an antinomy
            between Article 138 of the Constitution and Article 174 and
            the Court ruled Article 138 to be inapplicable. Nor was that
            the first time the Court had ruled on such antinomies. Why
            do they arise? Because there have been constitutional
            reforms where the derived constituent instance has often
            gone further than its competence allows, because it cannot
            go beyond what has been established in the original
            Constituent instance.<br>
            <br>
            TcS : Is it possible to clarify the way in which the Court's
            Constitutional Division delivered its ruling?<br>
            <br>
            ALR : To deliver this judgement the Court's Constitutional
            Division called together all its magistrates. The
            magistrates Damasis Sirias, Ivan Escobar Fornos and Sergio
            Cuaresma did not attend. But all the Divisions of the court
            have deputy magistrates and the deputy magistrates did
            attend. That is why it is commonly alleged that the session
            was made up only of Sandinista magistrates. However, the
            Liberal magistrates were called upon but did not assist.<br>
            <br>
            But there is a ruling following ruling No. 504 of October
            19th 2009, which is the ruling we are discussing, and that
            is ruling No. 67 of March 8th 2010, in other words some
            months later, a ruling likewise of the Court's
            Constitutional Division where these Liberal magistrates
            Sirias, Cuaresma and Escobar Fornos did take part and in
            which are used exactly the same arguments that were used in
            the ruling that declared inapplicable the reformed Article
            147 of the political Constitution. And furthermore, mention
            is made in this judgement of ruling No. 504 of October 2009.
            And I'd like to read it so you can see that exactly the same
            arguments really were used. <br>
            <br>
            It reads, "In accordance with its supremacy, the constituent
            norm is the first mandate in the legal order to which
            constituted norms should conform, including, for them to be
            valid, derived constituent instances. When this does not
            happen there arises a conflict between ordinary derived
            norms and those of the derived constituent instances against
            the norms of the original constituent instance which through
            its supremacy, prevails over the others, even more so when
            dealing with the fundamental and supreme principles that
            inform our political Constitution gathered in the Preamble
            and in Articles One, Two, Five and Six of the Constitution,
            as we have sustained in our ruling and as this
            Constitutional Division of the Court has repeated in its
            ruling No. 504 when referring to the principle of popular
            sovereignty and the right to elect and be elected which
            cannot be changed by a derived constituent instance."<br>
            <br>
            This ruling is signed too by the Liberal magistrates. It
            uses the self same arguments of ruling No. 504 in relation
            to the matter of re-election and furthermore itself alludes
            to that ruling.<br>
