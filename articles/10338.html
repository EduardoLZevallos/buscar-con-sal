<p>Excellency<br />
António Guterres<br />
Secretary General of the United Nations</p>

<p>Excellency<br />
Volkan bozkir<br />
President of the 75th Period of Sessions of the General Assembly</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen Representatives<br />
of the Member States</p>

<p>1. Receive the fraternal greetings of the People of Nicaragua, from President-Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra and the Comrade Vice-President Rosario Murillo, with a message of Peace, Health and Prosperity for the Peoples and Governments that make up the United Nations.</p>

<p>2. We meet during exceptional times caused by the Pandemic that affects Humanity, reiterating our solidarity and condolences with families around the world, who suffer the consequences of COVID-19.</p>

<p>3. The Pandemic has put humanity on edge and could further aggravate the existing crises, hunger and malnutrition, poverty, inequality, unemployment, climate change, all as a result of an unjust economic system which denigrates human beings.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>4. We commemorate 75 years of our Organization, and Humanity continues to cry-out for Peace, Justice, Security and a comprehensive response from the United Nations System, for the benefit of Humanity.</p>

<p>5. The re-founding of the United Nations Organization is urgent, as proposed on behalf of Nicaragua by the Nicaraguan Priest and Foreign Minister, Comrade Miguel D’Escoto, during his Presidency of this General Assembly in 2008.</p>

<p>6. We express our Hope and Commitment for this necessary and obligatory transformation, with the re-founding and democratization of the United Nations and its Organs to act for the benefit of the peoples and not of the hegemonic powers.</p>

<p>7. We are sure that the peoples are advancing, building, with Vigor and Hope, a New World Model with Justice, Equity, Multilateralism, to guarantee International Peace and Security and the Common Good, in compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

<p>8. We are entering the last decade of action to comply with the 2030 Agenda and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, and to achieve these goals, we must join forces, to have a true global alliance that can counteract the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other pandemics<br />
imposed by some powers to the detriment of peace, international security, the independence and sovereignty of the States and the self-determination of the Peoples.</p>

<p>9. Nicaragua will continue to promote a culture of peace, of peaceful coexistence among the sister countries that make up the United Nations, and we will continue to be a factor of stability, peace and security in Central America and the region.</p>

<p>10. We also call for a continuation of our global efforts for regular, safe and orderly migration.</p>

<p>11. Although the challenges posed by the Pandemic are very complex, we cannot forget the existential threat of climate change, which remains latent as a consequence of Savage Capitalism. It is urgent to ensure the survival of the human species, the life and rights of Mother Earth.</p>

<p>12. Due to its peaceful disposition, Nicaragua also advocates for a general and complete disarmament, and is in favor of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>13. The illegal Unilateral Coercive Measures imposed by the United States against various Peoples must cease immediately, in order to guarantee stability, Peace and the Development of families.</p>

<p>We denounce and condemn the repetition of attacks in an uninterrupted and cruel war against our Peoples, and in particular against Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, in a pattern, a model and a design based on foreign interests, outlined in the interference and interventionist Policies of the Empires, violating the human rights of the peoples.</p>

<p>We denounce and condemn the aggression that the worthy people of Cuba suffer through the brutal economic, political and commercial blockade, reaffirming our permanent solidarity with the Legacy of Comandante Fidel Castro, with Army General Raúl Castro and with the President of Sovereign Cuba, Brother Miguel Díaz-Canel.</p>

<p>We reiterate our firm support for the Sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, that suffers a cowardly, brutal and criminal attack by the North American empire and we ratify our firm and steadfast defense of the sovereignty and the right of the Bolivarian people, the people of Comandante Hugo Chávez, headed by Comrade Nicolas Maduro Moros, legitimate President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whom in an unequal struggle, heroically resists with the Great Civilian-Military Unit.</p>

<p>14. These Coercive and Aggressive Policies of the Empires constitute the true obstacle to the eradication of Poverty and to advance towards Sustainable Development. In times of Pandemic, these measures become a crime against humanity, by those who impose them.</p>

<p>15. The United Nations must focus on the welfare of the Human Being. Nicaragua rejects the politicization of the United Nations System, promoted mainly by the United States Government, which intends to turn its Organs into instruments at the service of its interests, in order to destabilize countries that do not submit to its imperial dictates.</p>

<p>16. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights does not act with justice and equity toward our country, turning its oral updates and reports into intentionally politicized content.</p>

<p>17. In addition to presenting worrisome and serious methodological deficiencies, their reports are constructed from sources exclusively opposed to the Nicaraguan Government, reproducing information only from some NGOs and media outlets directly linked to the failed attempted coup of 2018.</p>

<p>18. We demand from these Organizations created by the World, as the United Nations Organization was created 75 Years ago, behaviors consistent with International Law, with the Purposes and Principles of the very same United Nations Charter, in order to ensure Respect for Human Dignity, Security, Harmonious Coexistence and Life.</p>

<p>19. We demand that they take into account all perspectives and all Rights, strengthening Dialogue and Peace, in a World so in need of Harmony and the Peaceful Resolution of all conflict.</p>

<p>Mr. President,</p>

<p>20. Nicaragua advocates the decolonization of the continent with the independence of Puerto Rico and the restitution of the sovereignty of the Maldives Islands to the Republic of Argentina.<br />
21. Nicaragua advocates the formation of the two States, the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, living in Peace and Harmony, with East Jerusalem as its Capital, in accordance with the 1967 borders approved in the corresponding General Assembly Resolutions and the Security Council of the United Nations.</p>

<p>22. We ratify our invariable will to continue supporting the just struggle of the noble Saharawi People for their self-determination and respect for their dignity and rights as a sovereign nation.</p>

<p>23. Our Government of Reconciliation and National Unity expresses its invariable support for the cause of the Syrian People in their struggle, defending their Dignity and fighting against foreign aggression and international terrorism.</p>

<p>24. We greet the Brotherly People of Iran, strengthening our bilateral relations in all fields of mutual interest, in defense of Peace, Sovereignty and peaceful coexistence.</p>

<p>25. We condemn the North American hegemonic political aggressions that threaten the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and the military, economic and commercial threat against the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We must defend the principles of dialogue and negotiation and avoid the use or the threat of the use of force, basic principles of the United Nations.</p>

<p>Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of Delegation:<br />
26. Today our urgent commitment is to strengthen the essential pillars of multilateralism. We must watch over and defend International Law and the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. Nicaragua believes that only united, with solidarity and love, with cooperation and without selfishness, can we triumph in the face of the great challenges that humanity faces.</p>

<p>27. Nicaragua expresses its firm support for the theme that will guide our work in this 75th Period of Sessions: "The future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism."</p>

<p>28. The Pandemic that affects all countries has revealed the need to create a new International Economic Model, based on inclusion, equity and justice, prioritizing health, as a universal right of humanity; demanding that the resources that are destined for war, are available for life and for peace.</p>

<p>29. Faced with this Pandemic, the application of the principle of Universality is essential for humanitarian reasons so that Taiwan can participate in the corresponding mechanisms and meetings of the United Nations System.</p>

<p>Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation:</p>

<p>30. Together we must build a United Nations Organization at the service of Humanity. Building a better world is possible, and it is what all our Peoples demand with justice.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
