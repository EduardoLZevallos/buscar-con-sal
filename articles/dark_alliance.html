      <br>
December 10th this year will be the sixth anniversary of the death of
Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Gary Webb. Webb wrote a series of
articles in the late 1990s revealing that the CIA facilitated large
scale narcotics imports from Latin America into the United States
during the 1980s. Following those articles, Webb's career was destroyed
by a campaign of professional vilification led by the New York Times,
the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. But Webb's account was
later vindicated by reports from the CIA and the Justice Department,
reports that were barely covered at all by the New York Times.<br>
      <br>
From Gary Webb to Judith Miller<br>
      <br>
The same New York Times that covered up for the CIA by trashing Gary
Webb also published false propaganda by writers like Judith Miller used
to justify the criminal destruction of Iraq. It is absurd to expect
honest coverage of foreign affairs from the New York Times. Blake
Schmidt's November 13th article, "A Dispute in Nicaragua Reopens Old
Wounds", confirms that truth and also confirms that Judith Miller-style
journalism is alive and well at&nbsp; the New York Times. <br>
      <br>
Before going on to point out the dishonesty of Schmidt's article, here
is part of the self-exculpatory apology the New York Times editors
wrote to their readers following the Miller fiasco buried away on the
inside pages of its edition of May 26th 2004.
(http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0526-15.htm) <br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>"..we have found a number of instances of coverage
that was not as
rigorous as it should have been. In some cases, information that was
controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently
qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged. Looking back, we wish we
had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims as new evidence
emerged &#8212; or failed to emerge.<br>
        <br>
The problematic articles varied in authorship and subject matter, but
many shared a common feature. They depended at least in part on
information from a circle of Iraqi informants, defectors and exiles
bent on "regime change" in Iraq, people whose credibility has come
under increasing public debate in recent weeks." </blockquote>
      <br>
      <br>
Substitute "Nicaragua" or "Cuba" or "Venezuela" for "Iraq" and you have
an exactly similar situation in relation to the New York Times'
coverage of Latin America in general and - in the case of Blake
Schmidt's article - of Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's political opposition - now very clearly in a minority -
spearheaded by embittered, unscrupulous intellectuals like Carlos
Fernando Chamorro and&nbsp; electorally-nowhere politicians like
Edmundo Jarquin, Chamorro's brother-in-law, relentlessly promote
counterfactual propaganda about Nicaragua. The fundamental propaganda
line is that the Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega seeks to impose a
corrupt family dictatorship in Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
Collapse of the Nicaraguan opposition<br>
      <br>
Schmidt's article acknowledges what even right wing political polls
confirm. The Nicaraguan opposition parties are in complete disarray,
desperately trying to cobble together a plausible candidacy for the
November 2011 presidential elections. Schmidt points out that President
Ortega has around 45% popular support in national opinion polls. But
neglects to note that between 25% to 30% of people when asked how they
might vote are undecided. <br>
      <br>
That means the political opposition in Nicaragua are currently
struggling to consolidate support at or below just 30% of the
Nicaraguan electorate. Schmidt's article misleads by omission, what the
New York Times editors in their Miller disavowal call "insufficiently
qualified" information. The outstanding news story in Nicaragua is the
categorical collapse of the Nicaraguan political opposition to the
Sandinista-led coalition government. Blake Schmidt and his disingenuous
editors at the New York Times take that reality and invert it into a
Sandinista push for dictatorship.<br>
      <br>
An interesting aspect of the New York Times article is that the text
focuses almost exclusively on this "Ortega dictatorship" angle. The
clear reason for that skewed, counterfactual focus is that in every
area of Nicaragua's national life the current Nicaraguan government has
been exceptionally successful. The government has reduced poverty and
sustained investment through the worst international recession for
decades. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua enjoys record levels of exports. The Sandinista government
has broadened access to education and health care. Within little more
than a year, it had resolved the desperate energy crisis inherited on
taking office. It has reactivated the country's all-important
agricultural economy. All this and much more explains Daniel Ortega's
positive poll ratings. None of those achievements figure in Blake
Schmidt's article.<br>
      <br>
Judith Miller-style invention<br>
      <br>
The underlying intellectual dishonesty of Blake Schmidt's article
culminates in the article's last paragraph with a blatant fabrication :
"Vice President Jaime Morales Carazo said in an interview that the
re-election of Mr. Ortega could lead to dictatorship or conflict,
adding that he would step down if Mr. Ortega won again." <br>
      <br>
Inquiring readers might ask why Schmidt offers no direct quotation if
Morales Carazo spoke in an interview. The alleged remarks, if true,
would be a devastating indictment by Nicaragua's Vice-President of the
President with whom he currently serves. The answer to this obvious
question appeared in Nicaragua's centre right El Nuevo Diario of
November 16th. <br>
      <br>
There, Vice President Morales Carazo is quoted as follows, " 'I have
never said in any interview that the re-election of Ortega could lead
to a dictatorship or conflict' nor 'added that I would step down if
Se&ntilde;or Ortega were to win again.' " (1) So it seems the reason no
direct quote appears to back up Schmidt's account is that his report of
the Nicaraguan Vice-President's remarks is a fabrication. <br>
      <br>
On the one hand sits reported speech - supposedly from an interview and
yet without a direct quote - written by an ambitious young reporter,
reviewed by editorial staff with long-standing animosity to Daniel
Ortega. Against that, is the word of a genial veteran centre-right
politician widely respected for his courage, sincerity and honesty
across the political spectrum in Nicaragua and, too, in the United
States, whose government funded Morales Carazo's Contra to fight the
Sandinistas during the 1980s. <br>
      <br>
Scene-setting in coordination with the US right wing<br>
      <br>
The balance there does not tip in favour of the New York Times. Nor is
it likely to have been a coincidence that on November 17th following
Schmidt's article, extreme right-wing politicians and organizations
held a conference on "Dangers in the Andes" from which Venezuela's
right wing daily El Universal reported comments by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
soon to be chairperson of the Congressional House Committee on Foreign
Affairs. <br>
      <br>
Ros-Lehtinen is a long time supporter of anti-Castro terrorists Luis
Posada Corrales and
Orlando Bosch, both self-acknowledged mass murderers. According to El
Universal, Ros Lehtinen asserted, "The United States must cooperate
with its partners in the region to fight 'the decline of democratic
freedoms and human rights,' led by the governments of Venezuela,
Bolivia, Nicaragua and Ecuador..." (
http://english.eluniversal.com/2010/11/17/en_pol_esp_ros-lehtinen-critici_17A4742091.shtml)<br>
      <br>
Schmidt's article nicely set up the media commentary scene for the
"Danger in the Andes" conference. It permitted delegates to answer
reporters' questions about the conference with possible lines like,
"well, as the New York Times reported on November 13th, even
Nicaragua's Vice President regards dictatorship in Nicaragua as a real
danger....." The timing and high government propaganda content of the
New York Times article confirms the view that the Obama
administration's claims to want a new relationship with Latin America
are fake. A regional offensive by the US government and its allies is
well underway against progressive governments in the region.<br>
      <br>
Meretricious double standards<br>
      <br>
The bulk of Schmidt's article consists of a meretricious, random
build-up of facts taken out of context, juxtaposed with opinions cited
to reinforce the article's tendentious underlying double standards.
Here, a reasonably thorough but by no means complete analysis follows
for those interested enough to look at the nuts and bolts of this New
York Times exercise in psy-warfare. But two obvious double standards
stand out.<br>
      <br>
Firstly, while the New York Times and its writer Blake Schmidt take for
granted the wheeling and dealing that is an integral part of the US
political and legal system, they apply a different standard to
Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan opposition deride what they call the "Pacto"
or the "Deal" between the Sandinistas and former President Arnoldo
Aleman's wing of the Liberal opposition in Nicaragua. What they are
referring to is an operational understanding between those two
political forces which continue to represent an overwhelming majority
of opinion in the country. <br>
      <br>
That tacit agreement has enabled Nicaragua's political and legal system
to function since the late 1990s. It is difficult to see what
difference there is between that agreement and what the US media
approvingly refer to as "bipartisan consensus" in the United States.
Schmidt and his editors resolutely omit that fundamental political
reality in Nicaragua, making it impossible for anyone not familiar with
Nicaragua to understand the events of the last three years.<br>
      <br>
The second glaring double standard applied in Schmidt's article is in
relation to development cooperation aid from Venezuela. If one looks at
development cooperation aid to Nicaragua over the last few years in
terms of loans and grants, the country's non governmental sector has
received well over a billion dollars from North America and Europe. But
it is hard to see what that money has achieved apart from keeping a
cosseted NGO managerial class in overpaid jobs and fancy 4-wheel drive
vehicles. Not one cent of that money has been submitted to oversight by
the Nicaraguan legislature. <br>
      <br>
US or European or Nicaraguan corporate media outlets do not comment on
that fact. But foreign commentators on Nicaragua persistently parrot
Nicaraguan opposition demands that Venezuela's development cooperation
should be subject to oversight by the Nicaraguan legislature. That
cooperation has been delivered via solid private sector and cooperative
sector investment whose encouraging results are clear and well
documented by international organizations like UNESCO and the UN Food
and Agriculture Organization. Such double standards permeate Schmidt's
article. <br>
      <br>
Re-heating the Contra<br>
      <br>
Schmidt's article distorts the political reality in Nicaragua right
from the start, reporting, "President Daniel Ortega&#8217;s push to stay in
power using a contested interpretation of the Constitution has
reignited the fury of former contras who fought his Sandinista
government in the 1980s, with one former rebel taking up arms in the
mountains and another vowing to oust him at the polls." <br>
      <br>
The clear impression is that the report refers to large numbers of
former Contra fighters. An honest report would have qualified that
information - to use the NYT's own terminology - with adjectives like
"some", or adjectival phrases like "a few" or "a small minority of".
Thus, Schmidt leaves out the fact that former Contra fighters
overwhelmingly support, or at the very least accept, the Sandinista
FSLN party leadership against whom they fought over twenty years ago. <br>
      <br>
The Sandinista government has rapidly met longstanding neglected
demands of the great majority of those fighters for land, housing,
pensions and financial credit that previous right wing governments did
not. Only a minority of former Contra fighters still oppose the
government. Virtually none are talking about resorting to taking up
arms again, despite Nicaragua's history since the 1990s being plagued
by former Contra fighters taking up arms in order to demand economic
concessions from successive governments. <br>
      <br>
Government popularity<br>
      <br>
In the next paragraph, Schmidt writes "But in the absence of a
post-cold-war sponsor, Nicaragua&#8217;s opposition is struggling to
coordinate an electoral offensive against Mr. Ortega, whose approval
ratings rose to 45 percent last month with the help of his
Venezuelan-financed response to flooding that killed scores of people
and forced thousands to flee their homes." <br>
      <br>
The clear implication here is that the US might do well to step in and
help the Nicaraguan opposition, in line with the extreme right wing
"Danger in the Andes" conference agenda. Schmidt also suggests that
President Ortega's popularity only reached 45% as a result of the
government's effective response to the widespread social and
infrastructure problems caused by the untypical rainy season
culminating in severe flooding through September. <br>
      <br>
But President Ortega's popularity was already up in the 40% range
before that flooding and has shown steady improvement through 2009 to
date. President Ortega's popularity - tens of percentage points ahead
of any opposition politician - results from the broad range of
government policies starting on the first day he took office when he
slashed the salaries of Ministers and their senior officials. His
government immediately implemented policies of free education and free
health services. <br>
      <br>
Since that time in January 2007, the Nicaraguan government has received
substantial funding from all the usual international financial
institutions active in the region. Traditional aid donors in North
America, Asia and Europe have continued long standing support, despite
politically motivated efforts by the US and European governments to
suspend aid so as to force political concessions. Foreign cooperation
with Nicaragua also comes from a wide range of other investment sources
ranging from Taiwan, Vietnam and South Korea, to Iran, Libya and
Russia, to Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. <br>
      <br>
A faithful report on the reasons for President Ortega's popularity
would recognize the solidity and breadth of Nicaragua's foreign
economic, financial and commercial relations. In comparison to the
lack-lustre, ideologically hidebound policies of previous
administrations since 1990, these relations have been positively
transformed under the FSLN government. Schmidt's article ignores all
this broad-based, hard won support, mentioning only aid from Venezuela,
as if he were writing from a US State Department propaganda crib.<br>
      <br>
The Nicaraguan opposition and reconciliation<br>
      <br>
Apart from the general disinformation from one paragraph to the next,
the juxtaposition of remarks tells its own story too. Paragraph three
of Schmidt's report quotes septuagenarian aspiring presidential
candidate Fabio Gadea saying &#8220;Ch&aacute;vez is propping up Ortega&#8217;s
dictatorship&#8221;. One might have expected some balanced response to that,
in the spirit of the New York Times' alleged anxiety to sufficiently
qualify controversial information. <br>
      <br>
But no. The next paragraph reinforces Gadea's unlikely claim to be
defending democracy. Only much later, in a different context, does
Schmidt mention that Gadea is disgraced former President Arnoldo
Aleman's brother-in-law and a leading member of Aleman's political
party all through the abysmally corrupt administrations of Aleman and
Aleman's successor as president, Enrique Bola&ntilde;os. Fabio Gadea
himself omits that Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez also provided not
insubstantial development aid to the Aleman administration for
infrastructure projects. Schmidt appears to be too ignorant of that
history to point it out.<br>
      <br>
After quoting another factitious threat from the lone former Contra
rebel-in-the-mountain, Schmidt tries and fails to link that isolated
figure in some meaningful way to the Contra War of the 1980s. He
writes, "Nicaragua has spent the past two decades trying to heal from
the civil war that tore the country apart and left 35,000 people dead.
Mr. Ortega, elected in 2006 with a former contra as his running mate,
has distributed roofing materials, pensions and property titles to
families of contras who turned in weapons as part of a 1987 peace
accord." <br>
      <br>
Schmidt completely erases the role of the United States in fomenting,
financing and directing that war. By imposing ahistorical
discontinuities, he misrepresents extraordinarily disparate and complex
phases of Nicaragua's recent history which involved persistent
uprisings of one kind or another well into the current century. Schmidt
fails to note that President Ortega has indeed successfully reconciled
erstwhile bitter enemies who fought each other during that US
government fomented war.<br>
      <br>
Assisted by former determined foe Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo,
President Ortega has been successful in national reconciliation because
he reversed the systematic betrayal of Contra fighters by
double-dealing earlier governments whose leaders are now directing
Nicaragua's opposition parties. That is another reason why President
Daniel Ortega is so far ahead of those opposition leaders in the
opinion polls. <br>
      <br>
People in Nicaragua generally welcome the steady transformation being
made in Nicaragua by the Sandinista government in favour of the
impoverished majority. That positive change is being effected
regardless of people's political affiliation. None of this reality is
apparent from Schmidt's account, despite isolated allusions to the
Sandinista government's anti poverty focus. He is self-evidently
peddling Nicaraguan opposition and US State Department propaganda.<br>
      <br>
Presidential re-election and the Supreme Court<br>
      <br>
Schmidt moves on to the issue of presidential re-election but again
fails to provide sufficient qualification for the controversial
information he imparts. He writes, "Lacking the votes in Congress to
amend the Constitution, Mr. Ortega turned to the Supreme Court. Six
judges from the governing Sandinista party ruled that the
constitutional ban did not apply to Mr. Ortega, but the ruling
immediately caused an uproar because it was made when no opposition
judges were present."<br>
      <br>
In the first place, Schmidt fails to place the issue of re-election in
its regional context. Secondly, he fails to acknowledge how the Supreme
Court dealt previously with another politically sensitive case, the
exoneration of Arnoldo Aleman, permitting him to resume normal
political life. That absence of crucial qualifying information operates
in line with Nicaraguan opposition propaganda, making President
Ortega's efforts to secure the right to re-election seem extremely
sinister. <br>
      <br>
In fact, US allies like former President Uribe of Colombia and former
President Arias of Costa Rica in recent years both used constitutional
procedures to secure their right to re-election. Colombia's Supreme
Court eventually found that President Uribe had suborned at least one
legislator in order to get sufficient votes to push through a change to
the Colombian constitution enabling Uribe to run for re-election. Oscar
Arias's first attempt in 2000 to change Costa Rica's constitution so as
to allow him to run for re-election failed. In 2003, aggressive
lobbying by his supporters lead the Costa Rican Supreme Court finally
to rule in his favour.<br>
      <br>
The precedent of the Nicaraguan Supreme Court ruling, exonerating
Arnoldo Aleman, in 2009 is important because it was the unusual absence
of Sandinista magistrates that made it possible. Similarly , the
unusual absence of Liberal magistrates when the Constitutional Division
of Nicaragua's Supreme Court ruled on Daniel Ortega's right to
re-election suggests the strong probability of a tacit agreement by
both sides similar to the one very clearly involved in the exoneration
of Arnoldo Aleman in January 2009.<br>
      <br>
One also wonders why Schmidt fails to note that in September this year
the Supreme Court sat in plenary session. The session included Liberal
party aligned deputy magistrates substituting for absent Liberal
colleagues. That plenary session ratified the decision taken earlier by
the Constitutional Division in favour of Daniel Ortega's right to stand
for re-election, as well as that of all Nicaragua's local government
mayors. <br>
      <br>
Nor does Schmidt note that all bar one of the various opposition party
aligned officials returned to their posts early in November. In the
case of the Supreme Court, not one of the returning Liberal magistrates
demurred from a single ruling made in their absence, including the
ruling on President Ortega's right to re-election. That in itself
represents yet more confirmation of the tacit agreement between the
respective authorities of the Sandinista FSLN party&nbsp; and the
Aleman Liberals.<br>
      <br>
The Constitution and a divided opposition<br>
      <br>
Schmidt goes on to write "Mr. Ortega then had the Constitution
reprinted in September to include an old &#8212; and, some argue, expired &#8212;
clause that sanctioned the extensions. Sandinista judges have also
replaced the Supreme Court president with one of their own, rounding
out Mr. Ortega&#8217;s control of the court."<br>
      <br>
The facts are that the National Assembly's Executive Board ordered the
reprinting of the Nicaraguan Constitution. Daniel Ortega does not have
the constitutional authority to do so. The decision was taken by the
Executive Board with, again, the mysterious absence of the Board's
Aleman Liberal party members. This point is important because Schmidt
gives the completely false impression that President Ortega
consistently violates the Nicaraguan constitution. The opposite is
true, he follows it to the letter.<br>
      <br>
Similarly, Alba Luz Ramos assumed the functions of the outgoing
President of the Supreme Court in June 2010 since she was the most
senior magistrate. It was an uncontroversial procedure consonant with
long standing practice. Aleman Liberal party aligned magistrates
subsequently abandoned normal working, because they objected to a
Presidential decree extending officials' periods of office pending a
vote in the legislature. But&nbsp; they continued to negotiate
their differences with their Sandinista colleagues. Luz Ramos was
confirmed
as President by her colleagues on the Supreme Court in October. That
election was ratified by the reincorporation to the court of the
previously absent Liberal magistrates in early November, with no
demurral on their part as regards serving under Luz Ramos.<br>
      <br>
In fact, every constitutional, legal or legislative move by the
Sandinista government so far has been invariably in strict accordance
with the letter of the Nicaraguan Constitution. The clause referred to
by Schmidt was one included in the Constitution to facilitate a period
of transition in 1990 when the national elections were brought forward
from November to February so as to facilitate an end to the decade-long
war. The early transition meant that the periods of various senior
official posts would expire, leaving those offices in an institutional
limbo. While other components of that Constitution were duly revoked by
the legislature, that clause was never revoked, remaining valid
until&nbsp;
such time as it is.<br>
      <br>
The Nicaraguan opposition have completely failed to use their de facto
majority in the National Assembly to resist the FSLN government's
astute political and legal strategy. But none of that fundamental
context figures in Schmidt's report. At no point does Schmidt mention
that, on paper,&nbsp; the Nicaraguan opposition have a majority in the
legislature, albeit short of the two-thirds majority needed to change
the Constitution. That is the root cause of the political impasse that
has dogged Nicaraguan political life ever since the 2006 national
elections.<br>
      <br>
Even so, the Nicaraguan opposition have failed to mobilise effectively
around that majority. Their failure stems from the bitter division of
the two main opposition currents - one supporting Eduardo Montealegre,
and one supporting Arnoldo Aleman - over strategy. Aleman's supporters
have a bipartisan stop-go working relationship with the Sandinistas. By
contrast, Eduardo Montealegre's supporters have little influence in
Nicaragua's institutions and have done all they can to sabotage normal
institutional life in the country. It is impossible to make sense of
events in Nicaragua over the last two years without understanding that
reality.<br>
      <br>
Yet another omission in Schmidt's article is that the two main
opposition leaders are both in trouble over corruption charges. Despite
his January 2009 exoneration, Arnoldo Aleman still has other corruption
charges pending. Eduardo Montealegre is currently using his
parliamentary immunity to avoid indictment for multi-million dollar
fraud on charges resulting from an investigation by the country's
independent audit body, the Office of the Controller General. <br>
      <br>
Ever since January 2007, the country's legislature, the National
Assembly, has persistently held boycotts of the legislature's working
sessions, sometimes for months on end. All of this context explains yet
further why Daniel Ortega is relatively popular, while opposition
politicians are so discredited. Without that context, Blake Schmidt's
article offers a hopelessly skewed account of political events in
Nicaragua over the period about which he is writing. <br>
      <br>
Rather than offer a coherent narrative of recent developments, Schmidt
presents an aleatory concatenation of quotes and events which only
make&nbsp; sense given the false "Ortega dictatorship" logic he imposes
on them. He harps regularly on occasional episodes of reported
intimidation by Sandinista demonstrators. But he makes not a single
mention of various incidents since 2007 in which Liberal Party
politicians have used extremely violent demonstrations by their
supporters to try and get their way. <br>
      <br>
Finale - egregious omission and misrepresentation<br>
      <br>
Perhaps the strangest aspect of Schmidt's reporting is that he
mysteriously cuts off his account at the very point that the opposition
officials who had boycotted Nicaragua's institutions for several months
returned to normal working. This happened over a week before the byline
on Schmidt's article in the New York Times. That political shift is a
major development in Nicaraguan politics because it indicates a
dramatic change in the Liberal opposition parties' strategy. <br>
      <br>
Schmidt similarly omits to mention that all the opposition political
parties legally eligible to participate in the presidential elections
of 2011 have registered with the Supreme Electoral Council. All the
Nicaraguan opposition political parties have been saying for months
they would never participate in the 2011 electoral process unless the
electoral magistrates were changed. The electoral magistrates have not
changed. Even so, all the eligible Nicaraguan political parties have
duly registered with the Supreme Electoral Council. <br>
      <br>
The bewildering accumulation of misinformation by omission in Schmidt's
article continues right into the final paragraphs with a summary
account of the role of Venezuelan development cooperation within the
ALBA framework. Schmidt observes , "Mr. Ortega, who was president in
the 1980s but lost an election in 1990 as Soviet support waned, has
received at least $1.4 billion from Mr. Ch&aacute;vez in oil, aid and
investment to fuel his fight against poverty and illiteracy, figures
from the central bank show."<br>
      <br>
The general consensus is that President Ortega lost the 1990 election
because people were sick of the US government fomented Contra war and
the terrible suffering and privation people in Nicaragua endured as a
result. But that general consensus among Nicaraguans is inadmissible to
the New York Times. Schmidt rewrites Nicaraguan history and also offers
a cartoon strip account of the development cooperation relationship
between Venezuela and Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
In January 2007 Nicaragua joined what is now the Bolivarian Alliance
for the Peoples of the Americas (ALBA), a regional trade and
development cooperation framework of eight countries led by Venezuela
and Cuba. Nicaragua has benefited from a complex set of agreements
negotiated with its ALBA partners. Schmidt truncates that formal
process into the personal whim of&nbsp; President Hugo Chavez of
Venezuela. Despite the crude caricature, Schmidt is right to report
that ALBA has indeed helped Nicaragua with well over US$1 billion in
development cooperation support of various kinds since January 2007.<br>
      <br>
A genuine report would compare the amounts other bilateral and
multilateral development cooperation resources have contributed over
that same period. These add up to several billion dollars more. Schmidt
gives the impression that President Ortega is damagingly dependent on
Venezuelan development cooperation when that is not the case. The
current Sandinista government has a broad range of development
cooperation agreements with a number of countries and international
financial institutions of which, admittedly, Venezuela's is perhaps the
most important.<br>
      <br>
But the importance of Venezuela's development cooperation lies not in
the amount but rather in the terms on which it is offered, based on
socialist inspired humanitarian solidarity and cooperation and an
impulse for regional integration. Here too Schmidt spins another
Nicaraguan opposition-made yarn, "The money has expanded Mr. Ortega&#8217;s
political base and given him more of a stake in the economy through a
network of companies that blur the lines between his Sandinista party,
the state and the private sector, said Francisco Lainez, who founded
Nicaragua&#8217;s central bank."<br>
      <br>
It is undeniable that corporate funded political processes in the
United States have led to massive government (ie. taxpayer) bailouts of
private sector businesses. That reality has shown the utter confusion
in the United States between political parties, the State and the
private sector. In any healthy political body that would certainly be
cause, not just for legitimate concern, but for widespread criminal
prosecutions. It is far from clear why similar concerns to those
prompted by the collapse of the US economic system should be raised by
Venezuela's and Nicaragua's application of ALBA's sustainable
development model. <br>
      <br>
The ALBA model leverages the benefits of long term credit productively
invested by Nicaraguan and Venezuelan joint venture companies operating
in full compliance with Nicaraguan law. The funds channeled into
development cooperation programs and commercial investments in the
agribusiness and energy sectors are supervised by the relevant ALBA
institutions. Contrary to what Schmidt's chosen quote implies, the
companies are owned neither by Daniel Ortega nor by the Sandinista FSLN
party. <br>
      <br>
Close to the ignominious end of his extended disinformation exercise,
Schmidt throws out another gratuitous distortion of events in relation
to disputes over mismanagement in a few of Nicaragua's municipal
authorities. Schmidt refers to the Nicaraguan coordinator of the World
Bank related Social and Economic Investment Fund (FISE), Nelson Artola,
averring "He also leads the Sandinistas&#8217; carrot-and-stick approach to
building political support for Mr. Ortega&#8217;s re-election, distributing
Venezuelan aid and government funds to mayors who publicly back Mr.
Ortega. Less compliant mayors have been ousted, with the police
dragging one from his office in June after an eight-day standoff."<br>
      <br>
Schmidt neglects to point out that FISE is in fact a body funded in
large part by the World Bank. The Sandinista government's
administration of FISE is different from that of previous
administrations in that it is much less corrupt and far more
successful. Schmidt's reference to disputes with elected mayors has to
do with the Sandinista government's attempts to improve local
democracy, educating elected local government representatives about
their powers when faced with inefficient or corrupt mayors. <br>
      <br>
In at least two of the cases referred to by Schmidt the mayors were
members of the Sandinista FSLN. Schmidt's interpretation once more
turns the reality upside down to reinforce his article's false argument
that President Ortega's FSLN government is undemocratic and heading for
a dictatorship. That argument is topped off in the article's final
paragraph by Schmidt's disgraceful misrepresentation of the views of
Nicaragua's Vice President Jaime Morales.<br>
