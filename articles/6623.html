<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE<br />
FROM THE DELEGATION OF THE GRUN<br />
FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PEACE IN NICARAGUA<br />
<br />
Friday, June 7, 2019</strong></p>

<p><em>“Keep thy tongue from evil,<br />
 and thy lips from speaking guile.”</em></p>

<p><em> Depart from evil, and do good;<br />
 seek peace and pursue it.”</em></p>

<p><em>(From Psalm 34:13-14)</em></p>

<p>Yesterday, June 6, our People, through our Comandante Daniel, reiterated the Sacred Oath of Christian Love, Fraternal Peace and Common Good among all Nicaraguans.</p>

<p>We renewed those Vows yesterday, when we buried what hatred left of the physical body of our Bismarck, who was not only tortured to death, but also tortured and wounded his entire family by denying him the right to Christian Burial.</p>

<p>Yesterday, today and every day, the Nicaraguan people, the Faithful and Devout Families of Nicaragua, have demanded the condemnation of those crimes of hate, for those cruel, humiliating, degrading, inhuman and destructive acts, but of course, are not condemned by the elite; those very crimes or the attempt to subordinate Nicaraguans to the perversity and violent and destructive practices with which they sought to subjugate and bury us.</p>

<p>They have not only offended the Heart of the People with their inhuman silence, but they have defamed, slandered and established lying matrices of National and International Communications, propitiating losses and damages to the Good Image of this Motherland, which despite evil, remains undefeated, with the immense Spirit of Darío, of Sandino and of all the Fighters of Love and Peace who, throughout our history. have redeemed our Beautiful and Good Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the invincible Sandinista Membership, embodied in Bismarck de Jesus Martinez and the thousands of thousands of Heroic Fighters for Affection, Rights and Happiness of the People, sang once more to the Life, the Hope and the Certainty of the Blessings and Victories that God proclaims for our Beloved Nicaragua.</p>

<p>In this Month of June, in these Days of Tribute to the Triumphant Nicaraguan Flags of Dignity and Sovereignty and the National Sandinista Liberation Front, that has known and knows how to keep our National Flag intact, beautiful and clear as our Heaven; we declare ourselves in Permanent Session for Reconciliation, Peace, Security, Coming Together, Work, Faith and Life, firm and invincible with the entire of Nicaragua that wants and demands to Live with Rights, Wellbeing and Tranquility in our Christian Culture of Healthy, Simple Solidarity and of Good Heart.</p>

<p>We work in Permanent Session advancing in the fulfillment of our Commitments with the Nicaraguan Families:</p>

<p>    1. Before June 18, all persons detained for crimes committed as a result of last year´s violent and failed attempted coup d'état, will be released.</p>

<p>    2. From our Culture of Peace, we continue to grow with the Commissions for Reconciliation and Harmonious Coexistence, fostering the Common Good through joint efforts.</p>

<p>    3. The Plan for Safe Return, Social and Family Reintegration of our Nicaragua in Christian Solidarity, has welcomed many Nicaraguans who are already enjoying their Lives in Family and Community.</p>

<p>    4. The Programs derived from the Law for the Integral Attention to Victims are being developed and applied, without discrimination.</p>

<p>    Our Culture of Solidarity and Family and Community Values, guarantees with this Law, the careful treatment and Fraternal Affection without discrimination, of all those who have suffered Terrorism, crimes of hate, cruel, humiliating, degrading, inhuman and destructive treatment promoted by the attempted Coup.</p>

<p>    5. We are consolidating, in Freedom, Dignity and Fraternity, Knowledge and Respect for our Constitution, as well as the Laws and Institutions of our Independent and Sovereign Republic.</p>

<p>    Our Magna Carta represents the Values  of Dignity and Self-Determination contained in our Democracy, established 40 years ago, thanks to the Heroism of our People.</p>

<p>    6. We strengthen our Electoral Institutions by working on Plans and Programs to prepare</p>

<p>the National Elections of November 2021, in accordance with the Rules established by the Experts and Specialists in Electoral Systems and Processes throughout the World.</p>

<p>    7. Citizen Security, the essential mobilizations for Life, Work, Creative Economy, Trade, Education, Sports, Recreation, Social, Cultural, Religious and Community Activity, are all strengthened in compliance with the Rights that Our Constitution and Laws guarantee for each Person, Family and Community within our Nicaragua, Always Blessed and Free.</p>

<p>    8. Producers, Cooperatives, Traders, Business Leaders, Entrepreneurs and Workers, in all the Spaces of our open, inclusive, creative and vigorous Economic Model,</p>

<p>are mobilized in their various Activities, according to the Rights guaranteed by our Constitution.</p>

<p>    9. The National Economy, severely impacted by Coup Terrorism, requires everyone’s contribution toward the recovery and restoration of Stability and Growth.</p>

<p>    The Responsibility and Commitment of each and every one of us contributes to restore the Good Path that our Nicaragua, in Christian, Family and Community Solidarity, was undertaking before terrorist hatred and cruelty, darkened our Lives.</p>

<p>    Transcending the failed coup, the Efforts and the Victorious Energy of the Faith and Hope of the Nicaraguans, has allowed and will continue to allow that our Paths of Common Good may be illuminated by Honest Work, Solidarity, Security and Peace.</p>

<p>    10. Every day we express the rejection of the majority of our People against the Unilateral, Illegal and Coercive Political and Economic Measures that affect all our Rights.</p>

<p>    The Hard-Working Nicaraguan Families, of Good Heart and Good Faith, repudiate and reject those Measures that selfishly aim to continue harming our Shared Motherland.  Faced with those who impose this type of unjust and arbitrary measures, the Good Spirit of the Nicaraguan Majorities, who live with Optimism and Confidence in God, rises-up, in Times of Exclamation, Prayer and demands for Respect, Justice and Peace.</p>

<p>    11. In this Motherland of Peace and Good, we recognize ourselves as Fraternal, Dignified and Free Human Beings, whose Social, Cultural, Eco-nomic, Productive, Commercial, Labor and Business Activity must be developed with respect among us all, and in recognition of the Rights and Du-ties that the Constitution and Laws demand of Nicaraguans.</p>

<p>Our Economic and Social Model, our Democracy, our Political Culture enhances the Protagonism of Everyone, taking into account Diversity, Plurality and Differences of Vocation, Activity and Profession. Encouraged, motivated by our Beliefs and Devotions, we are counting on the Vitality of Everyone to build the Present and Future for Family, with Justice, Equity and Shared Prosperity.</p>

<p>We feel proud and grateful to God, of the Paths that we undertake, Prodigious, Miraculous, Blessed as our Motherland. We seek to advance together, to continue learning together, to continue growing together, and to further elevate our Consciousness of "Vibrant, strong, passionate, proud people; People who have the conscience of being alive, and who gathering their energies in a bright light, for the vigorous Motherland demonstrates that it can bravely present in her right hand, the steel of war or the olive tree of peace."</p>

<p>With Darío we also say:</p>

<p><em>“The Heart of Heaven, beats for Victories<br />
 of this Life that is both Battle<br />
 and Glory”</em></p>

<p>Nicaragua is made of Vigor and Glory and is made for Freedom, for Humanity, for Happiness!</p>
