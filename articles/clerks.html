Baudelaire addressed his reader in the poem of that name with the
tautological salute, "you, hypocrite reader" he was recognising
people's unavoidable moral, emotional and intellectual discontinuities.
Few evade for long the knot of contradiction, fictions and, sometimes,
downright lies people use to lend coherence and identity to what makes
up the person they are. Socio-economic realities leave people dealing
with the consequences of class conflict and the practical effects on
others of what they do.<br><br>A handy fiction promoted in recent years
among progressive people - politicians, intellectuals, solidarity or
community workers, activists of all kinds - has been the suggestion
that it is possible to talk about a "coordinator" class that is
generically different from a "managerial" class. Perhaps in the last 60
years the most influential description of the managerial class has been
James Burnham's, the former North American revolutionary turned
reactionary author of "The Managerial Revolution". Wikipedia reports
that towards the end of his life, Burnham received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan.<br><br>So it is understandable
that progressive people seek to avoid being identified with that type
of managerial class, capitalist, neoliberal. But the effort to
establish a more benign category of managers, by calling them a
"coordinator class" fails to overcome the brute fact that the members
of that class do indeed manage limited resources and do definitely
control access to those resources. A change of name still leaves those
people with the perennial managerial dilemma : how to negotiate
democratically the difference between what they, the managers, think
and want and what the majority think and want.<br><br>That deep
political dilemma shows up very clearly in the processes of
intellectual production and distribution. There, people use many means
of expression - talking, singing, painting, drawing, filming, making
music - to define or represent what people may be thinking or what they
may feel. One can work a rich seam of fictions and hypocrisies there,
in among the managerial control of those forms of expression. In future
it is likely that people will look back on the year 2008 as a classical
departure point for that kind of cultural-historical mining. The
election of pig-in-a-poke President Barack Obama will take pride of
place. But one could argue that elections more decisive than the US
plutocrats' continuity beauty contest took place in Venezuela and in
Nicaragua.<br><br>In the United States President-elect Obama managed to
sell his false, trite message of "change" to the tens of millions of
people who so longed for an end to the waste of financial, material and
human resources in endless wars, in an economy that every year leaves
most families worse off, in a society unable to give its people a good
education or guarantee them adequate health care. Even before taking
office, Obama has made more than clear, by naming Hilary Clinton as
Secretary of State and leaving Robert Gates as Secretary for Defence,
that the militarism, the stupendous spending on armaments and the wars
too are going to carry on much the same. US military operations in Iraq may
be wound down but only so as to crank up aggression elsewhere.<br><br>To
lead his economic team, Obama has named Lawrence Summers and Timothy
Geithner. Obama continues to be advised by Robert Rubin, a director of
Citigroup, one of the Wall Street monsters responsible for the collapse
of the United States financial system. Rubin and Summers figured among
the architects of the financial deregulation that was a main cause of
that collapse.&nbsp;Geithner and Summers were responsible for International
Monetary Fund and World Bank policies during those institutions'
disastrous interventions in Russia and Asia during the regional crises
of the 1990s.<br><br>So there is not going to be any change in the
economic priorities of the US plutocracy, just a change in the figure
of the President. Spectacularly destructive and wasteful military
aggression will continue. With Hilary Clinton as Secretary of State one
can expect policies towards the world very similar to the ones pursued
by Condoleezza Rice and John Negroponte, perhaps taking an unwelcome
renewed interest in Latin America. The crises in Mexico and Colombia
will deepen. The low intensity wars against progressive governments -
especially Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela - will intensify. The
diverse modalities of US diplomacy's habitual hypocrisy and sadism -
for example against Cuba and Haiti - will probably continue perhaps with
some cosmetic nips and tucks.<br><br>As well as the unprecedented,
enormous amounts of money they spent, the US plutocracy also had to
waste a great amount of talent in order to sell continuity as if it
were change. One can say the same of another variety of fraud, the one
used to undermine the triumph of the Frente Sandinista de Liberación
Nacional in the municipal elections of November 9th in Nicaragua. A
great deal of money and ingenious planning went into mounting the
dishonest allegations of electoral fraud.<br><br>In both cases, there
was plenty of complicit self-delusion by large chunks of the sectors
one normally thinks of as progressive or radical. In the US many
progressive people, opposed to the war in Iraq, promoters of a more
just society, the labour unions, the ethnic minorities, convinced
themselves that Obama represented genuine change. They did not go to
vote saying "we know Obama represents no change, but the other
candidate is worse..." They accepted and approved the fraud perpetrated
by Obama and his team. As others have pointed out, that team won the
Advertiser of the Year 2008 award from Advertising Age magazine,
awarded on behalf of the most important advertising businesses in the
United States.<br><br>In Nicaragua, it was a little different. On
losing the local elections quite spectacularly, the biggest opposition
party, with its candidate for mayor of the capital city Managua in the
lead, cried "fraud!". With their allies in the centre-right Movimiento
Renovador Sandinista, they mounted a national and international media
offensive. The main false accusations were, absence of electoral
observers, anomalies in the organization of the polls and of the count,
and the violence in the days following the elections.<br><br>It is an
open question whether that campaign did in fact fail, because its
objectives were not clear. At first sight it looks like a hopeless
flop. The campaign did not manage to force a national recount of the
votes or a review of the results. But perhaps that was not the
campaign's main idea. It seems likely as events have unfolded that a
main objective of the opposition in crying "fraud!" was to firm up the
shaky pretexts offered by the US and European governments, on the basis
of which they have been attacking Nicaragua's Sandinista government for
months now. Thanks to the fake opposition accusations they can now go
ahead more plausibly and destabilize the successful government
programme of President Daniel Ortega.<br><br>The allegations of fraud
are transparent lies. There were indeed prestigious and authoritative
international election observers, representing electoral authorities
from all over Latin America. The anomalies in the polls were
insignificant. A few local problems with party representatives, some
polling stations closing early, the obvious planting of election
material found in a rubbish tip, a difference in the figures on the
electoral authority's web site and the results published in the local
press. (That last matter resulted from the different&nbsp; legal
treatment accorded to the voting results in their different stages :
preliminary provisional results, provisional results subject to appeals
and definitive results.)<br><br>And then after the elections, the march
on Monday November 10th took place in which supporters of Eduardo
Montealegre attacked people in the street in Managua. If one watched
events on the right wing Channel 2, one heard commentary from the news
presenters along the lines of "how dreadful that violence has returned
to our streets.... one can only hope the government will realize its
mistakes....." That was being said over footage of Montealegre's
supporters savagely beating Sandinista supporters.<br><br>That
back-to-front account of what was really happening was taken and
repeated immediately by national and international media. Various
prestigious media repeated the lie that the government did not permit
election observers. This falsehood appeared in "the Economist", "the
Independent" and on the BBC's on-line news site. Spain's "El País"
called for foreign intervention. "The New York Times" and "the
Guardian" did not repeat the worst of the lies, but nor did they report that
the violence was not&nbsp;provoked by the government.&nbsp;The opposition
began violent provocations on Monday the 10th, continued their
provocations all day Tuesday 11th and through part of Wednesday morning.
Government supporters responded to those provocations.<br><br>But on
the basis of that dishonest reporting of the facts,the opposition
managed to promote the image of an unstable country with a corrupt
government and institutions. The truth contradicts that version
completely. The country swiftly returned to normality despite all the
opposition provocations. The government continued its important
programmes in education, health care, agriculture, support for
businesses and social welfare, working in a markedly more efficient and
transparent way than previous governments ever did. That was the reason
its candidates at local level won so many municipalities in the
elections of November 9th.<br><br>It is normal for leaders of the
largest opposition party to dissemble the causes of their defeat in
Nicaragua's municipal elections. But Nicaragua's main opposition party
had a valuable accomplice in its defeat and its response to that
defeat.&nbsp; That accomplice was the Movimiento Renovador Sandinista
(MRS) party and its overseas allies - progressive ones as well as
reactionary ones.<br><br>After allying themselves with the main right
wing party - the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) - prior to the
elections, the MRS called on its sympathizers in Managua to vote for
the PLC's extreme right wing candidate in Managua, Eduardo Montealegre.
That in itself was extraordinary. More extraordinary yet is the fact
that they allied themselves with the very party that set in motion the
process that deprived the MRS of its legal status and about which MRS
leading light Dora Maria Tellez held a hunger strike in June this year.<br><br>Because
it was Wilfredo Navarro, the PLC's legal representative who complained
to the Supreme Electoral Council that the MRS was operating illegally.
After receiving that complaint, the CSE just applied the law as it
stood. At the time, the MRS accused the FSLN government of stripping
away its legal status as a political party. But it was not the
government that did so. The PLC did it. Even so, after the elections
Dora Maria Tellez appeared at public events with Eduardo Montealegre in
support of the PLC. The manoeuvre is glaringly clear. Everything was
set up months in advance so as to clear the way for an undivided
opposition vote so as to defeat the FSLN candidate in the capital
Managua.<br><br>Intellectuals and writers like Noam Chomsky, Eduardo
Galeano, Ariel Dorfman and Mario Benedetti among others publicly
supported Dora María Tellez during her hunger strike. Perhaps that
explains in part the silence of progressive media on the elections in
Nicaragua. They must surely feel used and foolish. It would be
reasonable to feel that way. With very few exceptions there has been
almost total silence in progressive media about the elections in
Nicaragua in November this year. The contrast with the coverage of the
elections in Venezuela is impressive.<br><br>There are not many things
to explain that silence. One has the rejection of the FSLN's
controversial decision to support a law penalizing therapeutic
abortion. There's the feeling against President Daniel Ortega caused by
accusations - which he and his family have always denied - of sexual
abuse, made by his step-daughter. There is the perception that part of
the FSLN leadership is too cosy with big business and the IMF. But
perhaps the decisive factor is the confusion caused by former FSLN
leaders who have abandoned that party and migrated to the Right.<br><br>Initially,
that migration was to&nbsp;positions of social democracy. That was the
line of Sergio Ramirez in 1994. Various people moved to join Ramirez,
little by little, very talented people with plenty of charm and
ability. Afterwards, when the FSLN won the 2006 presidential elections,
the chances of the MRS winning any significant presence in the National
Assembly diminished dramatically. In the National Assembly, the MRS
worked together with right wing parties not just in opposition to the
FSLN, but also collaborating, for example, in resolutions against the
Venezuelan government.<br><br>The confusion created by all these
factors is substantial. Apart from the case of the intellectuals and
writers who supported Dora Maria Tellez there is also the case of the
intellectuals who supported the poet Ernesto Cardenal in the absurd
case of a civil legal spat over a hotel and a US$1000 fine. Cardenal
and his mates manipulated the case in the same exaggerated, disingenuous
way used in all the other histrionic set pieces the MRS has used to
attack the FSLN government.<br><br>All these factors could explain the
silence on the elections in Nicaragua on the part of influential media
like, for example, ZNet in English or Rebelión in Spanish, where highly
regarded intellectuals, friendly with the MRS leadership, people like
Ignacio Ramonet or Noam Chomsky, are very influential. Perhaps that
explains why "Le Monde Diplomatique" of which Ramonet is the director,
recently published yet another repeat of Monica Baltodano's standard
turgid litany against the FSLN. Baltodano is one of those religiously
hypocritical opportunists straight out of Charles Baudelaire's
moral bestiary. Here one returns to the matter of the managerial classes and
their political dilemma.<br><br>The MRS represents a failed political
minority in Nicaragua. They allied with the right wing PLC party run by
Arnoldo Alemán, currently serving time - albeit very comfortable time
under notional house arrest - for corruption. Together with the PLC
they have mounted a false, fraudulent campaign alleging the municipal
elections of November were corrupt, that the government is a corrupt
dictatorship and that the country's institutions, like the Supreme
Electoral Council, are all corrupt as well.<br><br>The facts
demonstrate the contrary. There is no plausible evidence of significant
electoral fraud that might have changed the election results. The government
is implementing a successful and participatory programme in favour of
the impoverished majority. To defend their role as independent arbiters
of the electoral results of November 9th, the Supreme Electoral Council
magistrates have resisted huge anti-democratic pressure from the PLC
and its allies in the MRS.<br><br>The silence of many progressive
international media on the local elections in Nicaragua indicates the
dilemma of the progressive managerial classes. They are not immune to
infection by similar criteria to those propounded by James Burnham. In
Nicaragua, for the first time since the 1980s, a majority of people
voted for the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional. That is a truly
revolutionary achievement, a personal and political triumph for the
FSLN leaders and all its members. Almost without exception, the
international progressive media of opinion and analysis did not report
it.<br><br>Rather than show solidarity with the majority of people in
Nicaragua who voted for the FSLN, the managerial class that dominates
international progressive media decided to keep quiet. One of the most
influential of those media, "Le Monde Diplomatique", published an attack
on the FSLN by Monica Baltodano, someone who works with the right wing
in the National Assembly at the same time as she criticises the FSLN
for working with the right wing in the National Assembly. These
positions are not just infantile and pathetic. They are also
undemocratic.<br><br>In practice, the position of that progressive
managerial class validates the false accusations of fraud by the right
wing opposition in Nicaragua and their false denunciations of some kind
of dictatorship. De facto, their silence seconds the deceitful
reporting of the main corporate media. But they do not represent at all
what the majority of people in Nicaragua have demonstrated that they
think and want.<br><br>That indicates, at best, the arrogance of the
progressive managerial class that runs its sector of the global processes of
intellectual production and distribution. Nobody in Nicaragua is going
to consult "Le Monde Diplomatique" or any other similarly prestigious
media before seeking to benefit from a better education, better health
care, or vital credit they could never have accessed before. The
distance from arrogance to irrelevance is very short.<br><br>The MRS
leaders have&nbsp;demonstrated that the distance from irrelevance to
reaction is also very short. The international coverage of the
municipal elections in Nicaragua demonstrates that progressive media of
opinion and analysis can be just as resistant to reality as their
corporate counterparts, living in a virtual world according to personal
taste. Why read false, hypocritical attacks on the FSLN in "Le Monde
Diplomatique" when one can read the same kind of poison in "the
Economist"?<br><br></td>
