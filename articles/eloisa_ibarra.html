last month after working with the daily newspaper for ten years.
Publicly her former employers, Danilo Aguirre (director) and Fernando
Chamorro (owner / editor in chief), claim the reason behind her dismissal is that she was
not producing enough work. <br><br>Ibarra, however, believes her
employers based the decision on her refusal to abandon a position of
impartiality and approve the newspaper's active role within movements
fiercely opposed to the FSLN government. <br><br>Below is a summary of
Ibarra's statements about the events surrounding her dismissal and the
unjust treatment El Nuevo Diario journalists have been subjected to
during recent years. The following statements are taken from&nbsp;a
press conference Ibarra gave at the Nicaraguan&nbsp;College of
Journalists on March 3rd and an interview on Channel 4's "En Vivo"
program with journalist Alberto Mora on March 5th. <br><br>It is
important to note that the March 3rd press conference was not covered
by either of the daily newspapers (El Nuevo Diario and La Prensa, both
owned by the Chamorro family) or by Channel 2's TV Noticias (one of the
most popular TV news programs and the most fiercely anti FSLN program
on national TV).&nbsp; <br><br></span></small></big><div style="text-align: center;"><big style="color: black;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</big><br><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><small><span style="color: black;"></span></small></big></div><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><small><span style="color: black;"><br></span></small></big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Press Conference, Nicaraguan College of Journalists, March 3rd</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eloísa Ibarra:</span><br><br>I
want to tell you about my dismissal. On February 13th Doctor Danilo
Aguirre [founding director of El Nuevo Diario] called me into his
office and said that I was going to be fired ... and that he was giving me
the opportunity to resign first. <br><br>I said that if I was going to
be sacked I had the right to know why. So he said&nbsp;it was because the
newspaper was experiencing financial difficulties. I asked if he thought it was
right to sack someone who had given so much to the newspaper for that
reason. He responded that I would not be the only one, so&nbsp;I said,&nbsp;that may be the case but I am the first.<br><br>Then
he
said that was not the only reason - he said some of the other
journalists were not happy with my positions. So I asked which
journalists and which positions, because contrary to what he said I
know the
other journalists have great faith in me. [They have told me that] lots
of the issues I bring up in editorial meetings reflect their own take
on different
matters. <br><br>He did not know what more to say and finally said
that there were other reasons. "Like what?" I asked him. ... <br><br>"You know," he
said, "things are complicated with the government ...&nbsp;one is
obliged to take positions." <br><br>So then I said "now I am beginning to
understand." ... I said to him that I agree with the
newspaper criticizing the FSLN government when necessary ... but
that I am totally against the newspaper basing its coverage of events
on the experience and opinions of only one side and omitting the experience and opinions of the
other side. <br><br>"Nicaragua's problems are not just the
results of current government policy," I said, "they are due to political
problems, to problems within all the different political parties, they
are due to positions that certain businessmen hold, they are due to lots of
different things and not just to what the government does." <br style="color: black;">
<br style="color: black;">And I said to him that for the same reasons
[former president Arnoldo] Aleman had come to power, because even
though lots of [scandalous] things were known about him they were covered
up [by certain media outlets] in order to support him politically. And
now the same thing is happening with [former presidential candidate]
Eduardo Montealegre [implicated in the CENIS scandal along with 38
other former public officials].<br style="color: black;">
<br>I told him that I stand by the work I did in relation to the CENIS
scandal and that I would not change my position just
because [the newspaper's directors] want to cover up certain things about Montealegre and other people.  <br><br style="color: black;">Then
at the end I said to him, "you are also a journalist, and both of us
know why you are firing me." He didn't reply. ... "You aren't sacking me
because I am a lousy journalist, or for any other valid reason, but
because I insist on maintaining my positions of independence and
objectivity."<br><br>Our conversation finished there and the next day
they sacked me refering to article 45 of the Labour Code
- which is for when there is no just cause for dismissal. <br><br>Inside
El Nuevo Diario, because people were unhappy about my dismissal,
Francisco Chamorro called a meeting and said to the other journalists
that I had been sacked because I was not producing enough work. <br><br>The
reason I am here is precisely because I want to clarify this matter.
... If El Nuevo Diario had really been able to argue that my dismissal
was due to low levels of production, they would have applied article 48
of the Labour Code. ... But what they mean when they say&nbsp;low
production level&nbsp;is my failure to produce enough articles from the
point of view El Nuevo Diario has now adopted ... the point of view of
the opposition. <br><br>I am [giving this press conference] because
inside El Nuevo Diario, the journalists are suffering. The freedom of
expression the newspaper says should exist in the outside world is not
reflected within the editorial offices. The journalists are not told to write
articles in a certain way, but they understand that that is what is
expected of them. Because [if articles are not&nbsp;in line with the
director's political position] then they don't get published. <br><br>There
is an unwritten rule that nothing should be written about anything good
that the government does - that the government should be permanently
criticised. <br style="color: black;">
<br style="color: black;">I am here [giving this press conference]
because I think that it is time for us journalists to start to build
up&nbsp;the courage to speak out about what happens&nbsp; inside the
editorial
offices. We cannot go on keeping quiet. We cannot go on&nbsp;allowing
only the truths that they want to be heard to get out there.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</div><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><small><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Interview with Eloisa Ibarra on "Revista En Vivo con Alberto Mora," Channel 4, March 5th</span><br><br>Alberto
Mora: Are you dissapointed [about your dismissal]? ... I want to be
honest, I am not surprised, are you? Do you feel hurt?<br><br>Eloisa
Ibarra: I am not surprised because I saw it coming. Now I am making
public everything I said inside El Nuevo Diario, for example, about
Danilo Aguirre having involved himself with the opposition group.<br><br>AM: They asked you not you have political loyalties, right? <br><br>EI:
During the electoral campaign [leading up to the municipal elections
last November] they called all the journalists to a meeting and said
that we should not bring out political loyalties with us to work. I said
that I agreed with the policy, but that they shouldn't ask that of us
if just a couple of hours beforehand Danilo Aguirre had appeared in a
press conference as a member of a group which defines itself as
a government opponent. ...&nbsp; <br><br>During my time at El Nuevo
Diario I didn't keep my criteria quiet. Everything that I am now saying
in public, I would say it constantly, daily, at meetings. I even had
the courage to question Danilo Aguirre in a meeting with the entire
editorial team. <br><br>After that meeting someone said to me "Eloisa,
Aguirre will never forgive you for that." Just like in the past people
said to me that the Chamorros would never forgive me for including
Jaime Chamorro's name in my investigation about the CENIS scandal. ...<br><br>AM:
So you would have had to have a clear confrontative position, let's
say, against the government in order to preserve your job? Is that the
logic of employment within the newspaper?<br><br>EI: Yes, that's right.
And that is why I have insisted that us journalists have to overcome
our fear, we cannot go on allowing ourselves to be hijacked by the
owners of big media. They cannot oblige us to go on telling lies in
order to keep&nbsp;our jobs.<br><br>I think that right now it is more
necessary than ever that the media acts responsably. Considering the
situation in Nicaragua at the moment, for the good of the country, we
cannot go on inventing, creating situations just because of some
political or economic interest.<br><br>AM: You mentioned the word lie. What are you refering to?<br><br>EI:
For example, how can one permit a headline when the government
intervened in Tropigas saying "They confiscated Tropigas"? They know
perfectly well that it wasn't a confiscation, it was an intervention.
Doctor Danilo Aguirre is a lawyer and knows what a confiscation is and
what an intervention is. Deep down they knew perfectly well that [what
the government did] benefitted ordinary people. ...<br><br>AM:
It is an unscrupulous thing to do. It also reflects an attitude of
hate, ... there is terrible personal personal hatred there. I don't
understand it. <br><br>EI:
There is personal hatred and there are economic interests that are far
too big. ... El Nuevo Diario was treated very well by the previous government.
During the Bolaños Administration La Prensa, El Nuevo Diario and
Channel 2 passed all the [government's] publicity. The journalists
could not say much [against the government] precisely because of that,
because there would be too much to lose. That is what is that the
bottom of all this. ...<br><br>AM: [At El Nuevo Diario] do they edit journalists' reports much? <br><br>EI:
They change bits around, they add bits. My report from the day the
accusations in the CENIS case were presented was changed, bits were
added. I complained about it. I wasn't going to allow them to do
that with my piece, they didn't even change my name. <br><br>I think
that if the government is doing something wrong, a serious, responsible
media outlet should point it out but not in a hateful manner, not with
an underlying political intention, it should be pointed out in a report based on
responsibly reported truths. I think that it is actually useful for the
government when things are reported in an objective way because
then they can correct things.<br><br>AM: Information is sacrificed for political interests, Eloísa?<br><br>EI:
That is what is happening, and I think this is the moment for
journalists, and not just El Nuevo Diario journalists, but journalists
from all the different media outlets, to start ... valuing ourselves
more and demanding respect. [We must demand] an end to the violation of
our rights - because the most important right a journalist has is to
tell the truth, to write about events as they happened and not to lie
to readers. <br><br>A week before my dismissal Francisco Chamorro
stooped really low - he censured an opinion piece of mine in which I
was discussing how media companies, and especially TV media companies,
are sacking journalists in order to take on models or students in first
or second year at university who don't know anything [about
journalism]. ...<br><br>AM: All this talk about censureship. They talk
a lot about government censureship, but this media dictatorship carries
out vicious censureship of [government programs]. ... Like you said,
they'll say "we're not interested in this," but maybe that story is
something positive for ordinary people. ...<br><br>EI: [The bosses at
El Nuevo Diario] defend the right of micro credit outfits to
competetive conditions, something they say is affected by the
government's Usury Zero program. Several times I said to Francisco
Chamorro at meetings;<br><br>"Francisco, this program may not benefit
us, but it does benefit a whole lot of poor people. You know that they
hardly pay any interest, and for someone really poor to receive 5,000
córdobas is a big help - for you and I perhaps it wouldn't be
significant, but for poor people it is." <br><br>So then he said to me
that the government only selected&nbsp;FSLN supporters to be benefitted
with the program. And so I said that I know people, people close to me,
who do not support the FSLN, and they received Usury Zero - no one
asked them if they supported the government or not. So [what El Nuevo
Diario says about this matter] is false - they shouldn't be allowed [to
publish] that. ... <br><br>I totally agree that the press should
criticize the government when necessary,&nbsp; but not in this way,
covering up good things and magnifying bad things. <br><br>AM: Let's
talk a bit about the [electoral] campaign [during the run up to the
municipal elections of last November]. In the campaign El Nuevo Diario
had a position - they supported their candidate like other media
outlets do. <br><br>EI: The campaign was terrible. Once at a meeting
just a couple of weeks before the elections I asked Francisco ... if we
were going to do some kind of report&nbsp;taking stock of the campaign
as a whole so that people see that El Nuevo Diario is imparcial.<br><br>So he said "have you got a problem [with the newspaper's coverage so far]?" <br><br>"Of course," I said, "up until now we have only covered one side's campaign." <br><br>So he said "we don't cover the FSLN because they deny us information, they don't invite us." <br><br>"But
Alexis and Daysi are out there campaigning on the street," I said, "we
don't need them to invite us. We follow Montealegre around wherever he
goes." ...<br><br>I remember that when we were asked not to bring our
political loyalties into the office a colleague said to me "I feel like
the only loyalties they want us to leave outside are FSLN loyalties,
because I see other party loyalties inside the office." They've got
that journalist on their black list. <br><br>They used to say that
certain journalists were moles, that we were passing information to the
FSLN. It was like being in a mad house, definitely, the persecution was
madness, just because we had our positions, because we thought
independently. ...<br><br>AM: What about social security, labour
rights, is there much abuse in that regard, Eloísa? Yesterday [when I
heard you talking about this subject] I was shocked ... when you said
that workers didn't have the right to get their dinner paid for unless
they were working after 10 pm.<br><br>EI: Who eats at that time?! Can
you imagine, the poor drivers at midday, sitting in the van in some
parking lot - they aren't given expenses to buy lunch. </span></small></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><small><span style="color: black;">It
is especially wrong to apply this policy to drivers, who earn so
little. ... When journalists or photographers travel outside Managua
they aren't given expenses beforehand.<br><br>Then there is the case of
one poor photographer whose lense was broken in a rally. Who do you
think paid for it? The photographer. ... <br><br>AM: What about overtime? ... <br><br>EI:
El Nuevo Diario doesn't pay overtime. Workers have to work overtime but
it isn't compensated. ... For example, when we were covering the trial
against Aleman which lasted two months, sometimes I worked from seven
in the morning until midnight, but I wasn't paid any hours of overtime.
<br><br>This is why in El Nuevo Diario we wanted to form a workers
union - we wanted to introduce a system where workers mark cards when
they arrive and leave work and for any time over and above the normal
working timetable to be paid as overtime. <br><br>El Nuevo Diario&nbsp;and the other media outlets need unions so that all of these things can be clarified. </span></small></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><small><span style="color: black;">For the good of the journalists, and above all for the good of the country, t</span></small></big><big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><small><span style="color: black;">he situation can't go on like this. <br>  </span></small></big><br>We
cannot permit a situation where journalists are hijacked, are forced to
respond to the interests of media company owners. Journalists depend on
their salaries, they have to look after their jobs.... <br><br>I
insist, it is time for media company owners to rethink their strategy,
for the good of the country, because they are doing Nicaragua so much
damage. They are leading the country and the people towards a dangerous
uncertainty, towards confrontation.&nbsp; <big style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><small><span style="color: black;"></span></small></big>
