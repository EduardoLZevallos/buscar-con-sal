      <br>
When the FSLN government came to power in 2007 it began implementing a
foreign policy which could be considered the antithesis of the one
employed by Enrique Bola&ntilde;os&#8217; administration before it. In doing
so, Nicaragua has been successful in demonstrating that the previous
arrangement of almost exclusive dependence on the US and European Union
Aid-Trade-Debt model is most certainly not in the nation&#8217;s interests. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua&#8217;s successful diversification of trade and cooperation
partnerships and the resulting opportunities for the nation&#8217;s people
and economic sectors quickly became an example for the region, and for
the world; an example Western Bloc governments have been desperate to
conceal and undermine. Two and a half years later, however, and despite
US and European attempts to the contrary, Nicaragua&#8217;s pragmatic and
bold foreign policy continues to provide benefits which would have been
unthinkable if the Washington inspired, neoliberal status quo had
remained intact. <br>
      <br>
By far the most important foreign policy decision taken by the FSLN
government was the country&#8217;s incorporation into the Bolivarian
Alternative - now renamed the Bolivarian Alliance - for the People of
the Americas, ALBA, and its little sister, the regional energy
integration initiative, Petrocaribe.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua&#8217;s membership of these two regional initiatives, founded by
the Venezuelan and Cuban governments and based on an ideology of
solidarity, complementarity and fair trade, has permitted the FSLN
government to overcome the catastrophic energy crisis that had brought
the national economy to its knees by late 2006, and freed up hundreds
of millions of dollars for desperately needed social and infrastructure
projects. <br>
      <br>
Also thanks to ALBA, Nicaragua has found a secure market for its
surplus food production in Venezuela. Nicaraguan exports to Venezuela
increased from US$6.3 million in 2007 to US$32.7 million in 2008.
During the first semester of 2009 exports to the South American country
were worth US$45.4 million superseding the figure for all of 2008. <br>
      <br>
The main products Nicaragua exports to Venezuela are cattle, beef,
basic grains and dairy products. The Venezuelan market has been a
lifesaver for the agriculture sector at a time when other markets
(specifically the US and Central American markets) have significantly
reduced purchases of Nicaraguan produce. <br>
      <br>
Promoting regional integration closer to home<br>
      <br>
In line with Nicaragua&#8217;s general foreign policy objective of
strengthening regional unity and cooperation, the FSLN government has
played an important role in promoting Central American integration.
This has been achieved mainly through Nicaragua&#8217;s participation in
SICA, the Central American Integration System.<br>
      <br>
Between January and June of 2009 the FSLN government held the pro
tempore presidency of SICA during which time it took full advantage of
the opportunity to promote its philosophy of regional solutions for
regional problems. Numerous presidential and ministerial meetings were
hosted in Nicaragua on subject matters as diverse as food security,
social housing, environmental protection and sustainable rural
development with Nicaragua&#8217;s recent experiences of projects in these
areas put forward as a model for other Central American countries. <br>
      <br>
President Daniel Ortega&#8217;s six-month presidency also oversaw the
unification of regional positions regarding the inclusion of a Common
Credit Fund as part of Central America&#8217;s Association Agreement with the
European Union. As a result, the EU eventually agreed to the creation
of this multi million-dollar credit fund, financed mainly with European
money, which will serve as a source of funding Central American
governments can tap into for social, infrastructure and other projects.
      <br>
&nbsp;<br>
While staunchly defending ALBA and Petrocaribe at regional and other
forums, Nicaragua has also managed to strengthen trade and cooperation
links with important regional players, Mexico and Brazil, whose
governments have demonstrated varying degrees of opposition to the
regional integration initiatives. <br>
      <br>
In June 2007 Ortega and Mexican President Felipe Calderon signed an
important bilateral agreement as part of which greater political,
commercial and cultural exchange and cooperation between the two
countries was established. As part of this agreement Calderon committed
to providing funds for the construction of three stretches of highway
in Nicaragua and the purchase of 350 new buses for public transport. <br>
      <br>
In terms of bilateral relations with Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva made an official visit to Nicaragua in August 2007 during
which an agreement to strengthen relations in all fields between the
two countries was signed by the Nicaraguan and Brazilian foreign
ministers. The agreement included Brazil&#8217;s commitment to finance
development projects in Nicaragua in the areas of education, health,
energy, agriculture, forestry, external relations, tourism and
investment. <br>
      <br>
As a result of the general rapprochement between the two countries,
earlier this year a Brazilian company was awarded a contract to
construct a major hydro-electric generation plant in the central zone
of Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua establishes close relations with extra-regional governments<br>
      <br>
In terms of extra-regional relations, the government has managed to
secure new cooperation agreements with Russia and Iran as well as
fomenting private commercial links with The People&#8217;s Republic of China
while maintaining the longstanding cooperation agreement with the
Taiwanese government.<br>
      <br>
During a three-day official visit to Russia in December 2008 President
Daniel Ortega and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev laid the
foundations for major projects funded by Russia to be carried out in
Nicaragua. The main areas of cooperation with Russia include healthcare
(Russia is providing funding to update technological equipment in
Nicaraguan public hospitals), energy (Russian companies plan to
construct hydro electric plants capable of generating 400 megawatts of
electricity), telecommunications (Russia will facilitate the
development of fourth generation communications in Nicaragua as well as
permitting Nicaraguan use of the Russian global system of navigation
with the GLONASS satellite global positioning system) and public
transport (Russia has committed to facilitating hundreds of new
vehicles for Nicaragua&#8217;s public transport system).<br>
      <br>
Recently further cooperation agreements between the two countries were
signed including a military cooperation agreement that will permit the
Nicaraguan Army to declare the country free of landmines by the end of
2010. <br>
      <br>
Earlier this year the newly established trade links with Russia were
proven to be an indispensable factor of the FSLN government&#8217;s
diversification of trade partners. In January and February, as seafood
exports to the US fell dramatically, the Nicaraguan seafood industry
found itself on the verge of collapse. In April, however, a Russian
government delegation visited the country to sign a major commercial
agreement permitting Nicaraguan seafood exports to Russia.<br>
      <br>
It is not surprising that Russia is keen to establish broad cooperation
links with Nicaragua given the historical geo-political importance the
small Central American nation has held in terms of Russia&#8217;s wider
foreign policy objectives. Additionally, Nicaragua&#8217;s prompt recognition
of Abkhasia and South Ossetia as sovereign states after the Russian
military succeeded in ousting Georgian troops from the two territories
in 2008 has helped to encourage Russian cooperation with Nicaragua.
Venezuela folllowed Nicaraguaps lead when it too recognized South
Ossetia and Abkhasia&nbsp;&nbsp; during a visit early in September this
year by President Hugo Chavez Frias.<br>
      <br>
Another new ally as part of the Nicaraguan government&#8217;s pro South-South
integration foreign policy is the Iranian government led by Mahmud
Ahmadinejad. As part of the agreements resulting from the recently
established bilateral relations with Iran, the construction of a number
of health centers in marginalized neighbourhoods has been financed and
a US$234 million loan for the construction of a major hydro-electric
generation plant was awarded by the Iranian Development
Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Additionally the FSLN government has facilitated commercial links with
companies from Vietnam and from the People&#8217;s Republic of China. Earlier
this year the Vietnamese State petroleum company PetroVietnam signed an
energy cooperation agreement with Nicaraguan state oil company,
Petronic, to carry out joint hydrocarbons exploration studies off
Nicaragua&#8217;s Pacific and Caribbean coasts.<br>
      <br>
Meanwhile the recently established Nicaraguan-Chinese Chamber of
Industry and Commerce organized the First Chinese Commercial Exhibition
in Nicaragua, which took place in late August. During the event
Nicaraguan producers of tobacco, dried fruits, organic coffee, rum and
handicrafts were able to make direct contact with Chinese companies
keen to import their products. Currently plans are being made for a
Nicaraguan delegation to participate in a major commercial exhibition
in Shanghai in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
US and Europe&#8217;s unease begins to show<br>
      <br>
In its 2009 institutional plan the Nicaraguan Ministry of External
Relations describes its strategic objectives as, among others, to
strengthen bilateral relations and fraternal links with the people and
governments of the world, to permanently defend Nicaraguan sovereignty
and to coordinate relations with governments and multilateral
organizations that provide cooperation funds ensuring that the use of
these funds is in line with the FSLN government&#8217;s national priorities. <br>
      <br>
The array of new commercial and economic cooperation opportunities
listed above demonstrates the success of the Foreign Ministry&#8217;s
expressed objective of strengthening links with other countries around
the world. <br>
      <br>
The fact that the US and European governments have begun to make it
more difficult for Nicaragua to access aid and development money could
be considered as evidence that the Foreign Ministry has succeeded in
the latter two objectives - to defend Nicaraguan sovereignty and to
insist on a say in the designation and use of aid money coming into the
country.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
In December 2008 the Budget Support Group, made up of different
European governments, announced its decision to withhold a little more
than US$40 million of budget support money. The reason given for the
decision was the political opposition&#8217;s allegations that the municipal
election process, which took place the previous month, was fraudulent. <br>
      <br>
This same false excuse was put forward as justification by the
Directorate Board of the US government&#8217;s Millennium Challenge
Corporation for its decision to bring to an end to its operations in
Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>
Both the European and North American governments dragged out the aid
decision making process for as long as possible thus maximizing the
number of opportunities for the corporate media to cover officials
calling on the government, in the best traditionsof hypocritical neo
colonialism, to respect &#8220;internationally accepted democratic norms,&#8221;
without ever defining exactly what that amorphous phrase may in fact
mean, or how it might apply to Nicaragua.<br>
      <br>
It took the Millennium Challenge Corporation&#8217;s Directors six months to
make up their minds whether the government had, from their neocolonial
poitn of view, cleaned up its act. The European&#8217;s are still unsure.
Recently the European Commission&#8217;s foreign affairs representative,
Steffani Sannino, was in Nicaragua and announced the disbursement of
US$10 million of the suspended aid money, pending a final decision
about the designation of the aid, probablky for Nicaragua's education
system. <br>
      <br>
The vague and unconvincing argument that concern for the state of
democracy in Nicaragua is behind the US and Europe&#8217;s decision to reduce
aid is considered merely a front by the FSLN government. For the people
who are constructing the road to Latin America&#8217;s second independence,
the importance of Nicaragua&#8217;s role in that process is obvious. It is
natural, therefore, that Western Bloc governments should begin to feel
uneasy about any loosening of their chokehold on Nicaragua&#8217;s economy
and its foreign policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The bottom line of all this is the historically demonstrated fact that
Western governments are not well disposed to aid-recipient governments
that take the initiative to construct a future for their nation other
than the one the Western Bloc already has mapped out for them. <br>
      <br>
Given the current international economic situation, and more
specifically the state of the US and European economies, the FSLN
government&#8217;s decision, back in 2007, to diversify its commercial and
other external relations, has been shown to be wise. It is almost
impossible to imagine the extent of the crisis the country would
currently be submerged in if the FSLN had not acted swiftly during its
first months in office. <br>
      <br>
Nicaragua&#8217;s victories have not come easily, however. Right now Honduras
is paying the price for its decision to try tentatively to follow in
the footsteps of its southern neighbour. It remains to be seen how much
further the Western Bloc is willing to go, or indeed able to, given its
current economic debacle, to crush Nicaragua&#8217;s good example.<br>
