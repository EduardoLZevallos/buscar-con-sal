            <br>
            Journalism has been rendered obsolete by the reporting
            practice of media in NATO countries and their allies.&nbsp;
            Recent wars from the Ivory Coast to Libya&nbsp; and now
            Syria only confirm what was already clear after the chain of
            wars in the 1990s, in former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Somalia,
            Rwanda, the Congo and many other places. NATO country
            information media across the political spectrum are, one way
            or another, a vital component of NATO war planning and
            practice in terms of psy-warfare. The same is also true of
            the aid, development and human rights non-governmental
            sector of those NATO countries.<br>
            <br>
            The conflicts in Libya and Syria demonstrated that most
            progressive and radical currents of political opinion will
            readily collaborate with NATO psy-warfare campaigns against
            target countries. In general almost all progressive opinion
            is intimidated by the completely bogus rhetoric of human
            rights and democracy deployed by the NATO country
            psy-warfare machinery. The most common expression of this is
            for the representatives of progressive opinion to try and
            seek a neutral position that in practice facilitates NATO
            aggression against its target countries.<br>
            <br>
            Latin America<br>
            <br>
            This in turn means that even political systems and movements
            enjoying mass support can be readily demonized as has
            happened in the cases of the Libyan Jamahiriya or of the
            Syrian Ba'ath party. Similar tactics are being used today
            against all countries in Latin America that do not conform
            to the desires of NATO country governments, and against
            solidarity both between those countries and towards them.
            The focus shifts from one nation to another, depending on
            the specific conjuncture. Apart from the constant campaign
            against Venezuela, one can think of the so-called Cuban
            &#8220;Black Spring&#8221; in 2003, the weeks and months prior to the
            failed coup against Correa in Ecuador in 2010, or today&#8217;s
            protests against Evo Morales in Bolivia or those against
            Cristina Fernandez in Argentina and now the coup attempt in
            Paraguay against Fernando Lugo.<br>
            <br>
            These demonization campaigns always imply some element of
            differentiation among the Latin American rebels. Whereas
            sometimes the CNN and other imperial outlets focus on Lula&#8217;s
            or Dilma Roussef's &#8220;realism&#8221; vis-&aacute;-vis Ch&aacute;vez&#8217;
            &#8220;unpredictability&#8221;, other times they may choose to underline
            Correa&#8217;s willingness to talk with, say, Hilary Clinton
            against Daniel Ortega&#8217;s &#8220;shrewdness&#8221; and so on. The roles of
            angels and foes can change overnight an, of course, have
            nothing to do with reality but with the needs and logic of
            information psy-warfare.<br>
            <br>
            As a chorus to the corporate media&#8217;s demonizing cacophony, a
            parallel world of debates is carried out in the so-called
            alternative media &#8211; a diverse universe in which Western
            voices nevertheless wield disproportionate influence in
            terms of their actual political relevance. These voices,
            often very influential in the circles of Western progressive
            opinion, hand out tiny revolutionary stars of legitimacy to
            movements or processes. The stars are awarded according to
            various criteria - democratic credentials, treatment of
            various minorities, ecological footprint, economic policy
            and so on.<br>
            <br>
            This supposedly alternative arena complements mainstream
            Western corporate media psy-warfare against NATO's target
            countries by reinforcing differences and sharpening
            contradictions.&nbsp; As in the corporate media, little or
            no attention is paid to the real situation or to debates of
            the subjects and political instruments that are building and
            shaping processes and movements for change. The final result
            is very functional to the aims of NATO&#8217;s planners: division,
            isolation of the targets, confusion among those who could
            organize an effective resistance to imperialism and,
            finally, paralysis in facing the interventions.<br>
            <br>
            The &#8220;neither (&#8230;) nor (&#8230;) syndrome&#8221;, formerly known as the
            &#8220;two daemons&#8217; syndrome&#8221;, historically has yielded
            catastrophic results in fighting imperialism. It is only a
            question of time before these campaigns of psychological
            warfare against the region intensify at unprecedented levels
            as the voice of Latin America&#8217;s most radical democracies,
            especially that of the ALBA countries, becomes more
            prominent in the creation of a new multipolar world order,
            as well as in the practical achievement of social models
            that transcend capitalism in the real world. A recent
            article in Le Monde Diplomatique,&nbsp; flagship monthly of
            Western progressive elites, suggests that the psywarfare
            machinery is being greased up and shifted into higher gear
            against Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            The structure and content of the article, &#8220;Why Nicaragua
            chose Ortega?&#8221;, by Maurice Lemoine, published in the June
            2012 edition of Le Monde Diplomatique, show how readily
            NATO's psy-warfare strategy can co-opt ostensibly
            progressive media. It is worth looking at the nuts and bolts
            of the machinery to see how it works. The parallels with the
            current psy-warfare campaign against Syria offer little
            comfort for those who believe the US and its allies will
            find it harder to co-opt the neocolonial Left to attack
            Latin America than targets like Syria.<br>
            <br>
            Context<br>
            <br>
            Before looking closely at Lemoine's exercise in
            disinformation, it may be helpful to consider the immediate
            context with regard to the continuing aggression against
            Syria by the terrorist NATO governments and their regional
            allies. As in the case of Libya, most liberal and
            progressive opinion refuses to express solidarity with the
            Syrian government. The suggestion is that, as in the case of
            Libya in 2011, there is some kind of third position,
            distinct both from that of NATO's genocidal governments and
            from that of the Syrian government.<br>
            <br>
            Lebanese writer Amal Saad Ghorayeb has written acutely in
            Al-Akhbar on that phenomenon and for her pains experienced a
            predictable wave of indignant responses from people across
            the progressive end of the political spectrum. The tenets
            upheld as indisputable by Ghorayeb's critics are that Syria
            is a uniquely evil government and that the rebellion against
            it is legitimated by overwhelming popular support. But
            neither of those assertions are in the least true.<br>
            <br>
            Syria's human rights record is better than that of Israel,
            Turkey or Saudi Arabia or any of the feudal monarchies that
            comprise the Gulf States. The Syrian government's response
            to the armed insurgency against it has been demonstrably
            more restrained than the practice of the US, France and
            Britain or their allies Israel and Turkey, for example,
            anywhere those countries have been faced with armed
            rebellion. Furthermore, the Syrian government clearly enjoys
            majority support across the greater part of its territory. <br>
            <br>
            What is remarkable for people in Nicaragua are the striking
            parallels between the kind of arguments used in the case of
            Syria and those deployed to smear and denigrate&nbsp; the
            Sandinista government in Nicaragua. More remarkable still
            are the completely unselfcritical terms in which those
            arguments are made. The usual keywords are constant:
            &#8220;democracy&#8221; &#8220;democratic institutions&#8221; &#8220;human rights&#8221;
            &#8220;freedom of expression&#8221;.<br>
            <br>
            The underlying assumption is invariably that people in the
            US and Europe understand and enjoy democracy, human rights
            and freedom of expression while people in countries like
            Syria and Nicaragua do not. The arguments deliberately deny
            or obscure the fact that majorities in both those countries
            support their governments. In the case of Syria, that
            support has held fast against vicious NATO-supported
            terrorist onslaught, and in the case of Nicaragua, against
            constant slander and economic intimidation, the latest
            instance being the cutting of US government development
            cooperation.<br>
            <br>
            The human rights records of the US and Europe with regard to
            immigrants and ethnic minorities are universally abysmal.
            The record of severe human rights abuses by the UK in
            Ireland or by Spain in the Basque country hardly needs
            rehearsing yet again. The appalling domestic human rights
            record of the US government&nbsp; has few rivals running the
            whole gamut from political prisoners and routine
            administrative disappearance of illegal immigrants via
            regular police and prison brutality to the routine use of
            torture, inhumane and degrading treatment and other blatant
            and complete abandonment of international judicial norms.<br>
            <br>
            Apart from their complacency about their own countries'
            human rights records, self-righteous NATO-country critics of
            target countries like Syria and Nicaragua are completely
            silent about the most massive anti-democratic transfer of
            wealth in history that has taken place in the United States
            and Europe. Trillions of dollars have been shifted from
            those countries' majorities to support the NATO country
            plutocrat corporate and financial oligarchies. A fraction of
            those amounts would suffice to eradicate hunger worldwide.
            Yet still we are expected to believe in the benign
            &#8220;humanism&#8221; of the West.<br>
            <br>
            The ruling elites that control NATO country economies ensure
            their populations are constantly intimidated by threats and
            fear-mongering against concerted resistance to the area's
            completely corrupt financial system. Furthermore, the
            reality of human rights and democracy in the NATO countries
            is little different to that anywhere else in the world,
            elite cronyism, corruption and impunity for the powerful are
            the norm. Outlets of progressive opinion in those countries
            for the most part completely fail to compare and contrast
            that undeniable reality with the reality in countries like
            Syria and Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            On almost all foreign affairs issues, both corporate and
            alternative Western media tend to string along with fake
            reality created by corporate psy-warfare media. The Houla
            massacre in Syria is the latest and clearest example. Across
            the political spectrum facts are distorted and rumours
            exaggerated precisely because any true and fair account of
            the facts would render absolutely ridiculous the alleged
            pretexts for targeting potential NATO victim-countries.<br>
            <br>
            That is the overall context in which Le Monde Diplomatique
            has published Maurice Lemoine's dishonest account of the
            current situation in Nicaragua and its recent history. In
            effect, that context renders supposedly progressive outlets
            like Le Monde Diplomatique little more than post-modern echo
            chambers for NATO's insane neoconservative globalization
            project. Consciously or unconsciously, they continue to
            believe in the West's non-existent moral superiority. In
            doing so, they reinforce the psy-warfare component of NATO's
            ruthless war on humanity.<br>
            <br>
            Nicaragua<br>
            <br>
            Lemoine's article is a classic exercise in neo-colonial Left
            disinformation. The article's disingenuous, tendentious
            content and its egregious omissions follow the standard
            format of NATO country media psy-warfare against governments
            that obstruct Western geostrategic interests. For Le Monde
            Diplomatique this is nothing new. Few people familiar with
            the reality of NATO target countries like Nicaragua could
            reasonably&nbsp; regard Le Monde Diplomatique as a
            trustworthy source of reliable information on international
            affairs.<br>
            <br>
            The arguments in this Le Monde Diplomatique article rehash
            yet again the discredited anti-Sandinista propaganda of
            Nicaragua's political opposition, emphatically aligned with
            the imperialist policies of the governments of Canada, the
            United States and the European Union. Lemoine and his
            editors try to save Le Monde Diplomatique's progressive
            credentials by citing ex-Sandinistas in the misnamed
            Sandinista Renewal Movement (MRS) from the NATO-aligned
            Nicaraguan opposition. Among the article's most dishonest
            gambits, it quotes those individuals while failing to
            mention that they and their organizations have been directly
            funded by Western governments or by those governments' proxy
            non-governmental organizations.<br>
            <br>
            Lemoine's article begins with two outright lies in a single
            sentence : President Daniel Ortega's &#8220;Sandinista government
            has abandoned many of its principles, especially on women's
            rights, to stay in power.&#8221; But the historic programme of the
            Frente Sandinista&nbsp; has always been based on political
            pluralism, international non-alignment and a mixed economy.
            That was true in the 1980s and it remains true now. Those
            unchanging principles have been thoroughly vindicated by the
            practice of Daniel Ortega and his colleagues since the
            FSLN's return to government in January 2007.<br>
            <br>
            Maurice Lemoine and his editors have merely recycled a
            hostile gloss from ex-Sandinista sources who themselves long
            ago abandoned the most minimal vestige of anti-imperialism,
            a fundamental Sandinista tenet. Le Monde Diplomatique cites
            people who have profoundly betrayed their own Sandinista
            past to try and smear Nicaragua's FSLN government as
            unprincipled. The article then compounds&nbsp; that
            self-evident dishonesty with the absurd claim that the FSLN
            government has abandoned its support for women's rights in
            Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            The reverse is self-evidently true, since the position of
            women has changed radically for the better in Nicaragua
            since January 2007. Nicaragua is now among the leading
            countries in the world in the number of its women
            legislators and in women's representation in senior
            government posts. The FSLN government's social programmes
            deliberately&nbsp; prioritize hundreds of thousands of
            previously economically excluded women and have brought them
            into active economic participation. In April 2012, the FSLN
            sponsored the passage of a law ensuring that 50% of
            candidates in all national and local elections must be
            women.<br>

            In June 2012 another FSLN sponsored law, passed in April
            2012, came into effect, criminalizing a wide range of
            misogynist behaviour, making femicide a crime distinct from
            homicide and mandating a national campaign against violence
            against women. Despite this unprecedented range of policies
            and legislation in favour of women, Lemoine's article
            supinely retails standard NATO psy-warfare anti-FSLN
            untruths in their liberal/social democrat variety.<br>
            <br>
            Similarly, Lemoine gives a pro-MRS summary of the vicious
            power struggle within the FSLN in the years after the 1990
            election. He omits the ruthless cynicism with which Sergio
            Ramirez and his partners tried to railroad Sandinista rank
            and file into accepting a social democrat coup in the party.
            Nor does the article mention the disgraceful role played by
            Ramirez's colleague Rosa Marina Zelaya as president of the
            Supreme Electoral Council in the blatantly rigged elections
            of 1996.<br>
            <br>
            Lemoine couples these kinds of omissions with the use of
            contemptuous descriptions in relation to the FSLN to soften
            up his readers' receptivity to his version of events. Thus,
            Lemoine talks about an Ortega &#8220;clique&#8221;. He repeats
            opposition accusations against Daniel Ortega and the
            FSLN&nbsp; making no attempt to appraise them. The
            accusations are left unanswered, but the reader is then
            immediately confronted with &#8220;This (widespread) view of
            events suggests the FSLN had lost its way.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            Certainly, Lemoine is correct to note these untruths are
            widespread, precisely among the liberal and social democrat
            intellectual-managerial classes of the NATO countries - the
            natural audience, in fact, of Le Monde Diplomatique. Here we
            are dealing with the infinite disinformation feedback loop
            that is NATO's fundamental propaganda mechanism. A small,
            unrepresentative opposition in a NATO target country emits
            venomous falsehoods against its government. NATO country
            psy-warfare media recycle the untruths. Those lies&nbsp;
            then become &#8220;widespread&#8221; orthodoxy fed back to their point
            of origin in an effort to broaden local opposition support.<br>
            <br>
            In that strategic context, Lemoine's article also follows
            standard NATO psy-warfare media tactics in deploying its
            text. Firstly, the article frames the context of the
            readers' approach to its content in terms that implicitly
            deprecate the moral calibre of the&nbsp; FSLN government in
            Nicaragua, at the same time severely criticizing its
            concrete policies. Secondly, the rest of the article offers
            occasional mild qualifications of the extremely negative
            image created so as to give a false impression of &#8220;balance&#8221;.<br>
            <br>
            So in the first half of his article, Lemoine uncritically
            quotes opposition figures and offers a very crude summary of
            the huge political challenge facing the FSLN through the
            late 1990s and early 2000s. He dismisses the FSLN's profound
            efforts at overcoming the deep hostility and division
            inherited from the war of the 1980s as playing &#8220;the
            reconciliation game&#8221;. He picks quotes from Orlando
            Nu&ntilde;ez Soto to make it sound as if the FSLN
            acknowledges that in some sense it needs to apologize for
            its policy of alliances prior to the 2001 and 2006
            elections, something which is quite untrue.<br>
            <br>
            Implicit, but concealed, in Lemoine's text is the fact that
            the direct consequence of the FSLN's policy of alliances
            from 1998 to the present has been the apparently irreparable
            break up of the right-wing that had dominated Nicaraguan
            politics from 1990 to 2006. That result vindicates the deep
            and sharp political acumen of an FSLN leadership composed of
            different currents not by any means always in harmonious
            agreement. It renders a complete non sequitur Lemoine's
            observation that the FSLN lost sympathy among the Western
            Left, none of whom vote in Nicaragua.<br>
            <br>
            This last point is highly relevant in relation to the issue
            of abortion in Nicaragua which was completely banned in
            October 2006 just weeks prior to the national elections of
            that year won by Daniel Ortega. Lemoine attempts to put the
            issue in context but neglects to note that for the vast
            majority of women in Nicaragua, abortion rights are not a
            priority. Nor does Lemoine note that maternal mortality has
            dropped significantly since the FSLN took office in January
            2007. Only the most bitter of the FSLN government's enemies
            reject the clear drop in maternal mortality apparent in
            government statistics, currently down to around 70 deaths
            per 100,000 births.<br>
            <br>
            Lemoine quotes Sergio Ramirez saying &#8220;The rank-and-file
            Sandinistas did not abandon their leader, though following
            him called for courage.&#8221; This self-serving nonsense gives
            the impression that some large number of FSLN supporters
            went along with Ramirez and his fellow social democrat
            opportunists. They never did. The overwhelming majority of
            FSLN supporters have always rallied to Daniel Ortega because
            he is Nicaragua's only political leader who truly represents
            the interests of Nicaragua's impoverished majority.<br>
            <br>
            Another example of Lemoine's cynical deployment of
            unanswered accusations displays the blatant misogynist
            hatred of the Nicaraguan opposition for Daniel Ortega's wife
            Rosario Murillo. Lemoine quotes centre-right feminist Sofia
            Montenegro. Montenegro is a director of the USAID funded
            CINCO media organization&nbsp; and was revealed by a
            Wikileaks cable to have directly asked the US ambassador in
            Managua for US$100,000. This is the source Lemoine quotes
            describing Rosario Murillo as &#8220;a superstitious opportunist
            who talks about nothing but God and the Virgin Mary all day
            long.&#8221; No wonder Montenegro hates Rosario Murillo &#8211; Murillo
            has been the driving force behind Nicaragua's revolution in
            women's rights since January 2007.<br>
            <br>
            The revolution for women in Nicaragua itself has made the
            FSLN the most dynamic force for revolutionary change in
            Central America. Murillo's role in enforcing that change has
            been truly decisive. Likewise her self-evident partnership
            with Daniel Ortega in terms of formulating and executing
            policy is an inspiring model for women and young people in
            Nicaragua whose impact is impossible to overestimate.
            Lemoine's report wilfully ignores that reality, preferring
            to recycle long-discredited social democrat feminist lies
            only people ignorant of Nicaragua could possibly take
            seriously.<br>
            <br>
            The ideologically paid-on-both-sides character of LeMonde
            Diplomatique and writers like Maurice Lemoine becomes clear
            in the final paragraphs of this article on Nicaragua.
            Lemoine notes &#8220;Nobody mentioned socialism&#8221;, referring to the
            comments of ordinary people supportive of the FSLN
            government's policies. He then jumps from vox populi
            reporting to macro-economic policy, falsely juxtaposing and
            confusing two completely different kinds of reality.<br>
            <br>
            That obscurantist manoeuvre allows Lemoine to insert a banal
            and ignorant comment about ALBA in Nicaragua, &#8220;Huge amounts
            of aid from Hugo Ch&aacute;vez&#8217;s Venezuela &#8212; the 'orthodox,
            sterile, reactionary and authoritarian pseudo-left' that
            makes the MRS&#8217;s blood boil &#8212; have boosted the FSLN&#8217;s social
            programmes.&#8221; That sentence on its own gives a damning
            summary of the whole article.<br>
            <br>
            In Nicaragua,&nbsp; the MRS party is taken seriously only by
            its allies, right wing leaders like corrupt banker Eduardo
            Montealegre, right-wing gerontocrat Fabio Gadea and the
            Chamorro family's oligarch-poodle Edmundo Jarquin. Lemoine
            gives further currency to NATO country media distortion in
            relation to Nicaragua's ALBA development cooperation funding
            and concessionary oil transactions with PDVSA, summing up
            that complex trade and development relationship in the
            caricature &#8220;Huge amounts of aid from Hugo Chavez's
            Venezuela.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            Lemoine ends his article with a self-exculpatory admission
            from&nbsp; Maria L&oacute;pez Vigil of the Env&iacute;o
            magazine collective: &#8220;The ILP-MRS alliance is not based on a
            shared social project, programme or ideology. Its sole
            purpose is to stop the dictatorial tendencies of the FSLN
            and Ortega.&#8221; Here L&oacute;pez Vigil is trying to distance
            herself and her MRS accomplices from the dirty reality of
            their cynical self-serving deal with Nicaragua's right-wing.
            But she is hopelessly entangled in the facts of her
            complicity in seven years of determined collaboration with
            the imperialist agenda of the United States, Canada and the
            European Union.<br>
            <br>
            Back in 2007 she wrote this &#8220;I think and write this from
            Nicaragua, from Central America, from the societies of the
            Christian West that have still not overcome the traumas of
            the Conquest of 500 years ago nor the hierarchical framework
            of the Colonial centuries that followed. Daily we find this.
            We are countries that achieved formal independence little
            more than 150 years ago but continue being home to millions
            of people, the majority, who lack personal autonomy, who
            have never tasted it. We are societies with the
            institutionality &#8211; and also the theatricality &#8211; of democracy
            (separation of powers, periodic elections, institutions,
            posts, delegates in international bodies, costly processes
            of State modernization) but are strangers to everything or
            almost everything in democratic culture.&#8221;<br>
            <br>
            For L&oacute;pez Vigil, nothing has changed. She and her
            fellow MRS sympathizers continue to talk as if there is some
            universal common agreement about what constitutes
            &#8220;democratic culture&#8221;. She obviously continues to think that
            she and her colleagues know and understand what that culture
            is while the vast majority of people in Central America do
            not. This absurd attempt to monopolize the terminology of
            democracy is entirely consonant with NATO country
            psy-warfare in general and anti-FSLN propaganda in
            particular.<br>
            <br>
            It is natural that Le Monde Diplomatique offers a platform
            to journalism blatantly sympathetic to liberal elitists and
            intellectual frauds like Maria L&oacute;pez Vigil, Sofia
            Montenegro, Sergio Ramirez and their colleagues.&nbsp; Since
            the war against Libya it has become clear that the role of
            fake-progressive media like Le Monde Diplomatique has been
            to obscure inconvenient realities and to confuse and censor
            genuine debate. Under the government of President Daniel
            Ortega, Nicaragua has made truly dramatic progress in every
            sphere of national life, experiencing grass roots change
            that is truly revolutionary. Writers and media outlets that
            conceal this undeniable truth have self-evidently taken
            sides with the enemies of humanity.<br>
