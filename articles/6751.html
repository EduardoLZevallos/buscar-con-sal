<p><em><strong>June 23, 2019</strong></em></p>

<div class="text-align-center" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" width="458"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="252" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RstjYVd_SNg" width="448"></iframe><br />
<em>Comandante Daniel Ortega and Compañera Rosario Murillo<br />
honor Commander Carlos Fonseca Amador </em></div>

<p>Carlos, Carlos Fonseca... There is the mark of Carlos in our History. It is the same mark left by our ancestors who resisted the Colonizers, the mark of Diriangén.</p>

<p>It is the mark of the Heroic Combatants who defeated the foreign invader in San Jacinto. It is the footprint of José Dolores Estrada, the footprint of Andrés Castro throwing the stone against the Yankee invader. It is the footprint of General Benjamin Zeledon.</p>

<p>When the Yankee troops invaded Nicaragua and arrived to disembark in Corinto and then advance toward Masaya and surround the troops defending the Homeland, defending Nicaragua, the heroic troops headed by General Benjamin Zeledon, who when the the Yankee Colonel leading the US troops told him to surrender, Zeledón, just like Sandino, said: I neither sell out nor surrender!</p>

<p>And he fell fighting, Zeledón, in front of the invaders, and in front of the traitors, because the traitors and sell-outs are the ones who brought William Walker and the Yankees who wanted to take over Nicaragua; the traitors and sell-outs  are those who surrendered to the Yankee invaders and then invited them to occupy Nicaragua. And that is also where Zeledón's mark remains, a mark of Dignity, of defense of the Homeland, of Nicaragua and of the Nicaraguans.</p>

<p>Then there was our General of Free Men, Sandino. When the traitors and sell-outs handed their rifles over to the Yankee invaders and then knelt down and thanked them for invading Nicaragua, Sandino said: No, I won't sell myself, nor will I ever surrender! And Sandino then raised the Red and Black Flag to defend the Blue and White Flag of Nicaragua that was humiliated, dragged through the mud by the traitors and by the sell-outs.</p>

<p>It was the longest war Nicaragua had in all that time in front of the Yankee invaders, confronting the Yankee troops. In the end, the troops had to retreat because they could not, they could not make Sandino surrender to them or buy Sandino out? They couldn't!</p>

<p>And there is Sandino's mark, who, later with Colonel Santos López who rests in this place, with Carlos Fonseca, with Tomás, with Silvio Mayorga, raised again the Red and Black Flag to defend the Homeland and to lift up again  the Blue and White Flag of Nicaragua from the muddy swamp where it had sunk.</p>

<p>Carlos, here we are again fighting the Battle, fighting the Battle for Peace, for Dignity, for the Sovereignty of the Homeland, because all the Fighters throughout the History of Nicaragua, from Diriangén onwards, what did Diriangén want? Don't let invaders take their Land!</p>

<p><img alt="" height="275" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/247298.JPG" style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="450" /></p>

<p>Yes, it was their land, and others were coming from other continents to take possession of their land, and bloodily occupying these territories throughout our America. Our America occupied by invaders, by colonizers! Wherever there were entire peoples who only wanted peace, wanted to work, they inflicted death so as to steal their lands.</p>

<p>Those who fought the Battle in San Jacinto, led by José Dolores Estrada and Andrés Castro, did not seek war, they wanted peace for Nicaragua, but unfortunately the traitors brought Walker and provoked the war, but Walker who became President of Nicaragua, imposed himself as President of Nicaragua, was finally defeated.</p>

<p>But in his fury, and thinking that in this way he was going to frighten and make the people afraid, he committed the crime of setting fire to Granada, set fire to the city of Granada, and then his only choice was to continue fleeing to the Pacific Coast, in the Isthmus of Rivas, and US government ships came to rescue Walker and take him back to the United States.</p>

<p>Zeledón... Zeledón wanted peace, he had a family, and we all know that , Zeledón fell in combat on the very day of his birthday, October 4th. He did not look for that fight, he would have preferred to be with his Family; those who provoked the fight were the invaders from the North, the Yankee invaders, who arrived with their troops, and Zeledón had no alternative but to fight and defend Nicaragua and give his Life and leave his example that remains here in the conscience of the Nicaraguans.</p>

<p>Sandino saw Zeledón when his body was being dragged in the street, Sandino saw Zeledón's corpse, he relates it, and Sandino became conscious then and there as a child, as a boy. Sandino also did not seek war, he wanted peace, those who have brought war to Nicaragua, those who have attempted against peace in Nicaragua, are the traitors who have always invited invaders to bring war to Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Likewise, Carlos had no alternative but to fight and once again raise Sandino's Flag with the Sandinista Front, until Victory was achieved on July 19th 1979.</p>

<p>Today, on the anniversary of his birth, we tell Carlos that here we are always struggling to achieve peace, because we want peace, we don't want confrontation, we don't want wars, the peace that has cost us so much to conquer, that has cost us so much to achieve. We have had so many heroes, so many martyrs throughout our history to achieve peace, to conquer peace!</p>

<p>And we say to Carlos, we say to Diriangén, we say to José Dolores Estrada, to Andrés Castro, we say to Zeledón, and we say to Sandino: Here are your children, Divine Father, to defend Peace, firmly, with Dignity, without selling out nor ever surrendering!</p>

<p><em><strong>Remarks by Compañera Rosario, Vice President of Nicaragua, after the ceremony Commemorating the 83rd Birthday of Comandante Carlos Fonseca Amador</strong></em></p>

<p>June 23, 2019</p>

<div class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="458"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="252" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XbsIoZVU5w" width="448"></iframe><br />
<em>Compañera Rosario Murillo: Nicaragua is free<br />
because it has sons and daughters who love her</em></div>

<p>Good afternoon, and a big hug to all the Dads on this Father's Day, which we celebrate by asking God that each day we have more responsible Fathers, and that the Fathers behave with more responsibility throughout the country. Not only is this Love and Affection, but from Love and Affection derive responsibility for the Home, for the Family, Respect between Couples, and responsible care for Children, for Adolescents.</p>

<p>A big embrace to all Trusting and in Hope that We Go Forward long that Route of Respect, of Harmonious Coexistence in the Family, in the Community, and for loving and responsible Parents who grow with those Values that we have in our Nicaragua. Because in our Nicaragua the advantage, the privilege that we have is that it is a Homeland where the Values of Family and Community distinguish us. We are a People where the Family counts and where the Family strengthens us, because we support each other all the time, unconditionally.</p>

<p>Today is Father's Day, today we commemorate Carlos, and today we are gathered here, gathered together, committing ourselves, as we do every day, with AMORANICARAGUA, with the Good Life, with the Dignity of Nicaragua which is the Good Life that we Nicaraguan Families want; Life in Harmony, Life in Peace and Fraternal Life, as Jesus Christ commands, because this is a Christian People, of Faith, Hope and Trust in God.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="275" src="https://www.el19digital.com/files/galerias/247270.JPG" style="float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="450" /></p>

<p>23rd today, tomorrow is the 24th, St. John's Day, in many countries it is celebrated by a great manu people, it has many Traditions, and here are many Municipalities that honor St. John the Baptist.</p>

<p>And we who follow all that Festive Calendar of the Nicaraguan Tradition, each day that we celebrate these Festivities we ask God, and we ask the Saints to intercede, so that we strengthen Reconciliation and Peace, meeting together, because our Nicaragua is a Land of Meeting, not of Estrangement, of Affection not of Hate, of Good not of Evil, of Peace and Good, not Perversity.</p>

<p>So, every day, every day, invoking God to strengthen the Routes of Work and Peace, of Security, of Hope and of Fraternal Love that we must build and strengthen every day.</p>

<p>A Dignified People, a People that wants Tranquility, Security to advance, a People that has respected itself throughout its History, our History, and a People that continues to show itself full of Spirit, full of Capacity, full of Strength, and above all full of Respect and Dignity.</p>

<p>So, we honor Carlos Fonseca, we honor all the patrimony of heroism we have in our Nicaragua, all our heroes and martyrs, and with that inner fortress that faith gives us, we say: Nicaragua is free and will continue to be free because she has sons and daughters who love her, and we are able to transcend all the challenges, even the most difficult circumstances because we are united around the values of faith, Christianity and Solidarity. Thank you.</p>
