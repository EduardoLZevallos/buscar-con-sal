<p><strong>Message of Compañero Laureano Ortega</strong></p>

<p><strong>in Special Session of the SPIEF-2025</strong></p>

<p><strong>"Forging a Just and Sustainable World Ord</strong>er”</p>

<p>Thank you very much, dear Compañero, before also greeting this Heroine who has been presented by Compañera Zajárova, to her we pay our Tribute and our Honor, for everything the great sacrifice of the Soviet People, of the Russian people in the Second World War means.</p>

<p>We are with Russia today in this new battle it is waging against Fascism in Ukraine, we accompany it steadfastly. And we recognize the great sacrifice, which is the greatest human sacrifice any Country has ever given, for Peace in the World.</p>

<p>That sacrifice of the Second World War, of the Soviet People, of the Russian People, who continue today their struggle to liberate the whole world from Fascism.</p>

<p>Also the contribution that China made in that Battle against Fascism in the Second World War. And now, these two great World Leaders, President Putin, President Xi, are leading this march towards the New World Order, which means more justice for the World’s Peoples, especially for the Peoples of the Global South.</p>

<p>First of all, I want to refer to what has been Nicaragua's Historical Cooperation with Russia, and that in recent years it has focused on Projects for Peace, for Life, for the Health of the Nicaraguan People, which has allowed us to have good Health Programs. An Institute where we produce vaccines to deal with the Flu, Dengue fever, and other ills that afflict the health of our populations.</p>

<p>And from Nicaragua promoting all these technologies to Central America and Latin America; and Russia is also cooperating with us in the field of Security and Defense.</p>

<p>We continue to make progress in this fraternal cooperation too in the field of the Media, which is extremely important, because we share Values, because we share this Vision of a Multipolar World, of a more just World. And it is extremely important to maintain this very close cooperation with the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>Likewise, we have re-established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China since 2021. We have followed a Path of extraordinary progress which has already been characterized by our Presidents, by President Xi, President Ortega, as a Strategic Partnership, and according to Compañero Wang Yi's own words, it places us at the forefront of China's relations with the countries of Latin America.</p>

<p>Because Nicaragua recognizes the great Leadership of President Xi, we support the Global Initiatives President Xi has proposed: The Belt and Road Initiative and the Initiatives of Global Development, Global Security, Global Civilization, which offers a light of Hope to Humanity, to find a way out of a very complex world where selfishness prevails, the imperialist mentality.</p>

<p>But together with these great Leaders like President Xi, hand in hand with Brother and Sister Countries like Nicaragua, like Venezuela, like Cuba, we are resisting, and contributing to the shaping of this New World Order.</p>

<p>In the same way, participating as part of what this new Order should be, based on Respect, we participated last month, on May 13th in Beijing, in the Meeting of the China-CELAC Ministerial Forum.</p>

<p>There President Xi presented five programs China will be developing with the Countries of Latin America: The Solidarity Program, the Development Program, the Civilization Program, the Peace Program and the Peoples Program; programs promoting Cooperation to the mutual benefit of us all.</p>

<p>And we want to reiterate that we firmly oppose all the illegal aggression that the United States has implemented against Russia, against China, against Nicaragua, against Venezuela, against Cuba, against the Free Peoples of the World; against Iran.</p>

<p>The illegal, so-called  sanctions, the tariff war, which has had a special focus against the People's Republic of China. And there is a real Machiavellian method that has been implemented in this new practice, for example, in Latin America, as regards Nicaragua.</p>

<p>To countries like Nicaragua, first they threatened to implement a tariff of more than 20%, and then, when the American President saw that this policy was generating great convulsion in the International Markets for stocks and bonds and in the world economy, and that a recession might even be looming for the United States, then, instead of tariffs that exceeded 20%, they would only apply 10% tariffs temporarily for three months.</p>

<p>That is, we are supposed to thank him because he did not hit us with such a big club but with a smaller club; something absurd and illegal, since it also breaks all the rules of International Trade.</p>

<p>Also now the manipulation around the Panama Canal, which they openly say should be the domain of the United States, and where they want to impose a blockade on the passage of Russian, Chinese and Iranian ships. An illegal, incorrect, unjust practice which we firmly oppose.</p>

<p>As our moderator told us, Nicaragua is a country that has resisted the onslaughts of attempts of domination of the American Empire. We have resisted them practically since Nicaragua became a Republic,.</p>

<p>We have had constant intervention by the United States, including invasions, and we managed to overcome them thanks to the Struggle of Sandino, of our Sandinista Revolution, and now, to the struggle by  our Government under the leadership of President Ortega.</p>

<p>In 2018, there was even an attempted coup d'état in Nicaragua, promoted by USAID, promoted by the United States and by its European allies. These are practices which continue to this day, for which it is extremely important to maintain this cohesion, this Strategic Alliance with Russia and with China.<br />
We have been actively participating in the meetings of the Security Council here at the Russian Federation Council, to continue working on defense against the attempts at Color Revolutions.</p>

<p>Well, now too, we see the wars that are being fought, the war being carried out against Palestine, the genocide against the Palestinian people by Israel, supported by the United States; and the illegal attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

<p>All this leads us to be clear that the Union of our Peoples will make us stronger, accompanying those new blocs such as the BRICS, such as the Eurasian Economic Union, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where everyone has a path to development, with equal treatment, with respect.</p>

<p>And to demand as well a refounding of the United Nations, of its Values, of its Principles. And on the part of Latin America and the Caribbean, on the part of CELAC, all our Latin American and Caribbean Brothers and Sisters should be clear that our only enemy is poverty and against that enemy that we have to be united and work together. Thank you.</p>
