: dumping theory, rediscovering humanity</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">by
toni solo, November 17th 2008</span> <br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The deep revolutionary
change the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) has
contributed to human progress is its insistence on the moral dimension
of economic policy. No capitalist framework would have been able to
develop a commitment to accessible credit, health and education
programmes like Mission Miracle (eye-care) or Yes I Can (literacy), or
to complement energy security programmes with measures to promote food
security. In doing this, the ALBA strategists have abandoned the
anti-humanitarian capitalist model and recovered humanism's political
and moral bases. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And if one
thing is clear from the rich-country response to the economic collapse
their own governments and elites engendered, it is that their response
prioritises the elites above their peoples. It had to be that way.
Capitalism concentrates power and control of resources in the hands of
a few corporations and the elite that controls them. The government
rescue plans of the United States and Europe protect above all,
massively so, the major financial institutions and focuses only as an
afterthought on the real economy, on workers and their families.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The economist
Paul Craig Roberts, a veteran of the Reagan administration, has noted
that while Treasury Secretary Paulson has approved US$700bn for the
banks, he refuses to help families at risk of losing their homes with a
much more modest sum of US$25bn. In similar vein, many economists have
remarked on the absurdity of expecting international financial
institutions, especially the IMF, to adequately manage the resources
necessary to sustain some balance of legitimacy in the world economy.
The IMF answers to its masters in the US Treasury,</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Few admit
that the fiasco is not just the long overdue denouement of
neo-liberalism but of the capitalist free market system as such. Free
markets do not exist, have never existed and never will exist. The real
argument is over what the objectives of market regulation should be.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">If one reads
documents published by the World Bank or the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development or the International Monetary Fund and
perhaps to a lesser degree the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean, the dominant impression is that the suffering of
millions of people is of secondary importance. All these institutions
express their criteria and arguments as if some level of theoretical
reality takes precedence over human life. A corollary of this mentality
is an apparently complete absence of any historical sense in these
organizations.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">For example,
if one reads the OECD publication "Economic perspectives for Latin
America 2009", its focus is on the role of fiscal structures in
relation to development. The authors note that governments' fiscal
income in Latin America is less - 23%- in proportion to those of the
OECD countries - 42%. Within the text, the authors note in passing that
this fact is caused by the overall poverty of most of the population in
the countries concerned. They note, "A change of focus is needed if
Latin American governments are going to fully exploit the potential of
fiscal policy as a tool for development."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">One finds no
mention at all of the role played by rich country impositions, through
various coercive and inequitable means, in denying to Latin American
countries the development their peoples need. The authors'
presuppositions derive from the Washington Consensus which has been an
ideological support of international financial institution policy for
around 20 years. Perhaps it is not surprising that the collapse of the
"free market" capitalist system since July 2007 seems to have had such
a superficial impact on the theory of the managerial class running
those international financial institutions.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Outside the
rarefied theoretical constructs of institutions dominated by Western
Bloc governments, another dynamic is developing that may well converge
with the development of ALBA. After participating in the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to be held in Lima, Peru on November
22nd and 23rd, Russia's President Medvedev will visit Brazil and
Venezuela. Prior to the APEC meeting, China's President Hu Jintao is
visiting Costa Rica, Cuba and Peru. The coincidence of these visits during
the worst economic crisis for decades is unlikely to be accidental. It
must surely have something to do with a fundamental problem that China
and, to a lesser extent, Russia have as a result of US dollar hegemony
as the world's reserve currency.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">China and
Russia have large reserves of US dollars that have been losing value
significantly as a result of the desperate monetary and financial
policies of the United States authorities as they try to halt their
economy's free fall. China and Russia have to buy dollars in the form
of US government debt because if they do not then their own currencies
will rise in value to the detriment of their trade balance and with
consequent unwelcome effects on their domestic economies.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The problem
for them and other countries in a similar position is how to spend
their huge dollar reserves in a way that promotes the development of
their own economies. One way might be through significant investment in
resource
rich countries in Latin America and Africa. Guaranteeing strong
cooperation ties with suppliers of vital resources to China, this type
of investment
could also be beneficial for Latin American economies. These, like the
rest
of the world, could be more and more adversely affected by the
reluctance of the big US financial institutions to release dollars into
international financial markets. Economists in China have insisted
publicly already that an alternative to the dollar as the world's
reserve currency must be found.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Progressive
economists in the United States like Dean Baker y Mark Weisbrot of the
Center for Economic and Policy Research stress two vital aspects as a
response to the crisis. In general, Baker argues the importance of
permitting a budget deficit to promote investment in productive capital
and infrastructure. His argument has been reinforced lately by China's
announcement that it will invest almost US$600bn to develop its
domestic economy - apparently to compensate for falling demand for
Chinese imports in the US market. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In a response
to a question for this article, Baker writes as regards the US, "the
real force to boost the economy in the short-term will have to be large
amounts of fiscal stimulus. There should be a large dose of stimulus
(@2-3 percent of GDP) to try to keep the U.S. economy going in the
short-term. Over the longer-term, the dollar will have to fall to bring
the trade deficit closer to balance. The fall in the dollar will lead
to a reduction in living standards, but if the economy is otherwise
growing at a healthy pace, the impact will be relatively limited (e.g.
a 3 percent decline in living standards due to the drop in the dollar
would be equal to about 2 years productivity growth.)"</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Of course,
the position of each one of the countries in Central America, the
Caribbean or the Andean region will be different one way or another.
But it is impressive that ALBA prioritised exactly that kind of
investment even before the rich country crisis that now threatens the
whole world. The cause of that foresight on the part of the ALBA
countries seems obvious. The regions benefiting from ALBA had been in
crisis already, precisely because they were victims of perennial
predatory policies of greedy rich countries, now in crisis themselves.
The issue of an adequate management of balance of payments is another
area in which the ALBA countries have already been planning a
potentially strong response in the form of the ALBA bank and perhaps,
if they can clear current obstacles, the Bank of the South.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In response
to a question for this article about the relevance of an ALBA bank now,
Dean Baker's CEPR colleague Mark Weisbrot argues, "It will be important
in the short run for the ALBA countries, with others as much as
possible, to co-ordinate their responses to the current financial
crisis and economic downturn. Over the longer run they will need to
build and extend institutions to foster regional integration and
development. Some agreement on the sharing of reserves could be very
important in the near future. In terms of co-ordinating their response
to the current situation, there may be a potential for organizing their
own collective effort to borrow from the surplus countries (e.g. the
oil producers and China) who have excess reserves, creating an
alternative to the current effort by the United States and UK to
channel any such funds through the IMF. They may also be able to use
the existing FLAR (Latin American Reserve Fund)."</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">While the
conditions and space to manoeuvre exist, then the suggestions and
arguments of economists like Baker and Weisbrot will be useful. But the
clock is ticking. The crisis is in the early stages of what is likely
to be, at least, a damaging worldwide recession. Most likely options
for less developed country economies will begin to run out fast through
the first quarter of 2009. In that economic context, the imperialist
powers of North America and Europe will seek to exploit political
crises in Latin America so as to recoup lost influence and control. It
is a new modulation of the challenges and rich country hostility that
have faced the ALBA countries from the start. People around the world
will be hoping it is another challenge the ALBA countries, led by
Venezuela and Cuba, will beat.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;">
