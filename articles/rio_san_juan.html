      <span style="font-style: italic;">As a result of the ongoing
territorial dispute provoked by Costa Rica, Nicaragua's R&iacute;o San
Juan has been the subject of news stories run by media outlets around
the world over the last two months. As part of an attempt to
contextualize the sudden media attention being focused on Nicaragua's
south eastern most corner, Tortilla con Sal provides a historical and
demographic profile of what until recently has been one of Nicaragua's
most forgotten and marginalized departments &#8211; the department of
R&iacute;o San Juan &#8211; together with a summary of the major public
investments that have been made in the region since the FSLN came to
power in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br>

      <br>
The department of R&iacute;o San Juan is situated in the south eastern
corner of Nicaragua on the border with Costa Rica. R&iacute;o San Juan
is the scene of a continuing frontier dispute between the two
countries. The conflict highlights the department's two most enduring
characteristics. <br>
      <br>
Firstly, Rio San Juan is important for historical reasons as a transit
route between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Secondly, the area has
contemporary geopolitical importance both for its wealth of
biodiversity and for its immense and vital water resources. Those
resources flow into the R&iacute;o San Juan via Nicaragua's two great
lakes from watersheds along the greater part of Nicaragua's Pacific
Coast. <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The historical importance of
R&iacute;o San Juan</span> <br>
      <br>
While its biological wealth and water resources are often considered
the region's most valuable asset, other aspects of the department of
R&iacute;o San Juan merit equal interest, not least the historical
importance of the region during the colonial era when the River served
as a main transportation route for cargo and passenger ships between
Central America and Spain in the 16th, 17th and early 18th century. <br>
      <br>
In the mid 1600s the English established control over all of what is
now Nicaragua's Caribbean Coast with the exception of the southern most
coastal area including the River San Juan delta which remained under
Spanish control. <br>
      <br>
From this time onwards the River San Juan and the various ports the
Spanish had built along the course of the river were the scene of
intense battles between English and Spanish forces as the English tried
to secure for themselves the lucrative opportunities control of the
river implied. Also during this period occasional battles between
Spanish forces and pirate ships took place along the river.<br>
      <br>
Subsequently, in the mid 19th century, the River was used to transport
passengers and cargo between the East and West coasts of the USA during
the Californian Gold Rush. The route continued to be used by American
companies up until the inauguration of the Panama Canal in 1914. <br>
      <br>
The legacy of that colonial history can still be appreciated today in
the Spanish built forts of San Carlos and El Castillo and in Greytown's
cemetery where numerous Spanish, English, US and even German citizens
who lived in the area during and subsequent to the colonial era are
buried.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Between the beginning of the 20th century (after the imperialist powers
lost interest in the river as an international transportation route)
and the first few years of the 21st century, however, the department of
R&iacute;o San Juan became one of Nicaragua's most forgotten and
marginalized regions. With little to no public investment in basic
infrastructure, the region became effectively cut off from the rest of
the country.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">From key international transport
route to neglected Cinderella</span><br>
      <br>
This transformation of the R&iacute;o San Juan region from a much
coveted key strategic point for both the Spanish and US empires in
centuries past to one of Nicaragua's most isolated regions today in
many ways adds to the mystical and enchanting nature the area conjures
up from an intellectual point of view. For the region's people,
however, the decades of neglect have resulted in a poor standard of
living for the majority. <br>
      <br>
Made up of six municipalities (Morrito, San Miguelito, El Castillo, San
Carlos, El Almendro and San Juan de Nicaragua) the department of
R&iacute;o San Juan constitutes nearly 6% of Nicaragua's total
territory although the population only represents 1.6% of the country's
5.74 million citizens. <br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Financial poverty in R&iacute;o
San Juan </span><br>
      <br>
As can be seen in the table above, the population of R&iacute;o San
Juan is overwhelmingly rural based with a little over three quarters of
the total population living in the countryside. It is also a very young
population: 50% of the inhabitants of R&iacute;o San Juan are 17 or
younger <a
 href="http://www.mined.gob.ni/PDF08/censo%20escolar_completocorregido30608.pdf">according
to statistics published by the Ministry of Education</a> (MINED) in
2007. <br>
      <br>
The majority of rural dwellers in the department are subsistence
farmers with very little cash income. The main economic activities of
large land owners, meanwhile, are cattle farming and the timber trade. <br>
      <br>
According to the <a
 href="http://inide.gob.ni/pobreza/publicacion/mapapobreza2001.pdf">Extreme
Poverty Map</a>, published by the Nicaraguan government in 2001, 36.3%
of the population has an income of less than the established extreme
poverty rate, well above the national extreme poverty rate at that time
of 24.2%.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This study defines a person in a state of extreme poverty as someone
whose &#8220;annual income &#8230; is insufficient in terms of fulfilling their
minimum calorie requirements even if the entirety of their income is
spent on food.&#8221;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
At the time the study was carried out the extreme poverty rate was
fixed at US$212 per capita a year.<br>
      <br>
The Map of Extreme Poverty goes on to classify two of R&iacute;o San
Juan's municipalities (El Castillo and San Miguelito) as severely poor
while the other four (San Carlos, El Almendro, Morrito and San Juan de
Nicaragua) were classified as very poor municipalities (severely poor
and very poor are the two lowest categories used to measure overall
cash income in Nicaragua's municipalities as part of the Map of Extreme
Poverty).<br>
      <br>
Of course, this method of measuring poverty is far from perfect given
its exclusive focus on cash income which very often is not the defining
factor in terms of the population's own perception of their standard of
living. More often than not factors such as access to basic health
services or to basic sanitation and safe drinking water have more of an
impact in this regard than the ability or not to earn a given amount of
money each year. <br>
      <br>
This is especially true in an area like R&iacute;o San Juan where the
majority of the population depends on subsistence farming for their
livelihood. Rather than cash income, key factors in terms of the
population's ability to satisfy their calorie requirements are things
like land ownership and access to basic agricultural inputs.<br>
      <br>
The Map of Poverty statistics on R&iacute;o San Juan are valuable
though, in the extent to which they permit an understanding of the
economic marginalization of the area. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">State of education in R&iacute;o
San Juan </span><br>
      <br>
According to information published by the Ministry of Education (MINED)
in 2007, the state of education in the municipalities of R&iacute;o San
Juan leaves much to be desired. In a <a
 href="http://www.mined.gob.ni/PDF08/ieem2007_actualizadomayo08_a.pdf">study
called the State of Education by Municipality</a> (IEEM) (MINED ranked
all the municipalities of Nicaragua taking into account factors to do
with accessibility and quality of education. <br>
      <br>
As part of this study, where the municipality with the best IEEM
ranking is number 1 and the municipality with the worst IEEM ranking is
number 153, the municipalities of R&iacute;o San Juan were placed in
the following positions: <br>

The same study also revealed that the average level of schooling among
the adult population is 3rd grade (primary 3) and that, in 2007, only
26.5% of the secondary school age population actually attended school.
In total 36.8% of the school aged population in R&iacute;o San Juan
were not studying in 2007. The main reasons given for not attending
school were a lack of interest (28.5%), the nearest school being too
far away (18.8%) and financial problems (16.9%). <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Public investment in R&iacute;o
San Juan since 2007</span><br>
      <br>
Since coming to power in January 2007 the FSLN government led by
President Daniel Ortega has prioritized R&iacute;o San Juan as a
destination for major public investment. So far the main investments
the government has made in the region have focussed on two aspects &#8211;
road infrastructure and tourist infrastructure &#8211; although numerous
smaller investment projects in other areas have also been carried out
or will be between now and 2014. <br>
      <br>
The following table details the main public investments that have been
made in R&iacute;o San Juan since 2007 as well as the public
investments planned for the region between 2011 and 2014 for which the
government has already identified funding sources. (Note: investments
by several government institutions including the Ministries of Energy
and Agriculture have not been included in this table due to a lack of
publicly available specific information).&nbsp; <br>

The other major investment undertaken by the government in the region
is the dredging of the River San Juan with the aim of restoring
previous water levels in order to permit navegation of the 30
kilometres before the delta of the river on the Caribbean Sea. <br>
      <br>
During the last two centuries, the final stretch of Nicaragua's River
San Juan has become increasingly sedimented as a result, in part, of
Costa Rica's dredging of its River Colorado. The current dredging of
the river, which involves a public investment of over US$2 million
according to some sources, is being carried out with the aim of
facilitating tourism in the region. Thus the dredging project forms
part of the government's integral tourist investment strategy for the
area. <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rio San Juan and ecological
tourism</span><br>
      <br>
That strategy is based on the area's unequalled biodiversity. Over a
third of R&iacute;o San Juan's 7,473 km squared of territory forms part
of the UNESCO designated R&iacute;o San Juan Biosphere Reserve
including vast swathes of virgin tropical humid forest and wetlands
areas. Among the major species found in the R&iacute;o San Juan
biosphere are the jaguar or american tiger, the tapir and the red and
green parrot.<br>
      <br>
According to the UNESCO website's <a
 href="http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=NIC+02">general
description of the R&iacute;o San Juan</a> Biosphere Reserve, the area
&#8220;covers an important variety of ecosystems representative of tropical
humid forests and wetlands, tidal marsh, coastal lagoons and estuaries
which are important shelters for rare or threatened animals and plant
genetic resources of the meso-American tropics.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
The government's emphasis on tourist investment, including the
construction of an airport in San Juan de Nicaragua among many other
projects, confirms the government's vision of the department of
R&iacute;o San Juan as a major tourist destination in Nicaragua, based
for the most part on the region's enviable biodiversity and water
resources. <br>
      <br>
Among the various projects financed by INTUR since 2007 are the
construction of tourist information centres in Solentiname and San Juan
de Nicaragua, the construction of an immigration office at Los Guatuzos
facilitating the entrance of tourists from Costa Rica, major
improvements to San Carlos' lake front and port, restauration of
historical sites in Greytown and extensive training and support for
micro, small and medium tourist businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The extent to which this government has prioritized tourist investment
in the region is underlined by the fact that roughly 90% of the
Nicaraguan Tourist Institute, INTUR's entire investment budget over the
last four years has been designated to different investments in
R&iacute;o San Juan. <br>
      <br>
With the growth of tourist generated income in Nicaragua from US$230
million to US$345.9 million between 2006 and 2009 (a 50% increase in
three years) the FSLN government's efforts to facilitate and promote
R&iacute;o San Juan as a tourist destination are more likely than ever
to produce positive short term results in terms of increased economic
activity in the area.&nbsp; <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Road to San Carlos set to
transform life in R&iacute;o San Juan </span><br>
      <br>
The project to pave 125 kilometers of road between Acoyapa in the
department of Chontales and San Carlos, the capital of R&iacute;o San
Juan, is probably the one infrastructural improvement most anticipated
by the local population. Until recently, the road connecting San Carlos
to the rest of the country was in infamously dire condition with long
stretches of road that became basically impassable during the six
months of the rainy season each year. Even during the dry season it
used to take eight hours to travel the approximately 235 kilometers
between Managua and San Carlos (an average of 29 km an hour). <br>
      <br>
The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) expects that once
the road paving project is completed over the next year or so the
travelling time to and from Managua be reduced to four
hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">Mayor of San Carlos, Johnny
Guti&eacute;rrez, <a
 href="http://www.el19digital.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2534:construiran-carretera-acoyapa-san-carlos&amp;catid=23:nacionales&amp;Itemid=12">describes
the completion of this project</a> as &#8220;an age old dream for the
population of R&iacute;o San Juan, not just because we will be able to
travel in more comfort, but because our region has great economic
potential.&#8221; <br>
      </div>
      <br>
According to Guti&eacute;rrez, the main benefit this project will bring
is a reduction in the cost of living for the local population which in
turn will facilitate greater economic activity for the different
productive sectors. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MINED hopes to build 27 new
schools in R&iacute;o San Juan over the next few years</span><br>
      <br>
Although funding is as yet unconfirmed, it is worth pointing out that
the Ministry of Education has selected the departments of R&iacute;o
San Juan and Chontales as the recipients of over US$8 million in
cooperation funding as part of the proposed Japan Phase VI project
which would involve the construction of 48 new schools (27 in
R&iacute;o San Juan and 21 in Chontales) during coming years. In 2009
the proposed project was presented to the Japanese Ambassador in
Managua who committed himself to securing funding for the project from
the Japanese government. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In prioritizing R&iacute;o San
Juan, government demonstrates radically different approach to that of
Neoliberal governments</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
The evident intention of prioritizing the department of R&iacute;o San
Juan as the destination for major public investments is a sign of the
radical change that has occured in Nicaraguan public policy since the
right wing parties left office.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The neoliberal logic on which the previous three governments based
their policies encouraged the designation of public resources for the
development and benefit of big international businesses operating in
the country, provoking in this way a state of human and economic
stagnation in most regions of the country particularly in remote and
rural areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The logic behind the Sandinista government policies, on the contrary,
prioritizes and benefits small scale economies by investing public
resources in the most cut off and neglected areas as part of what
appears to be a strategy to initiate a process of wealth
redistribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The government's focus on the department of R&iacute;o San Juan also
suggests the patriotic nature of current public policy in as much as it
demonstrates the government's willingness to protect and defend the
territorial integrity of Nicaragua in a more profound sense than the
conventional implementation of millitary or juridical border defense
policies. In this case the government is defending the nation's
territorial integrity by creating a sense of belonging, even a feeling
of pride of being Nicaraguan, among the population of one of the most
remote areas along Nicaragua's southern border. <br>
