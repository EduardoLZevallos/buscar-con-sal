President Manuel Zelaya arrived at the Honduran frontier post of Las
Manos on the Nicaraguan border at about 1.00pm on Friday July 24th. His
purpose was to try and open a dialogue with Honduran police and army
officials in order to try and enter Honduras, reunite with his wife and
children and his mother, and attempt to resume his role as the
country's elected President. He was accompanied to the border by a
throng of international news media who covered his every move at times
making it almost impossible for him to proceed.<br><br>Shortly after
arriving at the no-man's-land between the respective Nicaraguan and
Honduran immigration offices, President Zelaya was able to converse
with the local army commander, the colonel in charge of the military
forces deployed in the area between Las Manos and the nearest Honduran
town, El Paraíso, about 15km from the border. It became clear that he
ran the risk of immediate detention were he to enter Honduras.<br><br>That
moment must have been one of great anguish for President Zelaya,
kidnapped at gunpoint nearly a month ago and expelled to Costa Rica by
the usurper coup regime of General Vasquez and Roberto Micheletti.
That regime is rejected as illegitimate by every government in the
world. Honduras has been expelled from the Organization of American
States. Aid donors like the European Union have suspended hundreds of
millions of aid funds. Likewise, for the moment, the World Bank has
also suspended loan disbursements to the Honduran coup regime. <br><br>President
Zelaya's presence at Las Manos represents the latest stage in what has
turned into a war of attrition. On one side are deployed President
Zelaya himself, his team of ministers, the governments of the ALBA
countries - Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela and three
Caribbean island nations - and the growing movement of popular
resistance inside Honduras. On the other side are the business elite
leaders of the coup regime, totally dependent on the repressive power
of the army, the administration of Barack Obama that has refused to
accept that the current regime is the result of a coup d'etat,
right-wing US Senators like Connie Mack, and Latin America's network of
oligarchies represented by leaders like narco-terror President Alvaro
Uribe of Colombia or Nicaraguan opposition politicians like Eduardo
Montealegre.<br><br>The fundamental reality of the current situation is
that President Zelaya needs to keep up as much pressure as he can on
the coup regime by mobilizing both international support as well as
encouraging or inspiring popular resistance inside Honduras. He has the
unconditional support of the ALBA countries which in economic terms
means he can keep up the pressure indefinitely. On the other hand the
coup regime has to rely on diminishing resources that can only be
partly replenished by the reactionary right-wing networks of the
Americas, coordinating frantically now in this crucial battle of wills
for control of a country that is a vital to sustain US imperial
domination in the region.<br><br>Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's Foreign
Minister said of the situation, President Zelaya "is invested with all
the legality, the whole world's moral support to begin his way back to
his post as President of Honduras. This is the beginning of that path.
It could well be a difficult path, a complicated path. And as he
himself has said, President Zelaya wants this to be a peaceful process.
He is a man of peace...he has the legitimacy given him by the people of
Honduras who have heroically resisted 27 days of struggle in the
streets...and it has already been demonstrated now that the power of
the Honduran people is not going to be defeated. This is a process that
is just beginning."<br><br>Inside Honduras<br><br>While international
opinion seems overwhelmingly favourable to President Zelaya, inside
Honduras popular resistance too seems to be growing. International
corporate media coverage of the crisis has been at best patchy and at
worst non-existent. But the crisis is at least as strategically
important as the post-election crisis in Iran and popular resistance has
been at least, if not more, widespread than in that country.<br><br>Every
day for the last two weeks the country's main roads have been blocked
for long periods by mass demonstrations. One demonstration blocking the
commercially vital road link between the main industrial town, San
Pedro Sula, and the country's biggest port, Puerto Cortes, was reported
by its organizers to have involved at one time up to 18,000 people.
Other vital roads that have been persistently blocked by demonstrations
include the four main roads out of the capital Tegucigalpa, the main
highway through the vast fruit and palm-oil plantations between La
Ceiba and Trujillo and the main highway through the huge agricultural
area of the department of Olancho.<br><br>Reports by international human
rights delegations in Honduras to verify accusations of serious
widespread abuses and violations have confirmed a dramatic
deterioration in the protection of basic rights throughout the country.
Honduras is under a state of emergency with all the normal
constitutional guarantees suspended. The number of murders of
demonstrators and popular movement activists grew this weekend with the
discovery of the badly mutilated body of 23 year old Pedro Magdiel
Muñoz Salvador in El Paraíso on the morning of July 25th. <br><br>Muñoz
Salvador was allegedly arrested by police on the evening of Friday the
24th. His sinister murder adds to those of two popular movement
activists in the north of the country and the cold blooded murder of
Isis Obed Murillo by an army sniper on July 5th. The obvious
interpretation of Muñoz Salvador's murder is as an attempt by the
security forces to terrorize his fellow protesters and deter them from
continuing to protest so assertively. <br><br>The same day of Muñoz
Salvador's murder the security forces detained Rafael Alegría, Via
Campesina leader and deputy for the left-wing Unificación Democrática
political party in the Honduran National Congress. Alegría is a leading
member of the Honduran popular movement and a key organizer of the
national protests against the coup regime. His detention was confirmed
by fellow popular movement leader Dr Juan Almendares to Radio Globo.
Radio Globo is now almost the only independent national news media in
the country reporting the nationwide protests.<br><br>There can be no
doubt now that Honduras is in practice a military regime. Confirmation
of that view came on Friday morning in an interview on a Radio Globo
phone-in when the head of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights
in Honduras, Andres Pavón, made precisely that argument. Pavon
explained that when he goes to the local courts to process the various
cases he is handling, he finds soldiers patrolling the law courts.
Further confirmation of the military character of the coup regime was
given by President Manuel Zelaya's Vice-Minister for Health, Dr.
Alfonso Diaz Pon.<br><br>Interviewed in Las Manos on July 24th, Dr Pon
related his efforts to travel home to Tegucigalpa only to find that the
militarization of the highway made it almost impossible for ordinary
people to travel freely. He said, "We are in a militarized country. You
go out on the street and find military vehicles there. You drive down
the highway and you find soldiers searching people. There is a curfew.
Constitutional guarantees have been suspended. All the institutions are
militarized. You go to Hondutel (the national phone company) and you
find soldiers running the administration. You go to the Presidential
offices and they are full of soldiers. Freedoms are restricted
everywhere in the country."<br><br>Despite the strong and apparently
growing repression, popular resistance too seems to be growing. The
general strike called for last Thursday and Friday virtually shut the
country down. The strike call has been renewed for Monday and into the
rest of the coming week. The policy of military and police repression
seems to be counterproductive. This was made clear on Thursday 23rd and
Friday 24th when people from all over the country responded to
President Zelaya's call to travel to meet him at Las Manos.<br><br>Thousands
of people headed for El Paraíso from all over the country, from the
western departments of Intibucá and Lempira, from the northern
departments of Colon, Copán and Atlantida and from the big eastern
department of Olancho. Buses carrying people headed for El Paraíso were
stopped by police and soldiers in various places. At El Zamorano, about
60 kilometres from El Paraíso, people from the northern towns of Tocoa,
Sonaguera and Olanchito were forced to get off several buses and told
they would be shot if they tried to proceed further. Despite those
threats thousands of people managed to make it to El Paraíso and small
groups totalling between 300 to 500 made it to Las Manos on the
Nicaragua side by trekking tens of kilometres over daunting hill
terrain. <br><br>Zelaya's position now in Nicaragua<br><br>Manuel
Zelaya's strategy of attrition depends on the support he is getting
from the ALBA countries. Most immediately he depends on the support of
the Nicaraguan government to be able to sustain his campaign at Las
Manos. Right wing politicians like Eduardo Montealegre have called for
President Zelaya's expulsion from Nicaragua. That is most unlikely to
happen. But it dramatically demonstrates the great sympathy leaders of
the Central American oligarchies have for their Honduran counterparts
who provoked the military coup on Honduras.<br><br>Even so, the
Nicaraguan government has been very careful not to figure publicly
alongside Manuel Zelaya and his Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas in
their activities at Las Manos. The Sandinista government remains very
much in the background. On Friday night, local community organizations
assisted the Sandinista mayor of Ocotal in organizing accommodation for
the hundreds of Zelaya supporters from Honduras who had trekked
overland to meet their president. <br><br>Over this weekend, a camp is
being set up ready to receive more Hondurans determined to travel to
Nicaragua one way or another to be with their elected President. If it
were not for the vicious military repression there is no doubt at all
thousands of Hondurans would be in Las Manos already. On Monday July
27th, the response to the renewed general strike call will give a good
idea of whether or not the military repression is achieving its aim.
But the death of Pedro Muñoz Salvador, rather than cowing people, is
likely to inflame opinion in Honduras and put even more pressure on the
illegitimate coup regime than ever.<br><br>toni writes for www.tortillaconsal.com</td></tr></tbody></table><br>
