<p><strong>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA<br />
AND LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN<br />
IN THE NEW ERA<br />
<br />
Tuesday, 10th May, 2022</strong></p>

<p>1. The Delegation of Nicaragua shares this cordial meeting with joy and enthusiasm and conveys the fraternal greetings of the President of the Republic of Nicaragua, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and Comrade Vice President Rosario Murillo.</p>

<p>2. We greet with esteem, affection and respect the delegation of the People's Republic of China, its people and its Government recognized by the International Community.</p>

<p>3. The global strategic vision of China shared with Latin America and the Caribbean, projecting the initiatives of the Belt and Road and Global Development, for the construction and development of a united Human Community with a Shared Future, as well as Brother President Xi Jinping's proposal of the Initiative for Global Security, all of which constitute strategies and policies of common interest and benefit for China and Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>4. These times of dynamic changes, of many challenges that occur consecutively such as pandemics, inequality, climate change, threats to international peace and security, and economic recovery, force us to overcome difficulties together, generating opportunities to continue developing and strengthening a China-Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Community to advance and develop with mutual benefit.</p>

<p>5. With the diversity of countries and governments that we have in this hemisphere, we continue to work together to consolidate cooperation between the People's Republic of China and Latin America and the Caribbean, upon the basis of respect, equality, plurality, inclusion, justice and compliance with the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace; deepening this relationship in a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, poverty eradication, innovation and the well-being of the people.</p>

<p>6. China and Latin America and the Caribbean are important for the maintenance of international peace and security, the promotion and protection of human rights, the defense of multilateralism, the promotion of sustainable, inclusive and resilient development, the elimination of poverty and the reduction of inequalities.</p>

<p>7. The relationship between China and Latin America and the Caribbean is characterized by mutual respect, respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, recognition of the territorial integrity of States, the right to development and the resolution of disputes through peaceful means.</p>

<p>8. We jointly reject the threat or use of force, as well as the unilateral coercive measures contrary to international law and the UN Charter, which threaten sovereignty and stability.</p>

<p>9. In this new era, we promote and develop Bilateral and Multilateral relations based on international law and multilateralism, mutual respect, fairness, justice, mutually beneficial cooperation and investment, seeking to shape a resilient world that is fairer and equitable.</p>

<p>10. This is a new time to strengthen and consolidate solidarity, mutual assistance and cooperation, which are necessary to overcome the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other urgent challenges.</p>

<p>11. In this new era, we jointly uphold a transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, institutionalized in order to promote world trade and sustainable development in a balanced and mutually beneficial manner, without protectionism or unilateralism.</p>

<p>12. We must continue to strengthen dialogue for cooperation, implement and develop norms and rules for cyberspace: address the misuse of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to incite and commit acts of terrorism; improve legal assistance mechanisms for cybercrime. In this sense, we highlight the Global Initiative on Data Security proposed and promoted by China.</p>

<p>13. In this 21st century, China and Latin America continue to strengthen relations and cooperation hand in hand in multiple areas, building a better shared future.</p>

<p>14. The President of the Chinese State, Xi Jinping, in his speech in 2015, entitled "Writing a New Chapter for a China-Latin America and the Caribbean Comprehensive Cooperation Association", expresses that the current world is characterized by transformations, which offers innumerable new opportunities and challenges, where the international system and order are subject to profound changes in which the correlation of forces evolves profoundly towards a course that is favorable to peace and development.</p>

<p>A large number of fast-growing developing and emerging market countries have vigorously pushed the development of the international order in a fairer and more reasonable direction. The time has come for joint progress and deepening cooperation between China and Latin America and the Caribbean. China and the countries of Latin America and Caribbean, together account for one fifth of the planet's land area, one third of the world's population and one eighth of the global economy, providing enormous advantages and valuable resources for the full development of relations between China and the region.</p>

<p>15. Common dreams and aspirations closely bind China and Latin America and the Caribbean. This is an era to uphold peace and an independent foreign policy, following the path of peaceful development and a win-win strategy of opening-up and of mutual benefit.</p>

<p>16. We continue deepening our will to join forces and build a new type of international relations that has cooperation, shared profit and the common good at its core.</p>

<p>17. The relationship between China and Latin America and the Caribbean is based on respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, cooperation and solidarity. In this relationship in the new era, 6 lines of work are identified, as they were recently presented in April 2022 at the successful Meeting of Foreign Ministers between China and the Caribbean Countries:</p>

<p>First, enhance mutual political trust, continue to support each other on issues involving each other's core interests, and uphold and practice true multilateralism.</p>

<p>Second, jointly promote post-pandemic economic recovery, push forward the deepening and consolidation of the joint construction of the Belt and Road, jointly implement the Global Development Initiative, and promote the raising of quality and improvement of pragmatic cooperation, in an attempt to contribute to the respective development of China and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Third, strengthen anti-pandemic and medical cooperation, improve public health governance, and build a health community between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p>

<p>Fourth, establish a pattern of popular and cultural exchanges with diversified interactions, and actively consider the orderly resumption of people-to-people exchange in the post-pandemic era.</p>

<p>Fifth, work together to meet the challenge of climate change.</p>

<p>Sixth, further intensify political communication between China and Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p>

<p>18. On 3rd December, 2021, the Third Ministerial Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) was held, where the Joint Action Plan for Cooperation in key areas China-CELAC (2022-2024) was adopted: Cooperation in Politics and Security, Economic Cooperation, Trade, Investment, Finance, Agriculture and Food, Innovation in Science and Technology, Industry and Information Technology, Aviation and Aerospace, Energy and Resources, Tourism, Customs and Taxes, Cooperation in High Quality Infrastructure, Social, Cultural and People-to-People Cooperation, Public Health, Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, Art and Sports, Higher Education, Think Tanks, Youth, Media and Communications, Local and Community Exchanges, International, Regional and Interregional Cooperation.</p>

<p>19. We continue to advance, promoting inclusive progress and a better life with well-being, in Peace, Security and Stability and with a new fair and equitable international order for the benefit of the peoples of Latin America, the Caribbean and China.</p>
