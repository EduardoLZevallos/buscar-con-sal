&nbsp;<br>
People in Latin America have frequently found themselves fighting
regular forces and mercenary contractors coordinated ultimately by the
United States Southern Command, the State Department and related US
government bodies. That was true in Central America in the 1980s. It
has been the case in Colombia for many years. On a smaller scale it is
happening now in Honduras. Shortly, they may well find themselves
fighting regular forces and mercenary contractors coordinated by NATO.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
2009 marked the transition via a practically seamless continuity in US
government foreign policy in Latin America from one gangster US
government administration to another. The international intellectual
and information-media manager classes have failed to report assertively
and adequately the US government's escalating war on the peoples of
Latin America. For overstretched US military forces, anxious to apply
pressure to perceived enemies in Latin America, resorting to NATO's
mutual defence Article 5 - as they have in Afghanistan - is an
attractive option.&nbsp; With its new military bases in Colombia, the
US government can readily provoke an incident as they did fifty years
ago in the Tonkin Gulf.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Venezuelan government recently expressed concern about the
intentions of the US government in relation to its bases in the Dutch
Antilles- Aruba and Curaçao. Holland is a member country of NATO. The
well known NATO war games known as Plan Balboa posited unequivocally a
joint NATO operation against Venezuela. Despite this, leading US
intellectuals like Noam Chomsky dismiss the chances of a US
government-led aggression against Venezuela. (1) Their failure of
imagination only makes sense in the broad economic, political and
propaganda context of the Americas.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;US economic context<br>
&nbsp;<br>
US domestic economic collapse and stagnation seems increasingly to be
provoking a militarist US foreign policy in regions around the world.
The domestic economic collapse is very clear. The US economy - still
losing many tens of thousands of jobs each month (even official figures
acknowledge over 2 million jobs lost since December 2007) - needs
100,000 new jobs a month to maintain employment equilibrium.
Unemployment in the US is unlikely to recover from current Depression
levels &#8211; the U-6 unemployment measure is currently over 17% - until
2015 at the earliest. Ignoring the employment crisis, from July 2007
through 2008, the US authorities &#8211; the US government and the Federal
Reserve &#8211; along with allied governments and their central banks, sought
to make good the liquidity problems of their vital private sector
partners among the major financial companies by stoking inflation. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
They hoped to protect bona fide banks and the so-called shadow banking
sector from the imploding real estate bubble. For a while, that
strategy shored up failing strategic financial partners &#8211; US government
supported entities, US Primary Government Securities Dealers and their
parent companies (2) as well as the giant, world-wide American
Insurance Group (AIG). (AIG on its own has been the beneficiary of over
US$127 billion dollars in US government (i.e. taxpayer) support. That
is ten times Nicaragua's annual budget). In the end, the inflationary
binge, culminating in July 2008 with oil at US$147, failed to make good
the bankrupt US financial sector. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the subsequent phase of the crisis, from July 2008 until March or
April 2009, Western Bloc governments, central banks and major financial
institutions coordinated action that helped encourage global investors
and speculators to buy more US Treasury bonds instead of stocks and
commodities. That deflationary dynamic dramatically strengthened the US
dollar on the international currency markets. It rapidly depressed
commodity prices and stocks. The abruptness, incredible size and sheer
volatility of market movements frightened US legislators into bailing
out insolvent financial institutions. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
This phase of the crisis involved a massive redistribution of wealth
from the majority of taxpayers in the United States to a corrupt
plutocrat elite. Once their rescue by government was guaranteed, the
elite's indispensable accomplice institutions &#8211; principally the Primary
Government Securities Dealers and their parent companies - returned to
the international casino of currency, commodity and stock markets,
reinforcing their gambling reserves with many billions of dollars of
taxpayers' money. By the end of 2009 US banks were paying out record
bonuses to staff, while, in the rest of the economy, unemployment,
mortgage foreclosures and bankruptcies soared to levels unprecedented
in recent history.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Economic crisis : militarist foreign policy<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A very strong correlation exists between that blatant domestic
intervention by the US authorities to rescue the country's financial
and insurance sector and militarist US government foreign policy. In
Colombia, increased direct intervention via seven new US military bases
now follows billion-dollar military funding for the US government's
narco-terror ally, President Alvaro Uribe. In Mexico, Felipe Calderon's
usurper government, a few years behind, follows in Uribe's footsteps.
Via Plan Merida, the US government is funding intense militarization of
Mexico's narcotics wars, just as it did in Colombia from the late 1990s
onwards.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In Colombia, more than US$5 billion has been spent in recent years so
as to deliberately fail to end the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;. Narcotics are the
economic base of Uribe's political, army and paramilitary allies.
Narcotics profits are also a vital component of the US dominated
international financial system. UN Office on Drugs and Crime head,
Antonio Costa, has asserted that as much as US$325 billion in narcotics
profits helped to fund major international banks through their
liquidity crisis in 2008 and 2009. (3) His apparently startling
announcement covers up the reality that international off-shore
tax-havens routinely channel hundreds of billions of illicit funds
every year into the international financial system.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The US has now signed an agreement to install seven military bases for
its military forces on unprecedentedly humiliating, quasi-colonial
terms for Colombia's sovereignty. The targets of that military
escalation are not Alvaro Uribe's narcotics allies but the undefeated
anti-government Colombian guerrilla movements, the democratically
elected governments of Venezuela and Ecuador, and, too, Brazil, the
main rival to US regional dominance. The US government is provoking
this deliberate regional destabilization in pursuit of political and
economic outcomes beneficial to US and allied corporate interests.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In Central America, the United States government effectively
facilitated the June 28th military coup against President Manuel
Zelaya, subsequently treating Zelaya on equal terms with the coup
leaders and deliberately undermining the continental anti-coup-regime
consensus. By means of the electoral farce in Honduras of November
29th, the Obama government has sought to legitimize the coup,
recovering and securing a base from which to apply pressure against
other countries in the region. US government targets for
destabilization in Central America are the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua, the centre-left government of El Salvador, based on the
Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front and even the centrist
government of Alvaro Colom in Guatemala, a member of the Venezuelan-led
Petrocaribe regional cooperation programme.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Of those target countries in South and Central America, Venezuela,
Ecuador and Nicaragua are all members of the ALBA economic and
development cooperation community. The ALBA countries have made
dramatic improvements in terms of capital investment, current account
liquidity and social improvements. Nicaragua and Bolivia have
eradicated illiteracy in just three years. Throughout the ALBA bloc,
greater access to better health care has been prioritised
successfully.(4)&nbsp; ALBA's associated, less comprehensive,
Petrocaribe (5) framework provides increased energy security and food
security to around 90 million people in over 17 countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
ALBA's fundamental principles of solidarity and complementarity and the
absence of conditionality have resulted in very significant economic
and social gains for the bloc's member countries. For example,
Nicaragua's trade with Venezuela &#8211; mostly in agricultural produce -
reached over US$110 million in 2009 and is expected to double in 2010.
ALBA countries have supplemented relatively modest capital investment
from traditional partners in North America, Japan and Europe, with
funding from Brazil, China, Russia and India as well as partners like
Vietnam and Iran. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
For the US and its allies among the Western Bloc countries, the
expansion and success of ALBA and Petrocaribe represent two undesirable
trends. Political and economic elites in North America and Europe fear
and resent the relative decline in their regional influence as Latin
America &#8211; with ALBA leading the way &#8211; develops broader and deeper
relations with Western Bloc rivals like China, Russia and Iran. They
also fear regional moves towards integration which in practice permit
the combination and consolidation of economic and political power by
relatively small countries, previously easy to dominate in isolation,
but now, united, more ready and able to resist Western Bloc
rich-country coercion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So in Central America, the US is applying heavy pressure on El
Salvador's social democrat President Mauricio Funes who has responded
by insisting El Salvador will not join ALBA. Regardless, the FMLN
revolutionary political party, with which Funes came to power, is
integrating its municipal authorities into ALBA's programmes. Under US
government pressure, Honduras will most likely withdraw from ALBA,
despite being unable to afford the dramatic drop in economic resources
that move would bring. As part of its anti-ALBA offensive, the US
government is readying its regional resources for the Presidential
elections scheduled in the region over the next two years&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
In 2010, presidential elections take place in Costa Rica (February),
Colombia (May), Suriname (July) and Brazil (October). In 2011,
presidential elections will be held in Haiti (February), Peru (April),
Guatemala (August) and Guyana (August), Argentina (October) and
Nicaragua (November). The current escalation of US military presence in
Colombia and of provocative Colombian military activity along the
Venezuelan border is certainly geared towards creating a climate
of&nbsp; fear and uncertainty in Latin America and the Caribbean so as
to foment unwillingness to cooperate with regional integration
initiatives like ALBA.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The obvious beneficiaries of that fear-campaign, demonizing in
particular Hugo Chavez and Venezuela's Bolivarian revolution, will be
right wing candidates like Laura Chinchilla, the Oscar Arias-clone
likely to win the presidential election in Costa Rica and, in Colombia,
whoever gets anointed&nbsp; to follow Alvaro Uribe. Uribe may even
decide to run for a third presidential term. The elections are
obviously crucial battlegrounds for the US government and for Latin
American governments &#8211; like those of the ALBA countries - and
movements, that resist predatory US government policies favouring
greedy, corrupt local corporate client elites.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Western Bloc propaganda &#8211; the three big lies<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Elections in the region occur within the much broader propaganda and
perception management theatre of the US government's war against Latin
America's impoverished majorities. As in any propaganda war, the main
themes are very few and are repeated endlessly, regardless of contrary
facts. Those main themes are adapted to fit the requirements needed to
render plausible US government aggression against countries that resist
regional policy in Latin America of the US and its allies. They are:
      <ul>
        <li>the US government and its allies promote democracy, stability and economic prosperity</li>
        <li>the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; requires significant US military presence and large amounts of US aid;</li>
        <li>conversely, the governments of President Hugo Chavez in
Venezuela and of other ALBA bloc countries destabilize the region, are
undemocratic, incompetent, corrupt and involved in narcotics and/or
terrorism.</li>
      </ul>
These absurd propaganda claims are entirely counterfactual. As in all
the most effective propaganda, they are very simple lies, frequently
and incessantly repeated via every possible medium. Even a cursory look
at the reality of US regional policy in Latin America reveals how
throughly mendacious this propaganda really is.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The main US allies in the region are Colombia, Mexico and Perú.
Colombia's government is deeply implicated in both narcotics and in
paramilitary mass-murder. Dozens of Alvaro Uribe's colleagues are
either in jail or facing indictment as the Colombian State struggles to
maintain at least the façade of legitimacy. Colombia's human rights
record is among the worst in the world. Paramilitary leaders have
openly boasted they have bought over 30% of the deputies in the
Colombian legislature. Colombia has over 4 million displaced people,
mostly rural families driven from their homes by brutal paramilitary
and army campaigns as a result of Colombia's fifty-year-old civil war.
Despite being fabulously wealthy in terms of natural resources,
Colombia sits over 20 places below Cuba in the United Nations Human
Development Index.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mexico's crisis of governance amidst economic chaos and out-of-control
narcotics activity deepens month by month. President Felipe Calderon
took power via blatant electoral fraud in a political system
universally regarded as hopelessly corrupt. Serious human rights abuses
occur incessantly throughout the country. Mexico, for all its oil
wealth, cannot even provide food security to its people. After well
over a decade of membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
Mexico ranks below Cuba &#8211; victim of 50 years of US economic blockade -
in the United Nations Human Development Index.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Peru's President Alan Garcia is another notoriously corrupt leader with
questionable legitimacy. The recent massacre of indigenous people
during environmental protests at Bagua recalled Garcia's responsibility
for massacres of political prisoners in the 1980s. The Peruvian
government deliberately and flagrantly persecutes political opponents,
environmental activists and trades unionists. Despite excellent
macro-economic numbers, Peru sits 20 places below Cuba in the UN Human
Development Index, right down there with Colombia.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
So the fundamental propaganda motif - that the US promotes democracy,
stability and prosperity in the region - is a complete and blatant lie.
If one turns to the narcotics motif, Colombia, Mexico and Peru all have
intractable problems with narcotics despite working intimately with the
US government agencies charged with combating narcotics production and
trafficking. Two countries in the region have greatly improved their
record on narcotics interception with negligible or zero help from US
government agencies &#8211; Nicaragua and Venezuela. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The third propaganda lie is an obvious corollary of first two. Namely,
any government or movement opposing the US government in Latin America
must be anti-democratic, corrupt and incompetent and involved in
narcotics. The facts very obviously and very clearly contradict US
government propaganda. Even so, international corporate media
religiously and cynically repeat the main US government propaganda
motifs on a daily basis. One deceitful constant propaganda motif
deployed to demonize ALBA country governments is to accuse them of
being accomplices or allies of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces
(FARC) guerrilla movement. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
In fact, both President Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro have several times
called on the FARC leadership to abandon armed struggle. All the main
ALBA country governments have made pronouncements calling for a
negotiated peace to end Colombia's devastating civil war. However,
unconditional US support for the narco-terror government of President
Alvaro Uribe has made a peaceful settlement in Colombia's civil war
impossible. That further example of US destabilization in Latin America
is totally submerged in the saturation calumny by mainstream
international corporate media of ALBA country leaders like Hugo Chavez,
Evo Morales, Daniel Ortega and Rafael Correa.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
News and intellectual betrayal<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Within that regional political and economic context, the role of the
intellectual managerial class that dominates information and news media
in general has become increasingly confused. Many self-styled
progressive people who believed moderate reform, largely accepting
existing international political and economic structures, would bring
much greater stability and prosperity, have been proved hopelessly
wrong. Many such pseudo-progressives - obvious examples are Nicaragua's
Sergio Ramirez and El Salvador's Joaquin Villalobos - opted for
partnership with dominant local elites and now find themselves
identified with those elite's perennial patron &#8211; the United States
government. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The elites find their political power diminishing but use their class
control of local media and their identification with US government
policies to dominate media and cultural space both nationally and
internationally. Technological change has dramatically transformed the
possibilities of information management over the last century. Mass
indoctrination and thought control, the shaping of habits of mind on a
massive scale, have in practice advanced far beyond the primitive
dystopian fantasies of writers like George Orwell in &#8220;1984&#8221; or Aldous
Huxley in &#8220;Brave New World&#8221;. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
As the global reach of media corporations has increased, control of
information channels has become tighter and more concentrated. News has
become almost&nbsp; indistinguishable from entertainment and is treated
with similar criteria of what will sell, what people &#8211; especially
relatively powerful people - will like. In the Western Bloc countries
of North America, Europe and their Pacific allies, almost all general
international news is provided by a few agencies - like Reuters,
Associated Press, Agence France Press or&nbsp; Spain's EFE. Competing
input from non-Western Bloc news agencies &#8211; similar to their Western
Bloc counterparts - like China's Xinhua or Russia's Novosti, let alone
the excellent information available from Cuba's Prensa Latina, or
Venezuela's ABN, almost never figure in reporting on Latin America by
the main Western Bloc media.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some traditional roles have adapted and evolved along with the new
modalities of communication and information made possible by new
technology. Anonymous, skewed corporate news agency reports are often
reinforced by academic, media and cultural stars. Respected, familiar
and well-liked interviewers and newscasters can influence opinion
through their demeanour and attitudes in their handling of news as
decisively as any material fact. News and information have become more
than ever functions of marketing and the ability to form and sustain
endless feedback loops defined by consumer taste.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Julien Benda, the writer who most famously used the phrase &#8220;le trahison
des clercs&#8221; (the treason of the intellectuals), originally did so to
criticize the involvement of writers and artists in politics. But as
George Orwell pointed out, &#8220;The opinion that art should have nothing to
do with politics is itself a political attitude.&#8221; And one finds, among
writers who sympathised with Julien Benda, individuals like T.S.Eliot
whose virulent anti-communism&nbsp; belied his high-minded aspirations.
(It makes sense in retrospect that pseudo-progressive writers like
Ernesto Cardenal &#8211; now a fierce critic of the FSLN in Nicaragua -
should have been heavily influenced by writers like T.S.Eliot.) <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another sympathiser with Julien Benda's &#8220;trahison des clercs&#8221; motif,
Ortega y Gasset, philosopher and educator - Republican civil governor
of Madrid in 1936 when the civil war broke out - warned in his essay
&#8220;The Revolt of the Masses&#8221;, &#8220;Barbarism is the absence of standards to
which appeal can be made.&#8221; But what kind of standards is Ortega y
Gasset talking about? The obvious question begged is that of the moral
philosopher Alastair MacIntyre in the title of his book &#8220;Whose Justice?
Whose Rationality?&#8221; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Varieties of intellectual betrayal<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Almost no one now expects writers and cultural figures to stay aloof
from politics. Open letters, manifestos and appeals from academics and
writers are a common feature of contemporary political life, debate and
propaganda, both nationally and internationally. Other much more
practical varieties of intellectual betrayal than the idealistic
variety identified by Julien Benda characterize debate and argument
about contemporary affairs. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The most basic betrayal is to actively lie about events or deliberately
misrepresent them by omitting readily available, relevant information.
That kind of betrayal is most relevant to academics, who are generally
subject to rigorous peer review. News reporters and their editors and
publishers may once have aspired to similar high standards of appeal. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Such standards, if they ever existed in practice, have long ago been
abandoned. Corporate mergers and acquisitions have concentrated media
and Press ownership in a reactionary elite characterized by extremely
ruthless solidarity against perceived enemies and critics. The news
agencies' quasi-monopoly of news information combined with
consolidation of corporate media ownership has effectively eliminated
independent news media in most Western Bloc countries.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Even in the alternative media that proliferate on the Internet, other
less obvious elements also affect the kinds of news and opinion that
gets published. Class-attitudes and funding considerations definitely
affect the news and views that appear. So, for example, if powerful
individuals in the neocolonialist Left in Western Bloc countries
decide, for example, to publish glib, mendacious attacks on Nicaragua's
Sandinista government, then the alternative media they control will do
so. Subsequently, they will omit to publish efforts to correct the
falsehoods they have propagated. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Supposedly alternative media, like Counterpunch and ZNet, have done
exactly that over the last year or so. The class attitudes fomenting
this kind of behaviour turn on who is friends with who, the
intellectual managerial networks concerned and, crucially, funding. For
most alternative media, as much as for the corporate media, editorial
policy is decisively defined by marketing and consumer taste rather
than by standards to which one might appeal, as envisaged by Ortega y
Gasset.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In practice, many, maybe most, alternative media that depend heavily on
donations or subscriptions serve as a kind of &#8220;loyal media opposition&#8221;
validating the status quo. They appear to offer a rigorous, falsifiable
standard to which appeal might be made. But often that standard is so
heavily rigged as to fall clumsily into Ortega y Gasset's definition of
barbarism.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For the intellectual managerial classes who dominate progressive or
pseudo-progressive information media, editorial judgments are
frequently made in relation to human rights or environmental criteria.
As often as not, these criteria are deployed as pretexts so as not to
have to make political identifications which might either jeopardize
funding or perhaps other politically motivated repression of one kind
or another. Ill-considered political loyalties can easily be dressed up
in human rights criteria so as to justify narcissistic, elitist
prejudice.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The case of Nicaragua<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the wider Latin American regional context two or three simple lies,
constantly repeated, serve to generate an incessant flow of false news
reporting and hopelessly inaccurate opinion pieces. The same is true,
more specifically, in the case of individual countries. In the case of
Nicaragua, two main lies are recycled in both the corporate mainstream
media and in Western Bloc neocolonial Left alternative media. They are
that President Daniel Ortega rules via a dictatorial, corrupt family
clique and that Ortega's government systematically represses civil and
political rights. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
All the other false allegations propagated in the international
corporate and alternative media against the Nicaraguan government
follow from those two big lies. A more specific falsehood, broadcast
ever since November 2008, has been that Daniel Ortega's FSLN government
stole Nicaragua's municipal elections that month. Prior to that
particular falsehood, the ground had been well prepared by foreign news
media, Western Bloc non-governmental agencies, prominent intellectuals
and, needless to say, Western Bloc governments like those of the United
States and the European Union. Sweden's former ambassador to Nicaragua,
Eva Zetterberg, for example, was a shameless and zealous detractor of
the FSLN government prior to her departure. <br>
      <br>
In fact, the FSLN's unprecedented success in those municipal elections
was due firstly, to their record of good government at national and
municipal level and, secondly, to a vicious power struggle within the
opposition Liberal Alliance. None of that reality appeared in most
published comment on Nicaragua's municipal elections. Lie was piled
upon lie, systematically omitting inconvenient facts. The instigators
of the incessant falsehoods were leading supporters and members of the
Nicaraguan opposition, including intellectuals and writers like Dora
Maria Tellez, Ernesto Cardenal, Sergio Ramirez and Gioconda Belli &#8211; all
talented people who decided to promote downright falsehoods for their
own political purposes.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One falsehood they put about was that President Daniel Ortega shut down
two political parties, including their own, the MRS. But in fact it was
the opposition Liberal Alliance politician Wilfredo Navarro, not
Ortega, who instigated the administrative procedure that removed legal
personality from the two political parties concerned. Leaders of the
MRS subsequently supported the Liberal Alliance municipal election
campaign. The allegation against Daniel Ortega was a fabrication
intended to cover up a squalid manoeuvre clearing the way for an
undivided opposition vote, while unjustly smearing the FSLN government
at the same time.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another falsehood the Nicaraguan opposition promoted was that Daniel
Ortega arbitrarily set about repressing local non-profits. The much
criticised but administratively routine periodic review by Nicaragua's
Ministry of Government of the status of the country's 4200+ non
profits, lead to just one attempt at prosecution, against the CINCO
non-profit organization run by oligarch-journalist Carlos Fernando
Chamorro. The investigation was reported to have discovered that CINCO
had received about US$70,000 from a Western Bloc aid agency, OXFAM,
that it passed on to a member organization of the opposition MRS
political alliance, the Autonomous Women's Movement (MAM), run by Sofia
Montenegro, a CINCO board member. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The public prosecutor's office dismissed criminal charges against CINCO
for lack of evidence, but noted, according to Minister of Government
Ana Isabel Morales, that CINCO had channeled other donated aid funds
through five private companies owned by relatives of Carlos Fernando
Chamorro, whose family dominates Nicaragua's corporate media.
Absolutely none of this crucial background information ever appeared in
either the mainstream international corporate media or in the
neocolonial Left alternative media to correct their false allegations
of arbitrary government repression in Nicaragua. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;Just like their corporate media counterparts, alternative news
and information outlets published vicious attacks on the FSLN
government and then omitted to publish replies containing information
discrediting the original falsehoods. In Nicaragua now, the Movimiento
Renovador Sandinista political bloc that has promoted all these
falsehoods enjoys around 2% support nationally according to a recent
poll partially published by Carlos Fernando Chamorro in his
Confidencial web site. That level of domestic support is what one might
reasonably expect for a minority elite political grouping closely
linked to the country's oligarchy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;The apparently innovative intellectual managerial media process
that one sees at work in all the ALBA countries is an infinite feedback
disinformation loop. Fake news is fabricated by unrepresentative
political cliques and individuals like Carlos Fernando Chamorro and his
family, who control major news media in Nicaragua. That fake news is
then taken up and distributed by the international corporate media. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;The international distribution networks eventually recycle the
fake news concoction back to the country it came from and thus
reinforce the original fabrication. Neocolonial Left alternative media
not infrequently collaborate in that process as was clear in the
immediate aftermath of the Honduran military coup. The totally false
description of Manuel Zelaya as a leftist populist trying to fix his
re-election was almost ubiquitous.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;A regional focus<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;The vanity and dishonesty of the intellectual managerial class
who have distorted and suppressed the truth about political and
economic affairs in Nicaragua and elsewhere is common in relation to
all the ALBA countries targeted by the US government and its allies.
The same dishonest and inaccurate reporting and unwillingness to
acknowledge US government cynicism and duplicity characterized both
mainstream and much alternative media reporting of the coup in
Honduras. It took many weeks&nbsp; before either the massive human
rights abuses committed by the Honduran coup regime, let alone the
self-evident connivance of the US government in ensuring that regime's
survival, became widely acknowledged.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;One has come to expect routine downright deceit and distortion
from the international corporate mainstream media - for example from
CNN or the BBC, from El País, Le Monde, the Guardian, the New York
Times and the Washington Post. Nor should the timidity and
prevarication of the Western Bloc intellectual managerial class faced
with the coup in Honduras surprise anyone familiar with that class of
people's misguided support for the deceitful critics of the FSLN
government in Nicaragua. Now, as the US government and its Colombian
narco-terror allies are setting up the conditions for a serious
military provocation against Venezuela, that same intellectual
managerial class will very likely again fail to report the facts in a
timely, trustworthy, challenging way.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;The very same corrupt cynical plutocrat elite that has betrayed
the majority of the US people into economic hardship for years to come,
now seeks to engineer a foreign policy betrayal dragging the United
States into sponsoring disastrous military conflict in Latin America
whose outcome no one can foresee. Virtually no one among the Western
Bloc intellectual managerial class seems to be alert to that
catastrophic development. The mainstream corporate media report
increasing Venezuelan militarism - the reverse of the truth, as usual.
In the alternative information media,&nbsp; leading figures dismiss
pending military conflict, despite forceful expressions of concern by
the governments under threat.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;The negative effects of the coup in Honduras on US prestige in
Latin America will fade away as nothing in comparison with reaction to
US militarist aggression against Venezuela. But corporate imperatives
and geopolitical gangster logic are likely to prevail. Regional
military aggression by the US government and its allies against the
ALBA countries seems inevitable. The US and its allied governments in
Colombia, Mexico and Perú are, to varying degrees, in crisis. By
contrast the ALBA countries have seen off the worst of the
international economic crisis and are growing stronger and more
confident with every year that passes. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;That reality and its wider context have gone effectively
unreported in almost all recent writing on Latin America. The perennial
campaign of calumny against Cuba continues unmitigated. The corporate
media are waiting for orders to open up a new propaganda barrage
against Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, against the FSLN government in
Nicaragua and the governing FMLN party in El Salvador. The alternative
media seem more and more to take their lead from the corporate media
agenda, reacting late in the day in an often ambivalent way. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;In retrospect, one of the most important ALBA-related initiatives
has been the establishment of the communcations and media company
Telesur. The coup in Honduras demonstrated Telesur's value beyond any
doubt. Through July 2009, it was virtually the only news media giving
something like a full account of the brutality and illegitimacy of the
Honduran military coup. That experience categorically vindicated
Telesur's founders. They recognized many years ago that only a regional
media initiative run by local managers loyal to their own peoples would
ever give a true and fair view of events in Latin America.<br>
