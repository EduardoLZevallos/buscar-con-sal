Sandino. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">We want to express our gratitude for the solidarity, the affection, the permanent work you have been doing for so many years to inform, clarify and defend the Sandinista Popular Revolution. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">You have remained firm and tireless, accompanying the Nicaraguan people and the revolutions and progressive forces in the world, despite the systematic media campaigns to discredit our people focused, anti-imperialist process, trying to minimize and discredit the enormous and significant advances that the Revolution has achieved in favor of the humble, working people of Nicaragua. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">We are participating in this event, receiving your tokens of Solidarity with the People of Nicaragua, but we are also here to express our unwavering Solidarity with all Peoples who today are fighting for their Freedom, Sovereignty and Self-determination. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">A People that has experienced intervention by US imperialism so many times and in different ways is very familiar with Struggles and Victories. We are a People from whose breast emerged a Latin American and Caribbean Hero like Augusto C. Sandino who confronted, defeated and expelled the invading Yankees from our lands, and whose example has been inherited by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, indeed does know about Struggles and Victories.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">The FSLN continues Sandino's anti-imperialist struggle, leading the Nicaraguan people to the beautiful Victory of the Sandinista Popular Revolution in July 1979, which many of you may remember, playing an important role in its defense in the 80s. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Precisely because of the popular, anti-imperialist character of our Revolution, the empire quickly unleashed a counterrevolutionary war, which destroyed the country in the 1980s, causing more than 50 thousand deaths. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Many of you also remember another form of Yankee intervention in our land, the imperialist blackmail which brought darkness and ruin to the country in the 1990s and early 2000s, until the Sandinista Front returned to government in 2007, initiating a new stage of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, marked by the Light of Hope for Peace, Reconciliation, Progress and the Well-being of the Nicaraguan People. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Under the banners of the Sandinista Front, led by our Comandante Daniel Ortega and our Compañera Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua quickly took the path of social justice, the restitution of rights, welfare and peace. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Nicaragua demonstrated that a Popular Revolution is capable of improving the lives of its people and promoting development, restoring rights taken away by the empire, by the oligarchy and its neoliberal model, while remaining firm and loyal to the Sandinista Revolutionary political thought from which it arises. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">The fight against poverty is the central element of our National Human Development Plan, our Plan to Fight Poverty, which firmly upholds free health and education as fundamental rights. Access to basic services such as water, electricity, roads, hospitals, clinics and schools began to reach the most distant communities, uniting the country. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">To give you an approximate idea, in 2006 there were 33 Hospitals, in 2025 we have 77; in 2006 there were 940 Health Posts; in 2025 we had 1,432; there were only 20 Maternity Homes, today we have 178 throughout the country. School enrollment went from 1.6 million students to more than 1.8 million; from 0 food in schools to 1 million 200 thousand School Meal rations; from 0 support to families to 1 million scholastic packs for students, 60 thousand briefcases for teachers; from 27 thousand dilapidated classrooms to more than 36 thousand new and rehabilitated classrooms. Let's note, in January 2007, there was a 23% illiteracy rate in Nicaragua. Since 2009, Nicaragua has been declared Free of Illiteracy. And the list goes on Compañeras and Compañeros and that list will increase progressively.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">We have had great advances in the energy sector, achieving more than 99% of national electricity coverage. We are the safest country in Central America, and among the safest in Latin America and the Caribbean. We are among the first in the world in gender equality. We are a country with Macroeconomic Stability. In terms of food sovereignty, we are the only country in Central America that produces approximately 90% of the food it consumes.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">The successful leadership of the Sandinista Front was recognized by our People in the national, municipal and regional elections of 2016 and 2017, so much so that the empire, together with the disloyal sons and daughters of Nicaragua, the same old traitors, the same old oligarchs, could not hide their fear at so many advances, such that they colluded to facilitate a new form of Yankee intervention in 2018, with the purpose of destroying this beautiful new page in the history of our People and trying to fulfill their central objective of destroying the Sandinista Front and, as they said at the time "to physically eliminate the Sandinistas." </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">They funded, intervened, lied and manipulated via the media and social networks, committing atrocities and murders against the peaceful Nicaraguan people in an attempt to dismantle the Revolution through a coup d'état, which failed due to the firmness of our People, of Nicaragua’s workers, who faced this new form of Yankee intervention and its oligarch allies, defeating them once again. </span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Once the coup attempt was defeated, we set out to deepen the conquests achieved and defended by the People, strengthening the defense of the Revolution so that the imperialist and oligarch coup attempts could never again even peek through a small crack in history. We set out to defend and consolidate the Revolution and we continue to do so.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">In these seven years after the coup attempt of 2018, we have increased our productive capacity and the country's income, we have built more hospitals, more schools, more roads. Every day we provide and bring more basic services to more communities. We have increased our food security based on the commitment and enormous productive capacity of our rural producers. We have strengthened our security measures and we remain the safest country in the region.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">This year we reformed the Constitution to strengthen our model of popular democracy and the role of the People as the leader of the revolutionary process. To do this, we are reorganizing our public institutions in a clearer and more coherent way so as to better serve our People, allowing greater economic growth, greater security and social stability, as well as the permanent restitution of the rights of Nicaragua’s families.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">The People of Nicaragua remain committed to continue strengthening the Sandinista Popular Revolution, moreover, in this world stalked, threatened and attacked by the darkest forces in history, installed in the neoliberal governments of the global north, who seek to impose their unipolar hegemonic model and their vicious ideology to try and stop the sovereign advances of Free Peoples like Nicaragua.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">This very dangerous world is characterized by the emergence of the vilest forms of capitalist exploitation. A neo-fascist ideology that does not respect rights, treaties or agreements when it comes to unleashing its destruction on Peoples and the planet or imposing its way of thinking in the name of exploitation, profit and greed.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">We are going through difficult times in the world, times of profound transformations and great challenges, but also times of great clarity about the need to continue working towards a Multipolar World that is emerging before our eyes, in the struggle against unilateralism and imperial hegemonism.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">A Multipolar World that promotes unity, dialogue, mutual understanding, greater solidarity and mutually beneficial cooperation is necessary for Peace, Well-being and Justice. A Multipolar Order alien to hegemony and unilateralism, free of Neocolonial, Imperial and Fascist impositions, one in which we can deepen harmonious bonds of friendship, with respect for the Sovereignty, Independence, Self-Determination and Dignity of the Peoples of the World.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">In these times of confusion and manipulation, it is imperative to reiterate the principle that Latin America and the Caribbean, the Caribbean Sea, is a Zone of Peace and that no power has the right to undermine, intervene, destabilize or attack it in order to overthrow popular and revolutionary democratic governments such as Venezuela, Cuba and other fraternal countries.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">You who "live in the bowels of the monster,” as José Martí characterized it, have to endure the terrible economic, political, cultural and security consequences of the prevailing neo-fascist and neoliberal thinking. We express our respect to you, who remain firm, strong and determined to continue fighting, from within, for your own rights and for the rights of the Peoples of the World.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">This Sandinista Revolution has its maximum expression of sacrifice in our Heroes and Martyrs, among whom we have, with special recognition and love, Brothers and Sisters who came from far away in terms of distance, but very close in terms of shared thought, and who gave their lives for social justice in our country.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Today and every day we recognize the work they do for peace in the world. Many of you have lived among our People and others have visited our country driven by the idea of building a more just world.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">In this second stage of the Sandinista Popular Revolution, the enemies of Justice, Truth and the Rights of the People are the same as in the past and we must know how to identify and seek our revolutionary and progressive north, in the midst of the tide of falsehoods and distortions of the True Truth.</span></span></strong></p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US" style="text-align:left" xml:lang="en-US"><strong><span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span style="font-weight:normal">Our history is clearly divided between Popular Movement and Oligarchic Thought. The decision is clear between oligarchic, elitist, privileged and racist thinking, willing to do everything to maintain their power and privileges, including being enablers of foreign intervention; and the Popular Movement that inherits the best of the history of struggle of our People. There are no half measures. In Nicaragua we are a Popular Movement expressed in the Sandinista Popular Revolution.</span></span></strong></p>
