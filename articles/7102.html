<p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.65s; transition-delay: 0.333333s; animation-duration: 0.65s;"><a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/bitacora/node/6971"><strong>Co-Presidents Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo: Nicaraguan Statement on the Persecution of Migrants in the US</strong></a><strong> </strong>Separating Fathers and Mothers from their Children has always been a reprehensible and condemnable practice. The Bolivarian Government of Venezuela and its President [Maduro] have denounced, and continue to denounce, the evil persecution unleashed on Migrants, honest workers of so many nationalities, who have arrived in the US encouraged by that country’s own propaganda, and driven by the poverty imposed on all our rich and Sacred Territories from which the US has extracted the very best…. We fully agree, and absolutely support, the Just Condemnation and Demand by President [Maduro], for an end to the kidnappings of Migrants.</p>

<p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.65s; transition-delay: 0.345238s; animation-duration: 0.65s;"><a href="https://www.jhc-cdca.org/blog/the-penalty-for-doing-it-right"><strong>The Penalty for Doing It Right…</strong></a><strong> </strong>Contrary to what is said by the US State Department, but is globally recognized, Nicaragua is steadily improving economically even while poor. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assures that there are notable improvements allowing Nicaragua to manage the return of its nationals. It also maintains that the country “has made significant progress in its recovery with the help of the international community.” DHS says that Nicaragua is now a leading country in growth in tourism, ecotourism, agriculture, and renewable energy; it has projects that have improved land administration and management. It has investment projects that have contributed to housing, food security, and the restoration of the health sector. These very positive attributes are now being used by DHS as a justification for revoking Temporary Protection Status for thousands of Nicaraguans in the US, along with Hondurans, granted after the impact of Hurricane Mitch in 1998.</p>

<p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.65s; transition-delay: 0.357143s; animation-duration: 0.65s;"><a href="https://www.tortillaconsal.com/bitacora/node/6974"><strong>Nicaragua Speech in Algeria in Forum on the Crimes of Colonialism</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Johnny Hodgson, Representative to the National Assembly for the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region of Nicaragua)<strong> </strong>We “denounce the incalculable crimes of colonialism and imperialism—rapacious and extractive systems that have exposed and continue to expose entire civilizations to genocide, cultural extermination, slavery, abject poverty, and underdevelopment. The Nicaraguan people, lovers of freedom and defenders of peace, cannot turn a blind eye when speaking of the deep scars that colonialism has left on the soul of our nations. We speak of systematic genocides and decimated populations. We speak of cultural extermination where languages were banned, beliefs persecuted, and ancestral traditions ridiculed or eradicated—all in the name of a supposed “civilization” that, in reality, was barbarism disguised as progress. We also speak of slavery, that indelible stain on human history, which tore millions from their homes, chained them, and subjected them to lives of torture and servitude to fill the coffers of colonial empires.</p>

<p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.65s; transition-delay: 0.369048s; animation-duration: 0.65s;">“The Algerian people, under French colonial rule for more than 130 years, waged an unrelenting war of liberation, becoming an inexhaustible source of inspiration for revolutionary movements worldwide, particularly for the Sandinista National Liberation Front and the Nicaraguan people…The victory of the Algerian Revolution was not just that of a people against an empire; it was the affirmation that dignity and self-determination are non-negotiable, that the will of a free people is invincible. The brutality of French repression, which claimed more than 1.5 million innocent lives, fueled the flames of resistance…</p>

<p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.65s; transition-delay: 0.380952s; animation-duration: 0.65s;">The decolonization process, driven by the courage of Peoples like the Algerian, has been a monumental advance in human history. This blow to colonial empires marked the beginning of a new era—an era in which millions of human beings saw their national dignity restored and conquered the sovereign and inalienable right of every people to decide their destiny in peace, freedom, and free from threats and aggressions.”</p>

But the media here flatters itself by portraying machismo as a particularly Latin American malady, all the while overlooking significant feminist gains made in the region. Feminists celebrated Claudia Sheinbaum’s electoral victory in June 2024, making her the first female to accede to the presidency in Mexico. Her main challenger was also female.</p>

<p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.65s; transition-delay: 0.416667s; animation-duration: 0.65s;">A number of other countries there have established “gender quotas” in electoral lists. The gender quota is 50% in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Panama, and Venezuela. Honduras, El Salvador, Haiti, and Paraguay have lesser quotas. However, lax enforcement and loopholes to circumvent them continue. Cuba has a strong commitment to equity, where its Communist Party promotes women, youth, and racial minorities. Fully 56% of its national assembly is composed of women.</p>

<p class="preFade fadeIn" style="white-space: pre-wrap; transition-timing-function: ease; transition-duration: 0.65s; transition-delay: 0.428571s; animation-duration: 0.65s;">Nicaragua may be one of the region’s smallest nations and came just 19th out of 23 Latin American countries in a recent “prosperity” ranking, but it is one of the leaders in establishing the role of women in public life. Last year the World Economic Forum ranked it sixth in its global index for closing the gender gap... Over 23,400 small businesses have been formalized in 15 years, the majority owned by women; over 500 new women’s cooperatives have been formed. The “Zero Hunger” program has significantly improved women’s earnings. <strong> </strong>The feminist movement, mobilized mainly through the Sandinista National Liberation Front, is a class-based feminism that fights not only against patriarchy but also for an anti-imperialist and socialist class consciousness.</p>
