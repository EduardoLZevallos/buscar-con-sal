      <br>
The economic and political power of Western Bloc countries &#8211; the USA,
Canada, the leading European countries and their Pacific allies &#8211; is
rooted in the economic and military advantage they seized in the
centuries of colonial expansion. They have defended that advantage and
propagated it ruthlessly ever since. After the Second World War, they
reorganized the colonial system under the leadership of the United
States.<br>
      <br>
That reorganization set out to defend liberal corporate capitalism
against perceived threats from communist countries like the Soviet
Union and China and from anti-colonialist nationalism in Africa, Asia
and Latin America. Economic and political power enabled Western Bloc
countries to impose their cultural and moral agenda around the world.
That domination, self-evidently based on military, especially nuclear,
superiority, was accompanied by a bogus claim to moral and intellectual
superiority. <br>
      <br>
The alleged cultural superiority was based mostly on the arguments of
Liberalism, promising progress and prosperity based on electoral
democracy, free markets, individual liberty and the rule of law. Like
any other ideology, Liberalism is as amorphous as the people who
promote it, with many currents. By the 1970s even Conservative
politicians &#8211; people like Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher -
subscribed to the main tenets of Liberalism, both in politics and in
economics. <br>
      <br>
In politics, all versions of Liberalism prioritize change - usually
construed as progress - generated by communities of opinion freely
arguing their respective cases. Liberals expect those communities to
reach consensus through processes based on the free exchange of ideas,
democratic elections and the arbitration of an independent judiciary.
In economics, Liberalism advocates supposedly free markets based on
contracts freely entered into by individuals and businesses, typically
corporations. <br>
      <br>
So-called free trade agreements, or in the case of the European Union,
the mis-named Economic Partnership Agreements, embody economic
liberalism's dominant influence on international trade relations.
Against overwhelming evidence, proponents of Liberalism pretend that,
on the whole, markets, left more or less to themselves, will ensure
optimal and generally just outcomes for everyone. The most aggressive
expression of those Liberal economic principles over the last forty
years has been neoliberalism. <br>
      <br>
But neoliberalism is not just influential in economics, it has pushed
important aspects of Liberal thought back to the extremes that
characterized global economic and political life prior to World War
Two. In some aspects, thanks to the communications revolution, they
have gone even further, typically breaking down economies and markets
via accelerated hyper-connectivity into an infinite proliferation of
contractual transactions. Leading political neoliberal, Margaret
Thatcher, once said, notoriously, &#8220;There is no such thing as society.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
In the United States, Liberalism was strengthened by the persuasive
legacy of Pragmatist philosophers, most cogently John Dewey, whose
views greatly strengthened the influential anti-communism developed by
thinkers like Sidney Hook. That variety of anti-communism influenced
both conservative ex-Trotskyists who eventually aggressively promoted
Reaganite neoliberalism and also more affable, humanitarian varieties
of Liberalism like that expounded, for example, by the philosopher
Richard Rorty. Economic and political variations on the main tenets of
Liberalism abound. <br>
      <br>
Both affinities and differences characterize the ideas of US varieties
of Liberal thinkers when compared to others like the Austrian Friedrich
von Hayek, author of &#8220;the Road to Serfdom&#8221;, Raymond Aron, the French
writer of &#8220;The Opium of the Intellectuals&#8221; or Karl Popper, who wrote
&#8220;The Open Society and its Enemies&#8221; in New Zealand. However, until the
recent economic crisis, regardless of occasional points of coincidence
and divergence, a broad swathe of dominant global Liberal political
opinion tended to promote the utterly tendentious equation &#8220;free
markets = democracy&#8221;. That phony equation's ideological corollary,
particularly relevant to the Western Bloc's cultural war against Islam,
was &#8220;free market democracy = progress/modernity&#8221;.<br>
      <br>
Domestically, after the Liberal propaganda triumph embodied in the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Western Bloc governing elites were still
only able to make that propaganda plausible by promoting
finance-dominated consumerism fueled by ever more frequent asset
bubbles and unsustainable debt. They exploited their economic dominance
of international financial institutions to force poorer countries into
increasingly deeper dependency. By combining frenetic corporate
globalization with the ruthless deployment of military power around the
world, they secured their economic advantage despite a decline in their
productive capacity relative to important rivals like China. <br>
      <br>
Morally and intellectually, Liberalism has exhausted its role as a
cultural alibi for Western Bloc countries' historical crimes of
genocide, slavery and insatiable exploitation. Politically ,
economically, and environmentally, Liberalism has been exposed as
shamelessly fraudulent. Its political system has degenerated to an
endless marketing exercise selling rapacious plutocracy as democracy
via the public relations skills of star players like, until recently,
Tony Blair and, now, Barack Obama.<br>
      <br>
Economically, the Liberal global financial system is built on
neocolonial extortion and systemic fraud, especially via secretive
offshore activities, with occasional show trials to give an impression
of control and accountability. At the end of the 1980s it was Drexel
Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky. In 2002 it was Enron
and WorldCom, Ken Lay and Bernie Ebbers. Now it is Goldman Sachs and
Bernie Madoff. Only the names change, the rotten systemic fraud backed
up internationally by terrifying imperial military muscle remains the
same.<br>
      <br>
Systemic financial fraud is matched by systemic media dishonesty.
Liberal ideological dominance since World War 2 has seen a monopolistic
concentration of powerful media beyond the dreams of any despot in
history. The mass global propaganda potential of these multi-sector
corporate media monsters has generated infinite feedback loops that
render traditional fact-based reporting almost completely
anachronistic. <br>
      <br>
Among many examples of the power of global corporate media are the
erasure of Israel's decades-long genocide of the Palestinian people and
support for criminal aggression against Iraq and&nbsp; Afghanistan.
Military aggression against Iran seems to be only a matter of time. In
Latin America, Western Bloc media demonize the governments of Cuba and
Venezuela whose socialist policies work demonstrably better for the
majority than those of Liberal capitalism in neighbouring countries.<br>
      <br>
Incessant hysterical attacks on political figures like Presidents
Mahmud Ahmadinejad of Iran and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela indicate an
underlying geopolitical reality. Western Bloc governments are reluctant
to confront outright nuclear armed rivals like Russia and China. But
they are ready and willing to openly threaten those global rival's
regional allies like Iran and Venezuela.<br>
      <br>
Latin America<br>
      <br>
Historically, in Latin America as elsewhere, Liberalism represented the
advance of excluded sectors towards political power against
Conservative landowning elites and their allies in the Roman Catholic
Church. But over the last forty years, most Liberal parties in Latin
America have generally succumbed to aggressive neoliberalism and
clearly identify with repressive, avaricious local oligarchies. The
emblematic instance of that reality in recent months has been the
support of the leadership of the Liberal International &#8211; representing
hundreds of Liberal Parties around the world - for the fascist coup
regime in Honduras.<br>
      <br>
In Latin America, neoliberalism blurs into its Liberal origins more
readily perhaps than in North America or in Europe. The neoliberal
economic formula as experienced by Latin America's impoverished
majorities has been persistently and uniformly extremist. Over decades,
the formula hardly ever varied : privatization of public resources,
deregulation of commercial and financial markets, reduction in
government expenditure, free flow of foreign capital and investment. <br>
      <br>
The end result consistently was increased environmental degradation,
inequality and poverty, rural depopulation and migration of labour
abroad. Haiti's catastrophic condition even before this year's
earthquake is only the most extreme example. The situation of
impoverished majorities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean is
often equally dramatic, though perhaps less obvious and certainly less
reported. <br>
      <br>
Long before the recent economic collapse of the Western Bloc countries,
their economic model had demonstrably failed in Latin America, as it
had in the rest of the world. That failure was both theoretical&nbsp; -
an inability to predict outcomes - and practical &#8211; a pathetic failure
to deliver prosperity. The theoretical and practical failure became
clearer than ever when its environmental dimension was exposed at the
global summit in Copenhagen earlier this year.<br>
      <br>
The financial and economic crisis that began in July 2007 has forced
neoliberal ideologues to retreat and make accommodations with less
extreme economic Liberalism, especially with the interventionist
policies most famously advocated by John Maynard Keynes. Even former
bastions of neoliberal dogma like the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund are now reassessing the dismal results of their
ideological faith-based policy failures over the last forty years. This
ideological revaluation represents a dramatic historic reversal of
capitalism's neoliberal remaking of itself following widespread
abandonment of Keynes' ideas in the late 1970s. <br>
      <br>
As the economic writer Henry C.K.Liu wrote in an article on Keynes and
Hayek, by the mid 1970s,&#8220;Conservative politicians began to demonize
Keynesianism domestically and rational socialist economic planning
internationally. Third World socialism, burdened with endemic poverty
from imperialism, was never given a chance economically by the new
financial imperialism and politically by Cold War containment.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
Liu perhaps underestimates the extent to which Liberal-minded
social-democrat chameleons like Bill Clinton, François Mitterand,
Felipe Gonzalez and Tony Blair embraced neoliberalism. They did so
because they totally subscribed to the fundamental tenets of dominant
Liberal ideology. But Liu's remarks hint at the deeper reality of
Liberalism's ideological breakdown. <br>
      <br>
That breakdown happened because Western Bloc political, economic and
intellectual leaders were unable to manage their domestic policy
failures. Internationally, those domestic failures were paralleled by
genocidal military intervention and wholesale abuses in flagrant
violation of agreed humanitarian and human rights standards. Liberal
societies' fundamental contradiction is that their governments depend
on inhuman State violence to enforce compliance and submission to the
dominance accorded, domestically, to inhuman corporate business and
finance interests and, overseas, to predatory national interests.<br>
      <br>
The recent US Supreme Court decision to allow corporations to provide
unlimited funding to political election campaigns demonstrates that
leading Western Bloc countries have learned nothing from the failures
of their financial and economic system. Now they are extending it even
deeper into their own political system too. The trillion dollar bailout
of the US corporate finance sector in effect means that US taxpayers
have bankrolled multinational corporate gamblers who will use their
winnings to buy legislators wholesale, as well as the next US
President, over and over again.<br>
      <br>
In foreign affairs, Liberal political and economic contradictions merge
into moral criminality on a global scale. Ever since 1948, Western Bloc
countries have deliberately sought to exclude the global majority from
any meaningful process to generate equitable global peace and justice.
Imperialist aggression in Korea, through Vietnam and up to the present
in Iraq and Afghanistan was paralleled by murderous colonialist
aggression, for example in Cheju, Madagascar and Algeria, followed
later by a multitude of neocolonial interventions, by the Liberal
West's long covert defense of South African apartheid and its brazen
support for Israel's slow genocide of the Palestinian people. <br>
      <br>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and its
allies have worked rapidly to destroy the foundational consensus
embodied in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN, on
one reading an aspirational embodiment of Liberalism's highest ideals,
has been deliberately wrecked by rich Western Bloc governments
determined to defend their countries' power and privilege. Former UN General
Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto has called urgently for a
re-invention of the UN. The Western Bloc countries' increasingly
reckless international gangsterism is a tacit acknowledgment that their
global dominance is over.<br>
      <br>
In Latin America, the ALBA bloc of countries, committed to their
respective paths towards socialism, are equally determined to defend
their peoples' rights to the fundamental UN principles of
self-determination and freedom from aggression, and to the broadest
possible realization of the rights embodied in the UN Universal
Declaration. As the ALBA countries seek to progress towards those ends,
the Western Bloc response has been one of covert support for domestic
anti-democratic opposition forces, regional and international
saturation media attack, aid and trade coercion and outright militarism.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua &#8211; ALBA in Central America<br>
      <br>
Even more so, following the military coup in Honduras, it is now
Nicaragua whose politics dramatically highlight the failure of Liberal
ideology at national, regional and international levels. Liberalism has
categorically failed both in terms of its theoretical predictive
capacity and in terms of practical delivery of prosperity. By contrast,
the socialist-inspired government programme of the Frente Sandinista de
Liberación Nacional (FSLN) has consistently achieved its broad
objectives. That contrast between abject Liberal failure and undeniable
Sandinista achievement is the cause of the Liberal opposition's
electoral decline since Daniel Ortega became President in 2007.<br>
      <br>
For the moment, Nicaragua's relative economic and social progress does
not reflect too badly on its fellow Central American governments. That
is hardly surprising given the extremely low base bequeathed by
successive neoliberal governments from which the FSLN government began
just three years ago in January 2007. The real test for both Nicaragua
and ALBA is likely to be whether or not the FSLN can successfully win
re-election in 2011 and what the resulting FSLN government will then be
able to achieve in the developing regional context between 2012 and
2018. <br>
      <br>
Conversely, the national and regional centre-right and right-wing
parties &#8211; still obsessed with discredited Liberal political ideology
and neoliberal economic ideas &#8211; are desperate to prevent a Sandinista
electoral win in the 2011 presidential elections. With no plausible
coherent political programme, the Nicaraguan opposition parties
represent in microcosm the failure of their Western Bloc patrons. At a
global level, Western Bloc governments threaten militarist chaos to
defend their countries' power and privilege. In Nicaragua, the local
Liberal opposition sabotage normal institutional life whenever they can.<br>
      <br>
Nicaragua's politics also reflect the gravitational pull of global
Liberalism as it implodes upon itself like a dwarf star, sucking
orbiting political debris into its collapse. In Nicaragua, that debris
includes the motley remnants of the libertarian socialists, anarchists
and social democrats that make up the Movimiento Renovador Sandinista
party and its Rescate appendage. It is no surprise that MRS allies on
the self-regarding, neocolonial Left in North America and Europe have
faithfully repeated US State Department propaganda attacking the FSLN
government led by Daniel Ortega. <br>
      <br>
The FSLN revolutionary government in Nicaragua represents a nemesis for
US regional policy in Central America. It does so because it presents
an even stronger ideological challenge than it did during the
Sandinista Revolution of the 1980s. It is stronger partly because the
US cannot readily deploy State terrorism to blow up schools and
clinics, or murder engineers, teachers and nurses as it did during the
Cold War. The current Sandinista government also represents a stronger
challenge ideologically because, as part of ALBA, it is delivering
economic and social progress that 16 years of neoliberal governments
did not.<br>
      <br>
ALBA &#8211; the Liberal nemesis<br>
      <br>
When Arturo Valenzuela appeared before the US House Foreign Affairs
Sub-Committeee on the Western Hemisphere earlier this year, Senator Dan
Burton remarked, complaining about a matter involving Honduras &#8220;This is
our front yard!&#8221; Comically, Burton blurted out an unconscious
recognition that Central America is no longer as dependent on the US as
it used to be. If Central America is no longer the US backyard that is
mainly thanks to the Venezuelan and Cuban led ALBA economic programme
and its less ambitious subsidiary programme, Petrocaribe.<br>
      <br>
ALBA contradicts Liberal economic thinking in various ways. It promotes
solidarity and complementarity between sovereign nations. Liberal
economic thinking prescribes vigorous competition and the dissolution
of national sovereignty under multilateral global institutions &#8211;
dominated by the United States and its allies. <br>
      <br>
ALBA's policy makers attempt to plan rationally and cooperatively,
removing that role from basket case outfits like the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and their various adjuncts. Liberal
economists tinker faithlessly with ineffectual regulation, hoping some
invisible capitalist hand will make for optimal outcomes that never
ever come about. <br>
      <br>
ALBA deliberately proposes sustainable economic equity for the peoples
of Latin America and the Caribbean. Neoliberals demand a mechanical,
exponential increase in transactional connectivity to the greater glory
of an ineffable market. Western Bloc governments publicly preach
Liberal economic non-intervention at the same time as they covertly
collude as junior partners with their Central banks and major financial
institutions to defend their countries global predominance by fixing
currency, commodity and bond markets. <br>
      <br>
A crucial development in ALBA's planning towards its objectives has
been the introduction of a unified regional compensation system built
around a currency accounting unit &#8211; the Sucre. In effect this
compensation system means that intra-ALBA trade will increasingly and
rapidly abandon the dollar. That effect will amplify the existing use
of barter between the ALBA countries that has already reduced their
need to participate in foreign exchange transactions involving the US
dollar.<br>
      <br>
The establishment of the Sucre is another small blow to US dollar
hegemony. It follows agreements reached in 2009 between Argentina and
Brazil and between Argentina and China to manage most of their
bilateral trade by means of currency swaps which also dramatically
reduce those countries' need to engage in US dollar-based foreign
exchange transactions. These moves amount to a steady strengthening of
sovereign control over Latin America's most important economies and a
corresponding decline in the importance of the US dollar as an
international reserve currency.<br>
      <br>
The introduction of the Sucre follows a similar logic to that of
progressive Liberal economists in the US who argue that the US can run
deficits as high as the economy needs to because its debt is
denominated in its own sovereign currency. But whereas the ALBA
countries are using the Sucre to stabilize and promote intra-regional
trade and productivity, it is far from clear that deficit spending by
the US government will achieve better results than those achieved in
Japan over the last two decades, for example. Nor is it clear how the
US economy might adjust to wholesale abandonment by global purchasers
of US government debt faced with a marked fall in the value of the US
dollar in relation to other leading currencies.<br>
      <br>
ALBA's principal members -
Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela - represent the future
of Latin America &#8211; a socialist future. Politically, most of the ALBA
countries tend to promote socialist, direct participatory democracy and
grass roots organization. Globally and regionally, it may be possible
for Western Bloc governments and their local allies to keep up the
hollow façade of the Liberal capitalist system. But its basis in
militarist gangsterism, elite corruption, inhuman inequality and
rapacious environmental destruction are now clearer than ever for all
to see. <br>

      <br>
ALBA's very success and that of its sister energy and food security
framework Petrocaribe, has provoked a very precarious moment now for
its member countries, under menacing threat from the United States and
its allies. It is a moment when one could legitimately expect global
progressive forces to coalesce in active defense of all the ALBA
governments. But it is not uncommon to find influential figures who
claim to be anti-capitalist or anti-imperialist and yet refuse to
defend explicitly and vigorously the governments of Cuba, Venezuela or
Nicaragua against US and allied aggression in its various forms.<br>
      <br>
The Western Bloc countries and their local allies are maneuvering
fiercely to try and destabilize&nbsp; Nicaragua, perhaps even to make
it impossible to hold elections in 2011. For the foreseeable future,
the US economy will certainly tend to stagnate with unrelenting high
unemployment. The sovereign debt problems of important European Union
countries will also probably deteriorate, deepening&nbsp; economic
failure there too. <br>
      <br>
As those countries fail to resolve their economic and financial crisis,
their menacing pressure on relatively successful ALBA countries will
increase. The socialist oriented ALBA governments face a protracted
attritional confrontation with the failing Western Bloc ancien regime.
In that confrontation, 2011 is likely to prove a decisive year for
ALBA's defense of solidarity and humanity against its enemies.<br>
