Nicaragua talk to Karla Jacobs about how government policies are
affecting youth, May 18th 2011</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Leonor Hern&aacute;ndez,
Coordinator of the of the Sandinista Youth &#8220;Promotor&iacute;a
Solidaria&#8221; (or &#8220;Solidarity Action&#8221;) movement.</span><br>
      <br>
The young people involved in the &#8220;Promotor&iacute;a Solidaria&#8221; are
involved in constant activity, working&nbsp; with Nicaraguan families
as part of an attempt to tap into people's conscience and transform the
model by which we live, so that the lives of all members of our society
can be filled with respect, love, solidarity and union.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
We want every single Nicaraguan family to be able to live in an
environment of peace and harmony. This is the aim towards which we work
as young solidarity volunteers within this process to bring greater
dignity to the lives of Nicaraguan families, a process which involves
us in different ways from the construction of new homes for poor
families, to repair work on school buildings which fell into disrepair
during previous governments.<br>
      <br>
The &#8220;Promotor&iacute;a Solidaria&#8221; is also involved in the daily labour
of caring for street children who find themselves in neglect. We also
take part&nbsp; in the care of children of working mothers who are
looked after in government Child Development Centers (CDIs) or as part
of other government programs. These are children who do not have the
privilege of belonging to an integrated family unit as a result of
various adversities present within our society.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The work carried out by the &#8220;Promotor&iacute;a Solidaria&#8221; is more than
a simple mechanism of support for government programs: It is the means
by which young people are converting themselves into the protagonists
and leaders of this process of bringing people greater dignity.<br>
      <br>
Since 2007 and the FSLN's new electoral triumph, the Sandinista Youth
has undergone a a series of changes and has also experienced
significant growth in terms of its membership in all of the country's
municipalities and departments. Indeed we have grown to such an extent
that we can safely say that the Sandinista Youth is present in all
communities and neighbourboods throughout Nicaragua, because in every
single community and every single neighbourhood there are young people
who take part in the different activities promoted by our various
movements.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Two and half years ago the Sandinista Youth was one homogenous
organization. Today there are many different movements within the
Sandinista Youth each of which represents the different interests of
young people in Nicaragua today. There is a sports movement, a cultural
movement, an environmental movement, there is a network of young social
communicators, there is the &#8220;Promotor&iacute;a Solidaria&#8221; among
others.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
I would say the Sandinista Youth has been successful in creating spaces
that truly represent the different interests and concerns of young
Nicaraguans and, as a result, more and more young people are getting
involved with what we do.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Essentially the purpose of the different aspects of our work as
Sandinista Youth is to contribute to the well-being of young people,
and of society in general. And this is achieved by facilitating
sporting and cultural activities, by developing different skills, and
above all by raising awareness among young people about the importance
of being organized as a means of contributing to our personal
wellbeing, the wellbeing of our neighbourhoods or communities and the
wellbeing of society as a whole.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
This sums up the Sandinista Youth's strategy for growth going ahead
into the future: to continue&nbsp; creating spaces and movements that
represent the interests and ideology of young Nicaraguans who, for so
many years, were neglected by governmental structures.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
And we have a major advantage which is that we don't see ourselves as
forming part of a market in which we are out to buy the loyalty of our
members &#8211; this is what has facilitated our attempts to create
Sandinista Youth presence in neighbourhoods and communities across the
nation.<br>
      <br>
In terms of the participation of young women as part of this process
one can confirm that today, more than ever, more opportunities for
participation and leadership have been opened up to young women &#8211;
spaces that we had earned but that had been denied to us in the past.
Today young women's right to take an active leadership role in this
process has been vindicated. And I think that, in general, the
participation of young women is seen as an integral part of the
development of the country and of society as a whole.<br>
      <br>
Although I would say that we still have a way to go in terms of
achieving the full empowerment of young women &#8211; many young women still
lack confidence that they are fully capable of taking on leadership
roles.<br>
      <br>
But if we compare the situation today with that of our parents, it is
more than obvious that things have changed a lot in this regard. Today
we can say that society in general has reformed its previous perception
that it is the men who should be running the family, the country,
everything.<br>
      <br>
And it is thanks to the hard work carried out by young women that the
spaces we have earned are respected. I do believe that today women are
seen as fundamental agents of development within Nicaraguan society.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A perspective on young people on
the Caribbean Coast</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Danilo Chang Cash, Regional
Coordinator of the Sandinista Youth in the RAAS (Southern Atlantic
Autonomous Region) and founder of the organizations &#8220;Young People
Establishing New Horizons&#8221; (JENH-CEDEHCA) and Caribbean Youth Coalition
(COJUCA).</span><br>
      <br>
Young people on the Caribbean Coast suffer many difficulties in
different aspects of our lives due to diverse factors, for example, the
structural insufficiencies that exist at a local and regional level and
the prominence of drug trafficking in our region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The problems that most affect youth on the Caribbean Coast are a lack
of job opportunities for both skilled and unskilled young workers as
well as a lack of recreational activities like sporting or cultural
activities.<br>
      <br>
These are factors which end up provoking excessive levels of drug and
alcohol consumption among adolescents and young adults in the region.
Many young people have even got caught up with drug trafficking
themselves, some internally, others internationally. And of course they
abandon their education in the process. This situation is of great
concern for the communities of the Caribbean Coast.<br>
      <br>
Another ramification of the lack of job opportunities has been that
many young people have felt obliged to leave the region and travel to
the Pacific side of the country in search of work. Very often, though,
we are victims of racist discrimination in the Pacific part of the
country &#8211; the discrimination we are subjected to comes first and
foremost from the Police but also we are often victims of
discrimination in the work place, at college and sometimes in our
interactions with different State institutions.<br>
      <br>
Another problem that affects the lives of many young people here is the
very high infection rate of sexually transmitted diseases among
adolescents and young adults as well as a very high teenage pregnancy
rate (something which primarily affects young people in rural areas).<br>
      <br>
All these different factors come together within a context of social
decomposition and the loss of the true values and traditions of the
peoples of our region &#8211; a process which is particularly advanced within
afrodescendent communities where many children and adolescents are not
brought up by their parents who have had to emigrated in search of
work, which they often find on tourist ships in Miami or the Grand
Cayman Islands.<br>
      <br>
Since President Daniel Ortega's government came to power we have seen
several changes which have brought positive implications for young
people here on the Caribbean Coast. For example, many more young people
are involved in different government programs &#8211; mainly scholarship
programs &#8211; today than under previous governments. Also many more young
people have been involved in national activities and events in one way
or another.<br>
      <br>
Something very important that the Sandinista government has done is to
foment and promote access to sporting activities with the creation of
baseball and basketball academies in both Autonomous Regions. Also we
have seen numerous infrastructural improvements to sporting facilities
in the different municipalities of the Caribbean Coast.<br>
      <br>
The work carried out in terms of the recovery of the Caribbean Coast's
First League Baseball Team and the inclusion of the team in the
national leagues has been an important source of inspiration for
numerous young players on the Coast.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
I should also mention the important work the government has supported
in terms of recovering and promoting different art forms and other
forms of cultural expression in both regions of the Caribbean Coast.<br>
      <br>
Additionally, this government's Human Development Plan along with the
Strategy for Development on the Caribbean Coast have helped to
strengthen the process of autonomy on the Coast.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The main change in this sense is the new found respect for decisions
made by autonomous institutions at a communal, territorial and regional
level. Today Central Government consults with and respects the
decisions of these authorities regarding projects that are to be
carried out in the Carribean Coast and commercial concessions that
affect the region's resources.<br>
      <br>
This new found respect together with the advances made in terms of the
issuing of land titles for Indigenous and Afrodescendent peoples as
well as the installation of electricity in all communities in both
regions have helped to create a sense of optimism and hope among young
people on the Coast. As a result I would say that young people are
starting to believe in the autonomous process again.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
One thing I think the government should do which would bring great
benefit to young people in our region is to create the necessary
conditions for private investors to invest in Call Centers on the Coast.<br>
      <br>
Young people from the Coast find it easy to get work in Call Centers
thanks to that fact that so many of us are Spanish / English bilingual.
But what this means is that hundreds of young people from the Coast are
migrating to Managua where the Call Centers are located.<br>
      <br>
If the government was able to facilitate the instalation of Call
Centers here on the Coast, it would be a good way of creating job
opportunities for young people in our own region, and of avoiding, as a
result, a situation in which young people feel obliged to abandon their
families, their communities and, most importantly, their education in
order to secure a job.<br>
