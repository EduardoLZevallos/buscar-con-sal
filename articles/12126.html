with journalist Semyon Senderov from the Program "Interview", RT</b></p>

<p><b>29 June, 2021</b></p>

<div class="text-align-center" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" width="458"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="252" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OvcM2HWKnZk" width="448"></iframe></div>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Hello, how about that? Welcome to a new edition of "Interview." Today we are going to talk about Nicaragua, its internal political situation and its relations with other nations, and for this we have an excellent opportunity to talk with the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, Denis Moncada. Minister, thank you very much for accepting our call and being with us now.</p>

<p>Nicaragua lately has been the focus of media attention, it appears practically every day in the headlines of the International News Media. But, before moving on to specific issues, I would like to leave a more open question. For you, what are the priorities of Nicaragua's foreign policy at the moment? What are the challenges?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>We have defined a foreign policy of communication; of strengthening friendship with all the countries, with all the Peoples of the world, with all governments; of strengthening multilateralism; of defending international law, the UN Charter and its fundamental principles, which have to do mainly with non-interference, international peace and security, mutual relations on a level of sovereign equality between States, respect in these relations, of which Nicaragua is very demanding.</p>

<p>We transmit and reaffirm the character of the State of Nicaragua, as a Free, Sovereign, Independent State with Self-Determination, which are also essential elements of international relations and relations with all the countries of the world.</p>

<p>Of course, that foreign policy includes defending the existence of Nicaragua, the Dignity and Sovereignty of the Nicaraguan People, respect for the State, the Government, and our Institutions. Defending Peace, Stability, Security and the realization of internal policies defined by the Government of Reconciliation and Unity National, led by President-Comandante Daniel and Vice President Rosario Murillo.</p>

<p>Among other aspects, elements and priorities that Nicaragua's foreign policy, within all this dynamic, are strengthening foreign investments, international investments in our country, expanding communications, tourism activities, trade, as well as exchanges with other countries.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Minister, focusing a little on the situation within the country, how would you describe the political scenario in Nicaragua at the moment?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>In Nicaragua we have a situation of peace, stability and tranquillity, with the exception of the systematic, obsessive aggressions of the government and the imperial power elites of the United States and its allies, such as the European Union, and other subjects and subordinates of the United States. A policy of aggression in different areas.</p>

<p>As you mentioned, Nicaragua is in the focus of media attention, having a normal, stable situation, and developing in accordance to its institutionality. However, there are countries, including those led by the United States, which seek precisely to obstruct the development of an electoral process that is defined by the Political Constitution and the legal system of Nicaragua and that we develop in a consensual way together with the legally registered political parties.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Therefore, Minister, returning to the subject of the headlines of the international news media, I would like to look at the concern shown by some countries about the recent arrests of some opponents, or journalists, for example, and everything associated with that, which is happening in the context of the elections that Nicaragua is going to have in November of this year. So, I would like to ask, if they are right, or is the situation different?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>No, they are misleading! The truth is that they are using, as always, the media capabilities of the imperial powers to create confusion, to transmit falsehoods, to distort the reality of our country.</p>

<p>Also, the Powers of the State act in a coordinated, but independent way. We are talking about the Office of the Public Prosecutor or the Attorney General, which carry out their activities normally, and having indications of the commission of crimes threatening the security of the people and the stability of the State, making calls and demands for military interference and interventions, with individuals or organizations receiving funding from the imperial powers, the United States and also countries in Europe; the Office of the Public Prosecutor has started to carry out a normal investigation and once it has found probable cause it proceeds with the judicial process in order to guarantee the security and stability of the Country.</p>

<p>An electoral process is taking place simultaneously, and neither of these things are paralyzed,  the Office of the Public Prosecutor is not stopping its investigation, nor is the Supreme Electoral Council of Nicaragua paralyzing the normal electoral process, which is defined by the Constitution and the country's legal system. Both institutions are governed by the rule of law in Nicaragua and follow their standard procedures.</p>

<p>All the activities of harmful and negative propaganda seek precisely to link one situation with the other, when in fact they occur in parallel, because the law establishes the obligation of the Office of the Public Prosecutor to investigate any indication of the commission of a crime, and the Supreme Electoral Council carries out the electoral process in accordance with the Constitution and the Law, as well as in agreement with the political parties that have legal standing in our country.</p>

<p>So, there is talk of arrests, but we must be clear that the people arrested are mostly linked to non-governmental organizations; they are not politicians, they are not registered in political parties, they are not part of any political party, nor are they candidates designated by anyone, by any political-party organization. They are really directors of NGO´s that have received a lot of funding from abroad, several millions of dollars, and they allocate them, they divert them, not for the purposes for which these NGO´s were created, but to destabilize the country.</p>

<p>Therefore, in particular, there is no persecution and there are no judicial proceedings against politicians or candidates, making it clear that the time has not yet come in the Electoral Calendar to define and designate the candidates, the pre-candidates for President, Vice President, Congressmen and Women, as established by the Electoral Calendar, that has already been approved by the Supreme Electoral Council and in conjunction with the political parties duly registered and acting legally within the country.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Minister, I would nevertheless like to follow this a little, because we have noticed certain changes in the media, which were described in a number of newspapers, in relations with certain countries which do not agree with what you have just said, for example, we saw a certain confrontation with Spain, and how could you describe your relationship now with the Iberic Nation?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>Simeon, within all this dynamic there is an activity of much interference and disrespect against the Authorities of Nicaragua, including the President of the Republic, by countries, including Spain. Its embassies in Nicaragua maintain an activity that is very prone precisely to supporting individuals from these NGO´s who use them to make negative and policital propaganda campaigns.</p>

<p>We insist, we talk, we talk, we talk, and we say to them: The Mission of the Diplomatic Corps, of the Ambassadors, is to contribute to strengthening the Relations of Friendship, Cooperation and Solidarity, between the Countries, between the Governments, between the Peoples, not to interfere in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Many diplomats, including that of Spain, act as if they were Nicaraguan citizens, and we are very clear: The internal politics of Nicaragua is the exclusive competence of Nicaraguans, the Electoral Process is exclusive to Nicaraguans, the Electoral Council, the Government, political parties and the sovereign population, the Sovereign People of Nicaragua, which is the one that determines with its transparent, clean and peaceful vote; who are the authorities that it elects.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Speaking of media wars, this was one of the main topics recently at the International Security Conference here in Moscow, and precisely as examples of media attacks they showed Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Precisely Nicaragua in November is going to have its elections, something very important in the Democratic Process, how do you prepare for possible media attacks and are you going to take measures, such as accepting international observers, or something else?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>Media attacks are already very systematic. The media, as I said at the beginning, have put Nicaragua in the international focus, precisely for this reason, as part of the distorted media campaign, and unfortunately it must be said, that the majority of the media of the United States, of Europe, which are part of those big networks, those large consortiums, with the exception of a few cases which are media of great respect, that are very respectful, very objective and very profesional; take part in this fight, this offensive against Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The observation issue, that's part of the offensive aimed against Nicaragua. We cannot forget what happened in Bolivia, where the OAS actually designed and carried out an electoral coup d'état in Bolivia, which forced the ousting of President Evo Morales. We already have experience and we are clear that the OAS fulfills the role for which it was designed by the United States itself: A mechanism of active and permanent interventionism, to destabilize democratic, progressive, left wing governments, revolutionaries, that are not in agreement with the aggressive policies of the United States; which the Empire intends to destabilize and to overthrow in some cases; we already have the experience of the attempted coup d'état of 2018, precisely financed, organized and promoted by the Government, by the powerfull elites of the United States.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Minister, you just mentioned the Organisation of American States. What is the current relationship between this Agency and Nicaragua?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>We have a presence until now in the OAS, but we always maintain a defensive policy there. The OAS, as I said, being an instrument, is always attacking the Government of Venezuela, the legitimate and Constitutional Government of President Nicolás Maduro; it has promoted, together with the United States and other European countries, the recognition, by some countries, of their own interference in Venezuela, in an irrational and unjustifiable way, of course. And with Cuba also, with the blockade that we have already seen how in the 184 countries of the United Nations voted and reiterated the demand and the request to end the blockade of the sister Republic of Cuba.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Here we have mentioned on several occasions the issue of the United States, a country that introduced new sanctions against Nicaragua. Here it is interesting to note that there is already a new President, Joe Biden, that some say is going to be totally opposed to the Policies of Donald Trump, that he was going to be different. But how do you rate Biden in terms of the relations the United States can have with Nicaragua?</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>The United States, the American Empire talks a lot about Democracy, yet they have limited and reduced political party activity to two Parties; so it is a limited Democracy, reduced... what else is there to say. It is the Empire, there is no difference between one Party and the other, in terms of its foreign relations and its relations with neighbouring countries and with countries fighting for their freedom, for their democracy, for stability and for their well-being.</p>

<p>We do not see major differences between one government and the other, they always act like empires, they always attack States, they always attack countries, peoples, invade, destroy, steal their natural resources, their energy wealth... In short, they are an Imperial Power that history will judge, their American way of life really is the way of life made from the resources and the riches of the countries that they invade, they attack, they steal from, and they plunder. That is the truth, therefore, to seek a difference between one party and the other, we would probably have to look at that with a magnifying glass.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>Minister, back to regional issues. In recent years we have seen a wave of protests in countries like Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia and now we are seeing it in Colombia, where the people want change and face police violence. I would like to ask, how do these issues affect Nicaragua and its relations with these countries?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>First of all, I must tell you that we, as defined by the Government of President Ortega and Comrade Rosario Murillo, in foreign policy and in relation to the countries of Latin America, are respectful of non-interference in the internal affairs of all countries. That is why we are also very forceful, in demanding reciprocity, and in saying, both bilaterally, and multilaterally, no one should interfere in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>However, there are realities that are evident and that are also being the subject of the media, situations in these countries you mentioned. We are clear that, well, the populations also demand justice, peace, progress and security from their respective governments, and we respect, in this case, the internal situations of the States, of the Governments, and also of their Peoples.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>So in your opinion, Minister, is their currently collaboration at the regional level, is Latin America moving towards integration or disintegration at regional level?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>The Peoples of Latin America are clear that Unity and Integration are a vital necessity, internally within the Hemisphere, in the Continent, and externally as well, in order for our countries to truly achieve and conquer what would be our Second Independence.</p>

<p>Precisely the majority of countries of Latin America and the Caribbean are celebrating this year the Bicentennial of Independence of the old Spanish Empire; the old Spanish Empire that left with the bad habit and delayed memory of thinking that we are still their Colony, that we are still slaves, as in old times, where the Kingdom of Spain enslaved our populations, plundered all of our natural resources, fundamentally gold and silver, which is the basis and foundation, not only of Spain, but also of other Countries of Europe, that their development and wellbeing is based on the life of our populations and on their Natural Resources. That must not be forgotten by these countries, these Imperial Powers.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semyon Senderov</b></p>

<p>You also mentioned the issue of the U.S. blockade against Cuba, and one thing that we have seen in recent days is the vote on the resolution against the blockade, in the United Nations, something that has already become customary. The absolute majority of countries are against this blockade, but they are still two countries that support the blockade.</p>

<p>You said in one of your speeches that it was important to reform the UN. How would the Agency change, and in your view, what should be the role of the International Organizations, now?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>International Law, the UN Charter is also an important Instrument for the existence of the Countries. Of course, it must be democratized, yes, the UN, the Security Council, that is a process that has been going on for many decades, but it was also promoted by Father Miguel d'Escoto, our Chancellor, who was President of the General Assembly of the UN.</p>

<p>We are clear that these international entities are also used by the Western Powers as instruments, many times of aggression and of legalization of unjust situations for the countries and Peoples of the World. However, they must be reformed, we must continue with the process of reinventing them, of redesigning these Organizations, including the Security Council, democratizing it and democratizing the entire UN framework.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semion Sénderov</b></p>

<p>So, Minister, summing up this topic. In your opinion, does the UN, as we are seeing it today, serve its purpose or has it simply become a platform for debate?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>It´s a debate platform, it is at least a point where important points can be discussed and debated. We have already seen how some countries, the United States especially, block resolutions and decisions that are aimed at preventing crimes against humanity committed by some countries against some peoples, and changing that suddenly seems impossible or at least very difficult.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it is necessary to reform its actions and its operations. We must make prevail what we have achieved, up to now, regarding International Law, precisely so as to avoid aggressions and actions like the ones we saw recently, ships from the United Kingdom invading territory under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. In short, situations that suddenly place, in a very complicated situation, not only Russia, but the entire world really, because they are irresponsible actions and they should never occur.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semion Sénderov</b></p>

<p>Minister, one of the issues that cannot be set aside, one of the most important issues that occurs now, is the issue of the global COVID-19 pandemic. How do you face this situation in Nicaragua, have you been able to set aside the political relations with other countries in order to focus precisely on helping the Population?</p>

<p>We had the opportunity to visit one of the Russian Centers in Nicaragua, which is dedicated to vaccines; It was inaugurated a year ago I think. How do you also rate relations with Russia in this area?</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>Really, Health in Nicaragua is a national right and our Government has treated it with the highest priority, which provided us with possibilities, at the time of the COVID pandemic. Together with the participation of the Community as a protagonist, with Communities and Families, addressing these matters that are of social interest, we have been reasonably effective in stopping COVID19. The death rate is one of the lowest in the Region, and our health system has not collapsed, there is no excessive demand beyond the capabilities that we have to manage this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Russia has already provided important support to Nicaragua with regards to the vaccine, and within that relationship, we are also expecting more vaccines. We have also had a very positive relationship with India regarding vaccine support. And as you were saying, the MECHNIKOV Laboratory has been operating in our Country for more than a year, which precisely produces vaccines in our Country and also distributes to the Region. They are analyzing and seeing precisely the possibility, at this very moment, with a certain sense of urgency, of producing the anti-COVID vaccines in a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>Relations with Russia are excellent, they are very good, in general terms; our communication is very important, very fluid; solidarity in the different fields: Technical, Food, Medical, Commercial Exchanges, and Investments are also very positive. Our relationship with Russia is excellent.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semion Sénderov</b></p>

<p>Hopefully the situation with the virus improves soon. Minister, thank you very much for being with us.</p>

<p><b>Remarks by Foreign Minister Denis Moncada</b></p>

<p>Thank you very much, Semión, and very kind of you for the invitation to this Conference, to this Interview. So, we appreciate it. A cordial greeting to you, to your audience and the entire People of the Russian Federation, and a cordial greeting also from President Ortega, Vice President Murillo and the all the Nicaraguan people. We embrace you.</p>

<p><b>Journalist Semion Sénderov</b></p>

<p>Thank you very much, Minister, and until next time, thank you. It has been everything for the moment, thanks for your attention and until next time.</p>
