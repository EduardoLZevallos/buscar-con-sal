      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
A look at recent mainstream media coverage of in
Nicaragua<br>
      </span><br>

      <small>By Karla Jacobs, August 6th 2010</small></big><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">
      <br>
It is not surprising that readers of mainstream news media living
outside
Nicaragua are able to ascertain so little
about the country's political reality given that those outlets
provide next to no coverage of the opinions and arguments of the only
political force
that has actually
been shown to represent a significant chunk of public opinion - the
FSLN. <br>
      <br>
Similarly, few details are given about the connotations the
political figures and movements that <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span>
covered in the corporate media have within Nicaragua making
it nearly impossible to gauge the level of
relevance and credibility the
opinions presented would merit for a Nicaraguan audience. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opinion polls confirm FSLN as
largest political party by far</span><br>
      <br>
Two recent opinions polls, both of which were carried out in June 2010,
give an idea of the level of support the different political parties
and leaders have within the country. The first poll
(different summaries of which can be found <a href="http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/07/13/politica/31414">here</a>
and <a href="http://www.radiolaprimerisima.com/noticias/80536">here</a>)
was
carried
out
by
M&amp;R consultants whose political surveys have
traditionally
tended to favour the right wing political parties. <a href="http://www.revolucionsandinista.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Encuesta-10-de-Julio-2010.ppt">The
second
poll</a> was carried out by Siglo Nuevo consultants, a newly
founded outfit, whose surveys tend to favour the FSLN government.&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
Measured in slightly different ways, both polls find that in terms of
the general public's sympathies, the overall picture is one in which
at least a third of the
population does not identify itself with any party, between 33% and 45%
express support for the governing FSLN, and the sympathies
of the 17% - 25% of the population that expresses support for the
right wing opposition is divided between a number of different parties:<br>

The measurements of public perception of government programs and of the
opposition's political impact are equally revealing: the M&amp;R poll
found that 67.1% say<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> the
quality of the public education system
has improved under the Ortega government, while 62.3% say the
quality of care within the public health system has improved during the
same period.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The same poll found that 81.1% think the work carried out by the
opposition has a negative impact while only 13.6% believe it has a
positive impact. Similarly the Siglo Nuevo poll found that only 15.3%
approved of the work carried out by the deputies in the National
Assembly where the right wing opposition have a majority.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignoring on the ground reality
corporate media portrays popular discontent</span><br>
      <br>
Apparently oblivious to poll results like the ones mentioned above, the
impression that has been created by the corporate media regarding
political feeling in Nicaragua since the FSLN came to power in 2007, is
one of increasing popular discontent and unrest provoked
by what are described as the government's moves towards dictatorship. <br>
      <br>
This fictional
storyline really began to take root within mainstream media coverage of
Nicaragua after the
opposition's completely unfounded claims of fraud following the
municipal
elections of November 2008. <br>
      <br>
The media furore surrounding the opposition's bogus claims lasted for
several months, long enough to instil the false belief that Nicaragua
is run by an anti-democratic government in the minds of mainstream
media consumers around the world. <br>
      <br>
Subsequently, Nicaragua has pretty much dropped off the international
corporate media's radar except for a handful of ill-intentioned opinion
pieces and the occasional factually evasive, contextually bare
article to top up the already established consensus that Daniel Ortega
may not yet be a dictator, but he is working toward that end. <br>
      <br>
The main two events that have been picked up on and manipulated in the
international press during 2010 have been the two days of disturbances
related to the ongoing political power
struggle in April, and the recent replacement of a number of opposition
and Sandinista mayors and councillors. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reuters' misleading account of
ongoing political power struggle</span><br>
      <br>
A <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63T40K20100430">Reuters
article</a> dated April 30th with the headline "Tensions mount in
Nicaragua over Ortega re-election" is a classic example of the way the
corporate media portrays political events in Nicaragua exclusively
within the boundaries of the right wing opposition's distorted logic.<br>
      <br>
Unlike Reuters' affirmation that the brief disturbances on the streets
of Managua at the end of April were FSLN led "<span id="articleText"><span class="focusParagraph">protests against opposition efforts to block
leftist [Ortega]'s re-election next year</span></span>," actually
what Sandinista sympathizers were protesting about was the opposition
deputies' refusal to session in the National Assembly or to negotiate
with
the FSLN about the key election of 25 top posts within government
institutions. <br>
      <br>
Between them the opposition parties make up a majority in the
Nicaraguan legislative. As a result of their inability to work together
on a common political project, however, the right wing has had to
resort consistently to boycotting work in the legislative altogether
as part of what appears to be the logic that
if-we-can't-get-our-way-then-we-won't-let-you-get-yours-either.<br>
      <br>
These periodical boycotts of legislative work have been temporarily
successful in preventing the FSLN implementing its programme of
government. For example, the opposition deputies refused to approve the
2008 National Budget until
the second trimester of the year creating a precarious situation for
many public institutions in terms of being able to fulfil their
legally established obligations to the population. &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
So, although it was near on impossible to decipher from the article
itself, the main cause of the protests mentioned by Reuters was the
opposition's cynical and ongoing strategy to boycott their legislative
duties and sabotage the FSLN's
attempts to negotiate the pending election, in the National Assembly,
of 25 top
posts within the Supreme Court of Justice, the Supreme Electoral
Council, the Comptroller General's Office and a number of other State
institutions in which the current officials' terms have already expired or are
due to expire over the coming months. <br>
      <br>
The opposition has two good reasons not to take part in those
negotiations; firstly because the different opposition parties and
factions get on with each other so badly that they have been unable to devise and stick to a joint strategy that would
allow them to make the most of their majority in the legislation and
reduce to a minimum the quotas of power rendered to the FSLN. <br>
      <br>
Secondly, the longer those tops posts remain unfilled, the longer
officials whose original terms have now expired are obliged to stay on
in their positions and the easier it becomes for the
opposition to argue a degree of illegitimacy within governmental
institutions. <br>
      <br>
Indeed if they can get away with it, the opposition may well put off
the election of the 25 top posts until after the presidential elections
of
2011. That way they would oblige officials whose terms will have
expired more than a year
previously to oversee the national elections thus creating a situation
in which they can undermine the
credibility of an election process they look set to lose. <br>
      <br>
Precisely because all that context was missing, Reuters felt justified
quoting the leader of one of the main two opposition
factions which have refused to negotiate the election of the top posts,
Eduardo Montealegre's
comment: "[the political parties] have to talk for the good of the
country."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">El País' factual errors
demonstrate ignorance of relevant Nicaraguan legislation <br>
      <br>
      </span>Like the above mentioned Reuters article, a <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Daniel/Ortega/busca/todo/poder/elpepuint/20100705elpepuint_8/Tes">recent
article</a> in, supposedly left of centre, Spanish daily El País
titled "Daniel Ortega
wants all the power" chooses, not only to frame its narrative strictly
within the limits of the opposition's irrational perspective, but also
to consult only opposition representatives and sympathizers.<br>
      <br>
According to this article, which is about the replacement of a number
of local government officials between May and July this year, "the
President of Nicaragua crushed municipal autonomy with the removal of
five mayors," an argument which, like the cries of fraud in November
2008, is based solely on opposition claims of what happened. <br>
      <br>
El País goes on to contradict the impression the article
initially creates
- that it was Ortega who removed the mayors in question - by explaining,
accurately, that the local government officials were replaced following
majority votes in their respective local councils to that effect. <br>
      <br>
The newspaper then goes on to describe the replacement of the local
officials as "irregular"&nbsp; without referring to the <a href="http://www.transmuni.gob.ni/docs/Ley40.htm">Nicaraguan Municipal
Law</a>, article 28 of which states that the Municipal Council <font face="Arial">has the faculty to "remove the Mayor, Vice Mayor or
Councillors </font><font face="Arial">and incorporate replacements </font><font face="Arial">should any of the situations outlined in Articles 23 and
24 arise."<br>
      <br>
The situations outlined in Articles 23 and 24 include the situations
cited by the municipal councils prior to the resolutions ordering the
different municipal government officials' replacement - nepotism, the
existence
of
Comptroller General resolutions indicating those official's involvement
in acts of corruption and
repeated failure to obey Municipal Council resolutions, for
example.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      </font><br>
El País also failed to mention, or is unaware of, the fact that
the Nicaraguan Institute of Municipal Promotion (INIFOM) recently
oversaw a series of training workshops for local councillors as part of
an attempt to raise awareness about the functions and responsibilities
of the members of the maximum authority within Nicaraguan local
governments - the municipal councils. <br>
      <br>
According to the President of INIFOM, Edward Centeno, who gave <a href="tortilla/node/6285.html">an interview</a>
to a local TV channel at the end of June, the recent replacement of
different local government officials is a natural consequence of those
training workshops.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wikipedia's factually erroneous
account of recent Nicaraguan political history </span><br>
      <br>
Shoddy reporting on Nicaragua is not limited to the corporate media.
Information media like Wikipedia also engage in the divulgation of false accounts of specific episodes while omitting altogether
other crucial developments.<br>
      <br>
In the section "Nicaragua desde 1990" on the Spanish language Wikipedia
      <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua">page about
Nicaragua</a> the following statement is made: "In November 2008
municipal elections were carried out ... without international
observers."<br>
      <br>
In actual fact over 150 international observers, representatives of the
Central American and Caribbean Tikal Protocol, the South American Quito
Protocol and the Latin American Council of Electoral Experts (CEELA),
monitored the electoral process. <br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, the section completely ignores the important benefits of
Nicaragua's membership of ALBA and numerous other significant economic
and social advances of far deeper significance for the country than the
crisis fabricated by the opposition following the municipal elections
of 2008. <br>
      <br>
It is clear from the flagrant error and omissions mentioned above that
the Wikipedia information is edited from a centre-right political slant
and sourced from the mainstream media. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Media bases coverage on views of
politicians who represent 20% of popular opinion </span><br>
      <br>
The main weakness of the sort of journalistic and editing practises
engaged in by
these information and news media outlets when reporting Nicaraguan
politics is the tendency to back up sloppy arguments by quoting
representatives of political parties and factions that have been shown
over and again to enjoy a pitiful
level of support among the Nicaraguan population while omitting
altogether relevant opinions from the FSLN, the most
representative political party in the country. <br>
      <br>
By far the most frequently quoted Nicaraguan politician in the
international mainstream media is leader of the "Vamos con Eduardo"
faction (MVE), Eduardo Montealegre. Another popular choice is President
of the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), Edmundo
Jarquín,&nbsp; who's comments are usually used, deceptively, to
try to persuade liberal thinkers that the MRS represents a left wing
alternative in Nicaragua. <br>
      <br>Edmundo
Jarquin himself married into the wealthy and
influential Chamorro family. Politically centre-right, the Chamorro
family dominate printed news media&nbsp;in Nicaragua, making their
views and opinions a vital component of the disinformation feedback
loop that sustains the international media campaign against the FSLN
government.<br>
      <br>By
contrast, leader of the Constitutional Liberal Party (PLC), disgraced
former president of
the Republic, Arnoldo Alemán, still under indictment for his role in
multi-million corruption scandals, is seldom quoted. That may be due to
his very public fall from grace seven years ago. But other
representatives of his party are indeed<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>given a certain amount of
importance by the international media.<br>
      <br>
To understand what ideas and practises these people and
political parties (which together represent roughly 20% of popular
opinion) really stand for, corporate media consumers need to
delve into Nicaragua's recent
political history and then ask themselves if it is justifiable to
assume, as the mainstream media does, that the right wing opposition
is actually interested&nbsp; in democracy and honest public
administration.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Montealegre: multi-millionaire
banker indicted for corruption</span><br>
      <br>
If one takes the time to investigate Eduardo Montealegre's past,
it&nbsp; rapidly becomes clear why the corporate media's main source
for comment on national political events, has failed so
decidedly to attract more than, at most, 7.8% support for the political
faction he leads. <br>
      <br>
Montealegre, nicknamed "the mouse" in reference to his small stature
and lack of leadership charisma, is a multi millionaire banker
and a far right politician who has a case pending against him in the
Nicaraguan courts for multi-million dollar fraud
against the State resulting from his participation in the financial
operation referred to as the CENIs scandal. <br>
      <br>
The CENIs scandal, which is generally considered the biggest fraud in
the nation's history, resulted in the effective bankruptcy of the
Nicaraguan
State between 1999 and 2004 when, as a result of former neoliberal
governments' shamelessly illicit financial management of the State's
patrimony, the Central Bank incurred short term loan
obligations
equivalent to 95% of the country's available international reserves.<br>
      <br>
Montealegre played a key role in the third stage of the CENIs financial
operation when, during his time as Finance Minister under former
president Enrique Bolaños, he oversaw what Nicaragua's Comptroller-General's office has condemned as a rigged auction
of&nbsp; State properties and goods for approximately 10% of their
estimated value, according to the Public Prosecutor's Office
investigation into the scandal.<br>
      <br>
As Finance Minister, Montealegre was also responsible for the
re-engineering of the CENIs debt in 2003, a financial agreement which
the Public Prosecutor alleges to have disproportionately benefited
the private bank Bancentro of which Montealegre was a major share
holder and Director at the time.<br>
      <br>
Together the rigged auction and suspicious re-engineering of the CENIs
debt incurred US$100 million losses to the State (roughly 10% of
Nicaragua's annual budget at that time), according to the Public
Prosecutor's Office investigation. (See <a href="cenis.html">this article</a> for
further details about the CENIs scandal.)<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
      </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alemán's PLC:
epitome of corruption and mismanagement<br>
      <br>
      </span>Similarly, Arnoldo Alemán's PLC is strongly
associated with corruption and public sector mismanagement in the minds
of ordinary Nicaraguans. Indeed Eduardo Montealegre is just one of 39
former public officials from the two previous administrations (led by
former presidents Alemán and Bolaños) who have been
accused by the Public Prosecutor's Office of mismanagement of public
funds, embezzlement, fraud and other crimes as part of the CENIs
scandal. <br>
      <br>
The list of accused includes a whole swathe of top public officials
from the Alemán and Bolaños administrations, including
two
former presidents of the Central Bank, two former finance ministers,
and two former presidents of the Bank Superintendent's office, whom
one can only assume were placed in those positions precisely to help
aid the bankruptcy of Nicaragua in the name of the personal and
commercial benefit of a small group of local oligarchs and right wing
politicians.<br>

Alemán himself, convicted of the theft of millions of dollars of
public funds in 2003, was named the 9th most corrupt leader in recent
world history by the international non profit organization, Transparency International,
in 2004.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
      </span> In other words, the PLC and other political factions
further to the right represented by figures like Montealegre are
synonymous with corruption and anti democratic practises in Nicaragua.
They do not represent, as corporate media coverage suggests, a democratic
alternative for good government.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mundo Jarquín:
Development bank bureaucrat allied with the far
right<br>
      </span><br>
The MRS and its leader, Edmundo Jarquín, are often portrayed as
a morally superior left wing alternative to the FSLN in Nicaragua. In
practice, though, Jarquín and his colleagues have allied
themselves closely with far
right forces in the National Assembly - taking part in the above
mentioned legislative boycotts, going on the campaign trail with
Montealegre in 2008 and even "borrowing" two MVE deputies in order to
maintain
the party's status as a legislative bloc. That record renders completely implausible
their claim to represent a left of centre position.<br>
      <br>
In the latest of a series of efforts to minimize a number of MRS members'
revolutionary origins, Jarquín announced last month that
the
party would not celebrate the 31st anniversary of the Popular
Sandinista Revolution:<br>
      <br>
"83% of the Nicaraguan population was 14 or younger in 1979," <a href="http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/07/17/politica/31792/imprimir">explained
Jarquín</a>, "so, whether we like it or not, ... neither the
merits of the fight against Somoza, nor the merits or demerits of
somocismo are very significant ... for the immense majority of
Nicaraguans."<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>The MRS' position regarding the latest anniversary of the
Revolution is a clear indicator that Jarquín and his colleagues
have little interest in promoting the collective memory of the
barbarity of
the Somoza dictatorship given that such an exercise would decidedly
undermine the political movement's propaganda claim that Nicaraguans are living under a dictatorship today. <br>
      <br>
In it's anxiety to bolster this bogus claim the MRS has even linked
itself to the most extreme promoters of the hate campaign against
Ortega who appear to advocate assassination attempts against the
President. "Ortega and Somoza are the same
thing" is the slogan on a political poster depicting an image of Ortega
and Somoza splattered in blood&nbsp; and "signed" Rigoberto (the name
of Somoza's assassin). This poster is <a href="http://www.partidomrs.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=383">linked
to</a> under "afiches
políticos" (political posters) on the MRS website.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span><br>
Given that the MRS has, at most, 1.7% support among the population, the
amount of coverage awarded to former Inter American Development Bank
bureaucrat, Edmundo Jarquín, in the two national newspapers, El
Nuevo Diario and La Prensa, can only be accounted for by the fact that
those same two newspapers are owned by the media barons of the Chamorro
family into which
he married (former president Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is Edmundo
Jarquín's mother-in-law).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Crisis in the Nicaraguan
right&nbsp; </span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
Last month the latest in a series of attempts to unite the different
right wing factions fell through, provoking the express annoyance and
disappointment of certain representatives of the Catholic Church
hierarchy, "civil society" and big business who have been pushing for
the creation
of one big opposition alliance to compete against the FSLN in next
year's presidential elections. <br>
      <br>
This latest failure to consolidate a unified alliance, like the recent
devastating poll results, is indicative of the ongoing crisis suffered
by
the Nicaraguan right - a crisis which began during the
Bolaños administration when US and European diplomats encouraged
the new president to carve out his own political space and dump
Alemán in what appeared to be an attempt&nbsp; to sweep the
extent
of the corruption engaged in by their Nicaraguan allies under the
carpet by turning Alemán into a scapegoat for the fraudulent
practise and mismanagement that had become
generalized within government institutions. <br>
      <br>
With time it became clear, however, that Bolaños and his foreign
advisers had underestimated Alemán's clout as leader of the PLC.
Even during his brief period in jail and the months he spent under
house arrest, Alemán never lost his grip over the majority
of&nbsp; key players within the PLC. Meanwhile, the group that
supported
Bolaños in his quest to smear Alemán, which included
Montealegre, were forced to create their own political factions
separate from the PLC. <br>
      <br>
The resulting division of the right wing, which is as marked today as it ever
was, was founded on, and is upheld by, profound mutual mistrust between
Alemán and those that perpetuated his dethroning as undisputed
leader of the Nicaraguan right.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The ongoing crisis within the right has created a situation in which
the right wing, in opposition for the first time since 1990, is too
busy constructing and de-constructing political alliances to come up
with a viable policy alternatives. <br>
      <br>
On top of this, poll results since the FSLN came to power in 2007 show
that the right
wing's voting base has not only remained divided but has actually begun
an increasingly devastating process of evaporation: while the FSLN
voting base appears to have at least remained solid and probably grown
since 2007, the percentage of the population who say they do not
identify with any
political party has escalated. This trend almost certainly corresponds
to disillusioned
traditional right wing voters and the sons and daughters of families
who have traditionally voted for the right.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mainstream media's stance
corresponds to a wider geopolitical strategy </span><br>
      <br>
Apparently the mainstream media does not consider any of this
background
and context relevant when deciding who should be projected as advocates
for popular will and democracy in Nicaragua. If it weren't for the
sinister undertones of that decision, it would be laughable that the
corporate press have elected
representatives of the PLC, MVE and MRS as spokespeople for
democracy. <br>
      <br>
It is reasonable to assume, however, that the mainstream information
and news media's
fallacious portrayal of political events in Nicaragua corresponds to
the wider geopolitical strategy of the Western imperialist governments
who appear intent on stamping out the newest forms of social and
political revolution in Latin America.<br>
      <br>
The corporate media's role is to make the implementation of that
strategy appear consistent with the norms of Western moral code. In
other words, to make out that the end goals of that strategy are
"democracy and freedom" for the Nicaraguan people. </td>
