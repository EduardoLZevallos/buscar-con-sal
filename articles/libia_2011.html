            <br>
            Simone Weil wrote that what shocked people in Europe about
            the barbarity of the democratically elected government in
            Nazi Germany was the application in Europe of colonial
            methods of repression and mass murder. People outside Europe
            and North America can see nothing has changed. Mass murder
            comes as naturally to the current politicians fronting for
            NATO's Cosa Nostra - Ashton, Cameron, Clinton, Obama,
            Sarkozy and the rest - as it ever did to Goering and
            Himmler. <br>
            <br>
            The banal evil of these individuals serves a monstrous
            political and economic system able to find trillions of
            dollars to rescue its bankers while, for the sake a few tens
            of billions, the impoverished global majority starves. This
            pathological psychology has already been analysed by writers
            from Hannah Arendt to Edward Said. A strong component of
            that evil is the colonial mentality embodied in the NATO
            gangsters' rejection of all proposals for a negotiated
            settlement to the Libyan conflict. <br>
            <br>
            African Union leaders, their peace proposals trashed, have
            been left in no doubt that their place is to hang up NATO
            country leaders' coats, wash their dishes and clean their
            rest rooms. On the ground in Libya, that deep colonial
            contempt is expressed by NATO's complicity in racist pogroms
            and lynchings. Complacency in the face of such horrors are a
            vital qualification for political leadership in Europe and
            North America. The ignominy of Barack Obama and Susan Rice
            could hardly be more complete. <br>
            <br>
            The full extent of European and North American war crimes in
            Libya may never be known. Western corporate mass media and
            alternative media have worked hard to conceal them. But even
            NATO's sub-contract renegades talk about 60,000 dead. NATO's
            relentless indiscriminate bombardment has been killing
            civilians in Libya for over 6 months now. NATO's ground
            invasion of Tripoli involved helicopter gunship massacres.
            The use of cluster bombs and chemical warfare has been
            reported in Sirte and Bani Walid. <br>
            <br>
            UN Resolution 1973 was only ever passed by the UN Murder
            Inc. Security Council as a pretext to be systematically
            violated. It was the faintest of alibis for activities
            already well in hand in support of&nbsp; NATO's terrorist
            Benghazi sub-contractors. Logistical support,
            communications, training and weapons support were all well
            advanced in February this year, weeks before UN Resolution
            1973. The attack on Libya had already been rehearsed in
            NATO's Southern Mistral military exercise of November 2010.
            <br>
            <br>
            Penal Western sanctions against Libya through the 1990s get
            written out of coverage of the Libya conflict. This happened
            because that context explains the logic of Libya's internal
            politics over the last decade. Muammar al-Ghaddafi and his
            sympathisers came to resist increasingly assertive moves by
            corrupt pro-Western government officials to deepen foreign
            corporate friendly policies inimical to the interests of the
            Libyan people. <br>
            <br>
            NATO governments were bullying, blackmailing and suborning
            individuals like Moussa Koussa, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, Mahmoud
            Jibril and Abdel Fattah Younes to betray the Libyan people
            and destroy the Libyan Jamahiriya system. These very
            functionaries played a leading role in the human rights
            abuses so loudly denounced by supporters of the Libyan
            contract coup-insurrection. NATO governments bought off
            those sinister and corrupt officials and teamed them up with
            reactionaries allied to notorious Arab despots and with
            NATO's al-Qaeda terrorist sub-contractors.<br>
            <br>
            The stubborn reality is that a clear majority of people in
            Libya have supported Muammar al-Ghaddafi, his Libyan
            government colleagues and the resistance they are
            organizing. That support derives from the Libyan
            Jamahiriya's unquestionable legitimacy based on its
            participatory political system and its economic development
            over the previous 40 years, unparalleled in Africa. This
            undeniable reality has spectacularly destroyed the
            credibility of Western political and media leaders across
            the political spectrum. <br>
            <br>
            Libya is the latest in a NATO country spree of serial
            interventions. Military aggression has been the modus
            operandi in Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Ivory
            Coast and Libya. In Latin America and the Caribbean NATO has
            preferred to use coups. They failed in Venezuela in 2002, in
            Bolivia in 2008 and in Ecuador in 2010. They succeeded in
            Haiti in 2004 and in Honduras in 2009. Both Haiti and
            Honduras are under effective military occupation by regimes
            whose questionable legitimacy has been imposed by NATO
            country governments. <br>
            <br>
            NATO is aggressively installing military facilities in
            Eastern Europe. Its most powerful member carries out
            aggressive naval operations in the South China Sea. Around
            the globe NATO member countries threaten peace and stability
            either through a direct military presence or through
            extremely aggressive diplomatic and economic means. In
            flagrant violation of the UN Charter, NATO country war
            criminal leaders Nicolas Sarkozy and Hillary Clinton
            threaten Iran. <br>
            <br>
            The elite dominated countries of North America, Europe and
            their Pacific allies are in profound crisis internally and
            even more so relative to their competitors. Domestically,
            they repress protests against declining living standards.
            Overseas, bereft of authority and credibility, they use
            their destructive military power to slow their relative
            decline. Libya is like Spain in the 1930s. It marks the
            point of no return in what is already a worldwide military
            conflict between the global elites and the impoverished
            majority. <br>
