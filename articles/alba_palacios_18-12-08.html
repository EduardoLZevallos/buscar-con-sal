<td style="width: 650px; vertical-align: top; text-align: justify;"> <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Interview with Alba Palacios</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">, </span><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; font-family: sans-serif;">Second Secretary of the Executive Committee of Nicaragua's National Assembly</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif;">by toni solo, December 18th, 2008</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
About a year ago, you gave a very interesting interview to my colleague
the Swedish journalist Dick Emanuelsson on your view of the development
of the Nicaraguan government's programme after its first year. I wonder
if it might be possible for you to talk broadly about how you feel the
government's programme has developed over this last year?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">AP:
Well in practice on January 10th it will be two years of President
Ortega's government. In these two years, then, the situation has been a
very complicated one, because, here, we took over a State organized in
a way that did not meet people's needs and international cooperation
was not focused on the main priorities that have to do with poverty
reduction.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
the government, whose main policy priority is the fight against poverty
and to eradicate the principal social ills of the great majority of the
people, found itself with this phenomenon of a State in bits - health
and education practically privatized, widespread unemployment. A pretty
dramatic situation and, well, the government had to start almost from
scratch really in, terms of the country's true situation.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">On
that basis it had to begin negotiating changes with international
cooperation donors on the efforts that might be made, given the large
quantity of resources spent on bureaucratic and personnel costs,
including foreign personnel, originating from the different countries
that offer cooperation. All that caused, shall we say, conflicts and
delays and so forth. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
at the same time, the President was organizing fundamental programmes.
The first thing he did was to re-structure the health and education
systems from the point of view of guaranteeing free health and
education which, in practice, people in Nicaragua had been denied. That
is one of the main advances of this new government.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There's
been a literacy campaign since illiteracy had increased in the country
during the 16 years of neoliberal governments. And really there's been
a lot of progress on the issue of illiteracy. The government's
objective is to reduce illiteracy to zero. And if in some areas that
may not have been achieved well we hope at least if not reducing it to
zero, then to reduce the number of illiterate people substantially.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
is also the programme of eye operations supported by Cuba and
Venezuela, whereby thousands of Nicaraguans who had no chance of having
this type of operation have got their sight back as part of this very
well known Mission Miracle.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
then there's the Zero Hunger programme which has already brought a
productive benefit package to a good number of women, heads of
household of low income rural families, so they can gradually
accumulate basic components to be able to feed themselves.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There's
also the Zero Usury programme, made up of zero interest loans for women
in poor urban districts who need small loans so as to be able to start
a shop, a bakery, a tortilla business, a sewing business and so on. In
this way that whole sector has been easing itself out of the loan-shark
framework their situation had forced them into.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
then too there's everything that has to do with funding for
cooperatives and small and medium producers, by means of various other
programmes. There's the process of guaranteeing legal title to land
that has been moving forward pretty well, although there is still much
to do.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
addition to all that, there's the work on streets and rural roads. This
programme is called Streets for the People, because it does not deal in
highways but rather with making streets in low-income barrios and
making roads in rural areas and communities, so as to improve living
conditions and access for produce and movement of produce, and the
mobility of people who live in those barrios and in those rural
communities who were shoved to the margins all these years.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">A
housing project has also been started. There is a great deal to do on
housing. But we have to do so with a different vision, because before
there was what was called Plan Techo (Plan Roof), which provided just a
roof and a floor and a very small house. This government's vision is to
provide at least two bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen with tiles,
a bathroom. So it is a different vision of a new kind of more dignified
housing for low income people. So, that programme has started and is
progressing.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">A
big problem that has been overcome was the problem of power cuts, the
issue of electricity. We had cuts of eight to twelve hours. Today they
are sporadic and for entirely technical reasons. And also an effort has
been made to control energy and water prices. The Nicaraguan Energy
Institute this year made two price cuts, one now at the end of November
and one at the beginning of December, to try and protect the pocket of
people in Nicaragua.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
is also the Food for the People programme, by means of which a large
number of points of sale have been arranged throughout the country to
permit people to buy rice, cooking oil and other products at cheaper
prices accessible to the community and to attack the speculative market
in basic grains controlled by big business.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We
can say that the energy framework is also changing. It is no longer
just to reduce power cuts to zero, which is costly given the price of
diesel, but also new projects and alternative programmes for generating
energy that are going to be developed and are being developed currently
in different parts of the country.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">There
has been some employment creation. There has been a certain level of
investment. I don't think it has been as much as is needed yet. There
is a need for more sources of employment. In two years, after all, it
is difficult to do away with all the things that are wrong, but steps
are being taken. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Those
steps obviously had their effects and results in November's municipal
elections. But the right wing opposition groups have not wanted to
accept that defeat and we hope that the situation will soon sort itself
out so it does not continue to affect the country, trying to cut
international aid from Europe or the United States. Because in the end
the ones affected directly are Nicaragua's people.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And,
well, the President is seeking other alternatives with other coutnries
to try and meet the urgent needs of our people so that at least in
another five years and in a situation of world crisis ( and the effects
of that crisis are still to be felt in our country, in our region) we
may have better conditions to be able to defend ourselves as best as
the reality of our under-developed country permits.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Funding
small producers, providing seeds, all that is being done for the
cooperative sector and for small producers, this is of the utmost
importance, because the big business sector, big capital, that sector
already has its capacity, its skills and its local and national
markets,which have yet to be affected as well.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
UP to what point do you think these national government policies
affected the municipal level in the elections of November 9th?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: It had an effect. It did have an effect. And one has to
remember that before the elections here in the National Assembly, some
US$50 million in loans on the one hand was already being held up and on
the other hand a budget reform earmarked for addressing the problem of
the highways,&nbsp; impassable roads and the effects on thousands of
families of the rains. There they remained and have yet to be approved
to this day because the opposition parties reckoned that if they
supported the government in meeting people's needs then that would
affect the vote.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">In
practice they recognize benefits to the people do affect the vote, in
other words, what happened was a campaign complaining to the US and
European ambassadors that the opposition parties were being left in a
very difficult position. So now we have 109.8 million dollars that will
now be lacking for budget support, for improving drinking water in
different parts of the country, for improving various technical
training centres, for providing more credit to small and medium
producers, among other things that need support and attention.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
it's logical that if a government is focusing its efforts on the least
well off and people on low incomes are impoverished regardless of
whatever ideology they may have, then generally they are going to look
favourably on that government. And that is what has happened and that
is what these opposition leaders have been unwilling to accept.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The
right wing had sixteen years in government. If they had done for people
all the things they offered to do in their campaign, they would have
stayed in government. But instead the situation got worse, unemployment
ballooned, poverty grew, hunger increased, social problems increased.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">I
think the opposition lacks a national vision, thinking of the people
instead of primarily their own economic, political and personal
interests. Unfortunately that does have an effect. This fight against
poverty could do more and better things if the opposition had a more
responsible position or if it were really interested in the great
majority of our people.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
So one can say in fact that the reason the right wing opposition failed
to get the results they hoped for from the elections was that , perhaps
above all at a municipal level but also at a national level they were
not offering a programme that convinced people?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba Palacios: That is so,in part. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
But if one accepts that, would it be true to say that - what you have
pointed out and suggested, that the opposition is behaving in a way
destructive of the national interest - do you think they have decided
to choose&nbsp; that behaviour as a strategy because they don't have
another one?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba Palacios: Yes</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS: Would it be fair to say that?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: One has to remember that the right wing strategy to prevent
the Frente Sandinista coming to power was based on a campaign of fear.
Fear of war, fear of economic boycott, fear that shortages and
rationing would appear again, resulting from all that part we lived
through, fear of war also implied military service. So those arguments
collapsed. They collapsed because&nbsp; the President won, there was no
military service, no war, no rationing, no State control.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So,
what's left to them? Well, they can dream up new methods., new lines of
attack against a government they believe might stay in power for a long
time if it is able to develop its social and economic policies, a
government that excludes their personal and economic interests.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
they have invented the issue of dictatorship, you see, of
authoritarianism. And now as a last resort, knowing they were going to
lose the elections they began to say there was going to be fraud and
they have now mounted a campaign of a non-existent supposed fraud,
advised and accompanied by foreign governments, in this case the US
embassy, the US government and some European governments, which are the
ones advising them and funding them.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is a model and framework that is not new in Latin America. They have
used it and continue using it in Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and
Nicaragua. So all this is part of a plan. They have not accepted that
the left wing can be in government. For them, democracy is only for
their interests and for the right wing. Democracy for them is not
something for the impoverished or for the left wing. So that is their
dilemma. That is their situation.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
they are going to continue with their media campaign, with their
pressure - now they are freezing some aid accounts, freezing the
Millenium Challenge Account, now other European governments say they
are going to freeze a series of resources. All this is so as to
continue a plan of internal destabilization, of internal discontent, to
upset things with the ultimate objective of ensuring enough votes to be
able to force the Frente Sandinista out of government in the next
elections.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS: But the next elections are in 2011. Is the opposition capable of being that ruthless?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: Well. They have two ways to go. One, by generating
instability and, why not say it, intervention in our country. And, two,
to try and overthrow the government prior to 2011. They are working on
those strategies. And this is nothing but a permanent strategy of
sustained systematic attack and suffocation of the government so as to
appear, by their criteria, in a better light to the public.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
From a constitutional point of view, where does that leave the National
Assembly? Because if the legislature is going to be out of action, how
can the government work to implement its programme?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: I think that quite quickly, let's hope it won't take too
long, it may be possible to sort out the problem here in the National
Assembly. The truth is that the president of the National Assembly has
managed to avoid an unconstitutional action aimed at approving a law
that contravenes the constitution.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Because
whether they like it or not, when the opposition have won with that
Supreme Electoral Council everything has been perfect, but now when
they lose, everything is imperfect. But that is the law, that is the
Constitution. The Supreme Electoral Council is the body defined as
managing electoral matters. The legislative power does not have those
attributes and therefore cannot promote a law that threatens the
constitutional order. And that is the situation.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Let's
hope that in January, once Christmas and the New Year are over, a
little more consideration will be in play and that a political
negotiation makes progress whereby, if what is desired is to change the
electoral system, then for this to be done via a reform of the
electoral law, which is a constitutional law requiring the requisite
number of votes for its reform.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
the opposition have not wanted to act in that way, because they do not
have the votes they need. They have tried to work via an ordinary law
which, on the one hand threatens the constitution and on the other
gives them, one might say, space for a campaign of permanent and
systematic attack domestically and above all internationally, which is
the fundamental objective they pursue.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
There is a technical point that people unfamiliar with Nicaragua's
constitution may not understand which is the fact that neither side in
the National Assembly has been able to form a legal quorum or majority.
How far might this go towards causing a more prolonged paralysis?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: Well, let's hope the paralysis does not continue - it's two
months now, November and December that have been lost in terms of work
here in the National Assembly. On January 9th, a new Executive
Committee has to be elected. So you have two things, one the election
of the new Executive Committee and two, making progress on the people's
economic and social agenda. And the electoral issue needs to be left to
the instance that deals with it, or, if one wants to change the
electoral system, then enter into a reform process as established by
the law and by the constitution.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But,
well, one has to wait, really. We hope that respectful consideration
will prevail and not an attack on the government just for the sake of
damaging the government, because in the end the ones who pay the price
are the people of Nicaragua who need that help, that solidarity, that
development cooperation. And this is what is required of a political
class concerned to benefit the people. But, for now, the opposition is
not showing that concern.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
What effect on the work of the National Assembly do you think might
result from the swearing in of the municipal authorities scheduled for
January 15th? One has to suppose that if the opposition mayors take
office they are recognizing the authority of the Supreme Electoral
Council. Could that have a positive impact?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: In fact it would, because that is the direction things are
moving in really, while there is no case made demonstrating to the
Supreme Electoral Council that there was fraud in one of the
municipalities, as they have sought to show, then the mayors have to
take office in accordance with the law. Once they are declared elected,
then they have to take office and things will take their course. Where
Liberals are in office, they will run their municipalities, likewise
the Sandinistas, where they are in office, and the others, like the ALN
for example, so as to begin to get to work.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS: Is there any sign the PLC may order their mayors-elect to refuse to take office?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: I have not heard that yet. But it is the duty of the elected
mayors and councillors to take up the duties for which they put
themselves forward in tehir communities. So the 10th or the 15th or the
day specified by the Council, that day teh new democratically elected
authorities have to take office as a result of the electoral process. A
process the right wing didn't take kindly to, nor did the US government.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
Speaking of the US government and foreign intervention in general, the
latest comments of ambassador Callahan seem to be very clear and
categorical - that he gives the government 90 days to take, or not,
some measure, that they may like or dislike, and on that basis
supposedly the US authorities will look again at another decision on
the famous Millenium Challenge Account. But it is very suspicious for
me and other observers that those 90 days end exactly a few days before
the elections in El Salvador. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba Palacios: Yes, it's part too of the pressure on El Salvador.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
So do you agree that we're not just talking about what happens here in
Nicaragua but about things that affect what happens in the whole region?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: Yes, the whole region. It is a model that has been used in
Venezuela, in Bolivia, in Ecuador and obviously in El Salvador. What
they intend to say is, ok, if a leftist government wins there, it's
going to have the same problems as the government in Nicaragua has. We
are going to block it. And obviously, that benefits the right wing in
El Salvador and the governing party, ARENA.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But,
well, the Salvadoran people will also have to give battle and God
willing , given the situation developing to put pressure on the vote in
El Salvador, God willing the people will vote in accordance with their
own needs and not in accordance with external pressure which ultimately
will not resolve their problems.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">They
know that in El Salvador there is a good chance, a realistic chance
that the FMLN will win and in that way the political situation in
Central America will remake itself in favour of the Central American
peoples and not to the benefit of the interests of North American
multinational companies which have dominated the region's politics and
economy. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
What impact, if any, might the First Summit of Latin American and
Caribbean governments have had which included the presence of Cuba and
without the presence of the government of the United States? Might it
be possible for that message to have an effect on the policies of the
region's governments?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: I think so, because Latin America is taking the necessary
steps to continue uniting, articulating itself, showing itself to be a
region regardless of the differences that exist between the
governments, because there are right wing governments in Latin America.
But the fact they are all together looking at their own problems also
has to do with the very crisis that there is in the North. The crisis
of the recession that is going to affect everybody regardless of their
political position and which must therefore affect the whole region.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">And
all that is caused by the energy crisis, the food problems, so that is
obviously obliging governments to seek a way out by means of a more
regional position, a position of greater autonomy and dignity. Regional
unity is going to strengthen, faced with a country that traditionally
used bilateral relations and decided who was to govern and who was not
to govern in our region based on their own economic interests, the
interests of their big business people and their multinational
companies.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">But
that is changing now, thanks be to God, since Latin America is emerging
as a region which is, furthermore, prioritizing its local trade,
economic exchange among the people of Latin America, economic exchange
in the South. And I think we are the winners in that really.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">So
let's hope the new government in the United States will have a
different vision to the one of the last two periods of Republican
government. At least being more respectful really and that would mean a
great deal. That they might refrain from interfering in our region
would mean a lot, even if they did not help us. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">TcS:
One last question, Deputy. Do you think it will be crucial for the
government's programme, this matter of a possible withdrawal of
development cooperation by some European governments and the United
States?</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Alba
Palacios: Of course. It all has its effect. We're not going to say it
has no effect. It will have an effect and that is going to put the
government in a position where it has to go looking for new resources
in other countries. </span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">For
that reason I think the President is engaging in a series of relations
beyond Europe and the United States, to try and make good the gaps that
could be caused for us economically if, in effect, they start to
blockade Nicaragua via withdrawing development cooperation or freezing
it as they have just done.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">It
is a situation that has to be resolved really and that the government
has to face and look for resources elsewhere. And I think, with
sufficient will and negotiation, that will be achieved.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">We
would like to have that development cooperation because it would be in
addition to other help we might get. But well, if that is their
decision, well, it's unfortunate, but never mind. I think that we, the
Nicaraguan people have our dignity and we're not going to give in to
that kind of thing. We will have to find some way out. Via his
international relationships, the President is going to find a solution,
go looking for resources for the programmes that are left without
funding and which are of benefit to our people.</span><br><br></td>
