      <p style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Nicaragua's
political panorama going into November's presidential campaign </p>
      <p style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">By Karla Jacobs, March 23rd 2011</p>
      <p>March 18th was the deadline for the political alliances and
parties
planning to take part in Nicaragua's presidential election on November
6th to inscribe their presidential and vice presidential candidates
with the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE). With that procedure
completed, the political panorama leading into those national elections
is far clearer. </p>
      <p>The respective candidates for the five political currents
taking part in the Nicaraguan election process are as follows:</p>
      <p>Name of alliance / party Presidential candidate Vice
Presidential candidate</p>
      <p>FSLN led Unida Nicaragua Triunfa<br>
alliance (left) Daniel Ortega Omar Halleslevens</p>
      <p>PLC led GANA alliance<br>
(center right) Arnoldo Alem&aacute;n Francisco Aguirre</p>
      <p>PLI led UNE alliance (far right) Fabio Gadea Edmundo
Jarqu&iacute;n</p>
      <p>ALN (far right) Enrique Qui&ntilde;&oacute;nez Diana Urbina</p>
      <p>APRE (far right) Miguel Garcia Elizabeth Rojas</p>
      <p>The two most recent opinion polls to have been published in
Nicaragua place Ortega in first place with a significant advantage over
both Alem&aacute;n and Gadea. The extent to which public approval
ratings for
the three main presidential candidates vary according to these polls,
however, has raised suspicions among many analysts about the accuracy
with which they can be accredited. </p>
      <p>An M&amp;R Consultants poll carried out in December 2010 found
that
42.7% of the population plan to vote for Ortega, 14.4% for Fabio Gadea
and 7.4% for Alem&aacute;n. A Cid Gallup poll carried out a month later
in
January 2011, meanwhile, found that 36% plan to vote for Ortega, 23%
for Alem&aacute;n and 17% for Gadea. </p>
      <p>Omar Halleslevens: FSLN&#8217;s vice presidential candidate</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most interesting and, for some, surprising outcome
of
the presidential and vice presidential candidate inscription process
was the inscription of former head of the Nicaraguan Armed Forces Omar
Halleslevens as Daniel Ortega's running mate. While it had become clear
in recent weeks that current Vice President Jaime Morales Carazo was
not planning to stand again, the FSLN's alternative candidate was kept
a secret until the day of the inscription. </p>
      <p>Halleslevens, a former FSLN guerrilla and founder of the
Nicaraguan
Army, was head of the armed forces between 2005 and 2010. During his
time in the top post he was shown consistently to be one of the most
popular public figures in Nicaragua. </p>
      <p>In an M&amp;R opinion poll published in October 2009, just
four
months before Halleslevens' term as head of the armed forces came to an
end, he was found to be the second most popular public figure in the
country, second only to head of the National Police, Aminta Granera.
The same poll found that 73.3% of the public regarded the National Army
as the most trustworthy public institution in the country. </p>
      <p>Political analyst and writer Toni Solo considers the choice of
Halleslevens as vice presidential candidate for the FSLN led Unida
Nicaragua Triunfa alliance to be &#8220;very astute.&#8221; </p>
      <p>As Solo points out in Tortilla con Sal's most recent audio
commentary on Nicaraguan current events, Halleslevens' candidacy not
only satisfies the need felt among much of the FSLN's grass roots
support network for fewer major concessions to be made to the FSLN's
political allies, but the choice is also one which furthers greatly the
FSLN government's double motto of national unity and reconciliation.</p>
      <p>Although Halleslevens can be considered a national figure
&#8220;very much
within the Sandinista family, &#8230; he is as far as you could imagine from
being someone you would describe as a sectarian political figure,&#8221; says
Solo, &#8220;&#8230;[he] symbolizes national unity and reconciliation.&#8221; </p>
      <p>It also seems unlikely that the predictable opposition
argument that
Halleslevens' candidacy in some way represents the militarization of
civil power will have much impact on the FSLN's campaign given his
previously mentioned popularity which is based to a large extent on the
predominant feeling among ordinary Nicaraguans that Halleslevens is a
moderate, sensitive and thoroughly unaggressive person. </p>
      <p>ALN: the unpredictable factor in November's elections </p>
      <p>There were no other real surprises on March 18th other than a
last
minute change of heart by evangelical pastor Elizabeth Rojas who
decided not to run as Enrique Qui&ntilde;&oacute;nez' vice presidential
candidate on
the ALN ticket but to run with Miguel Angel Garc&iacute;a, former
education
minister (from the Bola&ntilde;os government), as a candidate for the
little
known APRE party. </p>
      <p>This decision, apparently, was the outcome of a last minute
breakdown in negotiations between Qui&ntilde;&oacute;nez' campaign team
and the
Evangelical organization Asamblea de Dios (which Rojas represents)
regarding quotas of power within their informal electoral alliance. </p>
      <p>Some analysts believe this last minute split from the Asamblea
de
Dios marks a significant setback for the Qui&ntilde;&oacute;nez led ALN
electoral
campaign given the potential such an alliance would have offered in
terms of penetrating the ever increasing presence and influence of
Evangelical churches at a grass roots level.</p>
      <p>Saying that though, Qui&ntilde;&oacute;nez' talent as a
political operator has
been underlined by other recent events concerning his campaign namely
his success in convincing both prominent PLC member Jos&eacute; Rizo
and
popular far right TV presenter Jaime Arellano to support his campaign. </p>
      <p>These fluctuations within the ALN political current are
symbolic of
the unpredictability of this political force which recent polls place
in a distant fourth place but which, technically, is considered the
second strongest political force by the CSE given that it came in
second place in the 2006 presidential elections as part of an alliance
led by former presidential candidate Eduardo Montealegre. </p>
      <p>Being considered the second force entails a range of
privileges
regarding the party's presence at voting centers which will play in the
ALN's favour on election-day. It seems realistic at this point,
however, to say the best outcome the ALN can hope for would be one that
allowed the party to maintain the six National Assembly seats currently
occupied by ALN representatives. </p>
      <p>Battle will be between FSLN and PLC</p>
      <p>As Nicaraguan political analyst William Grigsby suggests in a
recent
article about the current national political situation (&#8220;Victoria del
FSLN har&aacute; posible profundizar los cambios,&#8221; <a
 href="tortilla/node/8001.html"
 title="http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/8001">http://www.tortillaconsal.com/tortilla/node/8001</a>
      <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>),
there is reason to believe that, despite the corporate media's hype
surrounding the candidacy of Fabio Gadea, November's presidential
elections will turn out to be a battle fought principally between the
FSLN and the PLC led alliances. </p>
      <p>As part of his overall analysis Grigsby points out that not
only are
there many reasons why Gadea's candidacy is unlikely to appeal to the
average Nicaraguan voter (he is too old, too unknown and too
uncharismatic) but, being a newly formed political alliance, the PLI
alliance backing Gadea lacks the necessary grass roots organizational
structure so essential to electoral success in Nicaragua. </p>
      <p>Just to take part in a national election parties require a
minimum
of 60,000 grass roots militants around the country who represent their
party at voting centers on election day, a prerequisite it is far from
clear the PLI alliance, with its mish mash make up of mini political
factions and party dissidents, is able to fulfill.</p>
      <p>Another disadvantage faced by the PLI is the likelihood that,
between now and May when political alliances should inscribe their
candidates for deputies, major internal divisions will threaten the
alliance's integrity as too many candidates squabble over the small
number of winning positions the alliance has to offer.</p>
      <p>The PLC, on the other hand, has the advantage of having what
can be
considered the closest thing to a strong presidential candidate the
Nicaraguan right has been able to come up with - Arnoldo Alem&aacute;n.
Despite being largely discredited among many national sectors as a
result of the endless list of major corruption scandals linked to his
time as president (1990 - 96), Alem&aacute;n has natural leadership
qualities
and knows how to relate to the PLC&#8217;s grass roots supporters.</p>
      <p>Saying that though, the fact that the PLC is not going into
the
elections as Nicaragua's second force (its usual status) does represent
a significant disadvantage, as does the corroding effect the last six
or seven years of profound divisions within the party has had on the
confidence and morale of the PLC's traditional support base. </p>
      <p>Nicaraguan right in much weaker position than in 2006 </p>
      <p>Undeniably the Nicaraguan right wing opposition is going into
the
2011 general elections in a much weaker position than they did the 2006
elections. Not only is the right wing very much more divided than it
was five years ago (both in terms of the number of political currents
and the reach of internal divisions within those currents) but
politically, their arguments and positions have been thoroughly
discredited by the FSLN government's successful implementation of its
program.</p>
      <p>Since 1990 the right wing managed to keep the FSLN out of
power by
claiming a Sandinista government would amount not just to an economic
debacle but also to the return of some sort of armed conflict. It was
the effectiveness of this fear campaign and not the results of their
own programs of government that kept the right in power for sixteen
years. </p>
      <p>The last four years of FSLN government have had the effect of
giving
the lie to the right's anti FSLN propaganda while the Sandinista
government's success in bringing about major improvements to all
aspects of Nicaragua's national life (economy, road and energy
generation infrastructure, health care and education to mention only
the most obvious) has had the effect of underlining to Nicaraguan
voters the right wing parties' scandalous ineffectiveness when they
were in power. </p>
      <p>And the recent change in the main right wing candidates'
discourse
in which promises have been made that the social and infrastructural
programs implemented by the FSLN since 2007 will be maintained if they
win the elections is likely to fall on deaf ears as the Nicaraguan
electorate asks itself why, then, the right wing did not implement such
programs during the sixteen years they were in office. </p>
      <p>To achieve goal of 50 plus deputies, FSLN must fight
complacency</p>
      <p>Around the time of the inscription of political alliances
earlier
this month the FSLN's official aim to not just win the presidency but
also to win a majority of 50 or more seats in the National Assembly
came to light. (Currently the FSLN alliance holds 38 of the 92 National
Assembly seats.)</p>
      <p>Poll results over the last year or so would lead one to
believe that
it is by no means unreasonable for the FSLN to expect to fulfill this
aim. The experience of the 1989 presidential elections when the FSLN
unexpectedly lost to Violeta Barrios and the UNO alliance, however, had
the effect of teaching the FSLN leaders the bitter lesson that
complacency and triumphalism are the party's worst enemies when it
comes to election time. </p>
      <p>In order to ensure a majority in the Nicaraguan legislative,
the
FSLN - as its leaders are fully aware - will need to work hard to raise
awareness among its active grass roots support network about the need
to go after every last possible vote, with special emphasis on the
votes of those who normally abstain or vote for right wing parties. </p>
      <p>Should the FSLN achieve 50 plus deputies in November's
elections it
would represent a definite historical shift in terms of Nicaraguan
politics in which the Sandinistas consolidate themselves as the natural
party of government for the first time since 1986. Such a victory would
also hail a new phase of this FSLN government in which the party is
much freer to bring about more profound social and economic change
without being obliged to take into account the weight of a right wing
majority in the country's parliament. </p>
      <p>But seven and a half months is a long time in today's world,
shaken
so violently by the unpredictable and ever changing fallout of numerous
global crises. In this sense it is difficult to anticipate to what
extent and in what ways the fluctuating international situation will
affect the Central American region and, more specifically, Nicaragua in
the run up to the country's presidential elections.</p>
